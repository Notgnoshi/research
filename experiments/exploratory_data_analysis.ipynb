    "* Analyze word frequencies before and after removing stop words. Consider the rarest words, and potentially remove the containing haikus from the dataset.\n",
    "* \"grey\" vs \"gray\" and other British spellings.\n",
    "* Build a word cloud. This could be interesting to get a sense of what kind of language is in the dataset.\n",
    "  * Build word cloud after removing stop words.\n",
    "  * Identify haiku-specific stop words.\n",
    "  * Build word cloud after stemming/lemmatization.\n",
    "  * Do the same thing for flowers, colors, season bigrams, wind bigrams, etc.\n",
    "* Interesting bi and tri-grams. '`*` hour', '`*` blossom(s)', '`*` season `*`', '`*` wind', `<flower name>` etc.\n",
    "* What birds are mentioned. What flowers? What animals?\n",
    "* There was a PyCon talk about the colors in works of literature. Can I do the same with haikus?\n",
    "* Check whether Zipf's law holds for the haiku dataset.\n",
    "* Find haikus that are very similar to each other (small edit distance)\n",
    "* Find outliers\n",
    "* There's an essay on haiku FAQ [here](http://haiku.ru/frog/alexey_def.htm). There are educational links [here](https://www.ahapoetry.com/Bare%20Bones/bbtoc%20intro.html) and [here](https://www.ahapoetry.com/all%20haiku%20info.html) on how to write haikus.\n",

    "* Attempt ML sentiment analysis.\n",
    "* Can the haikus be clustered by their topics, sentiments, or something else?\n",
    "  * The topics will be a vector of words? So can the vectors be clustered?\n",
    "* Can an RNN find the appropriate line breaks?\n",
    "  * Variable length inputs and outputs will be tricky\n",
    "  * Look into seq2seq where there's an encoder and decoder at both ends of the RNN.\n",
    "* How many haikus actually follow the 5-7-5 common pattern?\n",
    "  * Need to find a good way to count syllables\n",
    "  * Also look at number of lines\n",
    "* Naive haiku generation with Markov chains and LSTM networks\n",
    "* Think about grammatical evolution with some kind of encoding and production rules"
