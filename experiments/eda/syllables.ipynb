    "# The Haiku Form\n",
    "\n",
    "Haiku are a form of Japanese poetry.\n",
    "They are the first three lines of a *waka*, which is a 5-7-5-7-7 poem, also known as a *tanka* or *uta*.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Waka* were often strung together into *renga*, which is a linked verse dialog between multiple poets.\n",
    "One poet would compose the first 5-7-5 syllables, then another would respond with the next 7-7 syllables, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of these long poems, the first three 5-7-5 lines are called a *hokku*.\n",
    "The *hokku* are the most recognizable and impressionable verses of *renga*, analgous to the first verse and chorus of a popular song.\n",
    "*Renga* were composed in meetings of several poets, and it was common for poets to come prepared with pre-composed *hokku*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the strict 17-syllable structure is difficult (impossible) to maintain in translation.\n",
    "Thus many translators strive to match the style, theme, and mood of a Japanese haiku, maintaining its three-line structure, but abandoning the strict syllabic requirement.\n",
    "Further note that, as with any art style, there was experimentation with freer verse styles, in both content and structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "However in *The Haiku Form*, Joan Giroux defines\n",
    "\n",
    "> A haiku is a 17-syllable poem arranged in three lines of 5, 7, and 5 syllables, having some reference to the season and expressing the poet's union with nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "and still suggests that the 17-syllable structure applies to native English haiku just as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to empirically answer the question:\n",
    "How many haiku actually follow the common 5-7-5 syllable pattern?\n",
    "\n",
    "> asshole questioning\n",
    ">\n",
    "> doesn't know about haiku\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 5-7-5 bitch\n",
    "\n",
