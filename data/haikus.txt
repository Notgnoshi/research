sun-bleached billboard
the gravel road ends
at peaches

flute notes
fluttering
petals

the rill's trick
a greenfinch moves
its green around

the first stroke
of the ink brush
ravens in snow

evening prayer
the sediment
begins to settle

a turnstile
going around by itself
winter rain

winter solitude
lost in the hum
of my computer

light
for their world
fireflies

gathering dusk
all the colored pencils
back in their cup

the dogs
shake it loose
summer sea

watermelon flesh
deep in summer

trial separation
another inch of snow
on the gin bottles

summer holiday
walking the dogs
where they want to go

window to window
and back
the cat

spindrift
i go where
the story takes me

drifting snowflakes
the police car’s ascent
up our driveway

evening breeze
through the barnboards
final bid

our easy silence
every puddle
sky-deep

wedding invitations
the press and release
of the nib

paddling through stars
the wake of a boat
long passed

pride parade
from behind a cloud
the sun comes out

stone cairns
a faded cap drifts
downriver

jasmine beyond
the honeycombed lattice
a call to prayer

sand dunes
by morning
a different dream

early morning
mist reunites
the hills

the underside of leaves
her back story
changes everything

snow crocus
my grandson asks
if i have dreams

county fair
second place ribbon
in an empty stall

junk car
the hum of bees
beneath the hood

the christmas
after we told them
artificial tree

a bit of rust
on the chevy's fender
harvest moon

a lightning strike
gives up a flower

forest clearing
a scapula
left for the moon

that time of year
moonlight fills
his empty chair

birding
the unfamiliar path
home

winter solstice
the tilt
of her hospital bed

first morning
firecracker papers
wander the streets

flies wait it out
under a cow’s chin
spring shower

heartwood
the saw changes
its tune

snow field
the earth marked
by fallen angels

setting sun
an accordion squeezes
the night air

no moon
the click of stilettos
on cobblestones

flowing estuary
native languages
long gone

in the hot tub
my eyes on her floating breasts
hunters moon

rosebud unfolding
the seed packet left behind
in revelations

no escaping
this moonlight
pompeii

river mud
the shape
of boys

desert twilight
a map with many creases
nailed to a cross

we huddle
over mother’s open grave
lawless winter

a long bus ride
the prophetic language
of the stops

navajo moon
the coyote call
not a coyote

deleting words
from the eulogy
falling leaves

calla lily
the sound of a ladder
lengthening

tasting the well
in the water
summer stars

mother’s day
the expiration date
on wildflower seeds

northern lights
the scratchy play
of seventy-eights

a recurring escape
from my father’s dream

the big dipper
no matter where i stand
mountain sky

summer passing
the yard flamingo’s
rusty legs

glint of sunlight
the respirator carries on
alone

all souls day
my name called
from the front gate

autumn
an empty booster seat
in the barber's window

hunter's cabin
of the woods
not of it

end of the walk
returning the crow's feather
where i found it

cafe for sale
outdoor tables rusting
into autumn

day lilies
another death date added
to the family tree

the house finch
has a song for it
morning after snow

crescent moon
a bone carver sings
to his ancestor

close enough to touch
i let the junco lead me
away from its nest

blowing leaves
tempt the old cat
but not enough

ancient mountains
runners clearing hurdles
on the practice field

thanksgiving
fifteen minutes
of mince pie

blossoms
the baby’s bare feet
pedal the air

butterfly
my attention
attention span

one moth
a thousand candles
light the darkness

trail’s end
my pebble
settles the cairn

family reunion
some of the beached kelp
in knots

a jar of pennies
on the lemonade stand
evening cool

lightning
the scarecrow's coat sleeve
caught in mid-wave

summer's end
the hammock turned in
on itself

charcoal alley
children flick marbles
into the light

season of lights
the postman
leans to the wind

having no thought
we've come to see them
dogwoods in bloom

turning tide
placing intact clams
back in the water

mallard pair
he rocks
on her wake

filtering in
with the night air
a skunk's warning

stone in my pocket
the brook cuts deeper
into the mountain

a bee chose
the rose i meant to pluck
empty vase

soba noodles
the new year
slips in

hazy dusk
no one bothered to plow
the graveyard road

child's wake
the weight
of rain

gunshot
the length of the lake

a stick caught
on the lip of the dam
winter's end

summer stars
the old violin goes
to the highest bidder

winter drags on
i squeeze the last drops
from a teabag

distant thunder
a titmouse gives one chirp
and falls silent

alzheimer's birthday
each slice of the cake
takes part of her name

march winds
a decade has passed
by your grave

indian summer
a spent salmon
washes ashore

after the funeral
whiskers still
in his razor

the page-finders
of my father’s daily missal
losing their colors

first buds of spring
i change the washer’s setting
to delicate

among the gravestones
with names worn away
children play hide ‘n seek

whalebone
from a beach near savoonga
winter rain

all saints morning
a path
of trodden leaves

cremated
in her favorite kimono
small green plums

spring rain
the gravedigger latches the door
of his backhoe

spring rain
the cat's pink nipples

loon calls
my daughter drawing circles
near the fire

summer evening
from across the meadow
a call to supper

shivering on the roof
i rub my palms together
meteor shower

ocean breeze
a strand of seaweed
steadies the kite

autumn rose
even as i sketch the wind
more petals fall

humid july
from the stove the smell
of old fires

the wind of autumn
a homeless man warms himself
hand to mouth

broken easel
the front yard blue
with wildflowers

heat waves
the hitchhiker shifts her child
to the other hip

land's end
sand in each bite
of my apple

indian summer
a fish slips through
the gill net

her 18th birthday
for the first time she notices
my silences

spring sunshine
the climbing ivy
filled with sparrows

meteor shower
a gentle wave
wets our sandals

mountain hike
we drink from the beginning
of a great river

spring sun
high in his arms
the newborn is shown

snail
to know
its heart beats too

lethal injection
unable to shut
the blind dog's eyes

end of summer
the shape of his feet
in his sneakers

geronimo's grave
someone has left
plastic flowers

new in town
the scent
of unknown flowers

foghorns
we lower a kayak
into the sound

catalog time
the garden begins
without a seed

new butterfly
folded wings
lean into the wind

morning overcast
a few seeds still dangle
from the dandelion

break up
i leave behind
her butterfly net

walking home barefoot
we enter the shadow
of the hill

autumn evening
a page of the old book
separates from the spine

funeral procession
snowflakes blowing
into the headlights

autumn evening
my hospital window
becomes a mirror

storm clouds
the cry of a shearwater
circles the sky

late into the night
we talk of revelations
moon through the pines

the kettle whistles
a blur of garden color
on the window

winter beach
a piece of driftwood
charred at one end

riveredge old growth
a towering window
of stars

i'm caught in it too
the blossom-loosening wind

over the railroad tracks
the slow motion
of a snake

the beetle i righted
flies straight into
a cobweb

leaf in my palm
its stem extends
my lifeline

about the tree
over my small son's grave
tell me

musty smell
forgotten deep
into the text

that venus!
leading the cupped moon
through every turn of the road

grabs and opens
the fist
sowing seeds

the river
coming to it with nothing
in my hands

deep silence
the orphaned nestlings
this third morning

summer solstice
the long tips of lavender
bent by bees

snowbound
coloring inside
the lines

the dumproad pond
tadpoles exit
a birdhouse

still sun-warmed
the pulled-out scarecrow
in my arms

changing the swallowtail
changed by it
the spring wind

letting the branch go
a shower of petals falls
on the old woman

toll booth lit for christmas
from my hand to hers
warm change

winter seclusion
tending all day
the small fire

on the path
only one of us
touched by a falling leaf

winter bedtime
static flickers
through a white sleeve

warm river
up to our necks
in sunset

beneath the ice
the waterfall
still falling

old garden chair
sagging with the weight
of a single leaf

after the stroke
watching only the half of your face
that smiles

city window
mountains and pines
etched in frost

autumn deepens
an empty snail shell
explored by an ant

early morning sun
scattered on the table
several grains of salt

snowflakes
no one will miss
melt in her hand

bright leaves
blow through
her dream house

scattering his ashes
the moon
in bits and pieces

on the river
of many names one cloud
floating

learning too late
he didn't like bubinga wood
sun strikes the urn

the war memorial
migrating butterflies
cover the names

falling leaves
the house comes
out of the wood

leaving you
fog on either side
of the white heron

below zero
all curled up in the woodpile
the skin of a snake

deep winter
the armload of firewood
chills the kitchen

mourning dove calls
my elderly neighbor stills
the sound of her hoeing

august morning
a window washer wiping dust
from his sunglasses

snowmelt
she enters
the earth on her knees

an old woolen sweater
taken yarn by yarn
from the snowbank

a white horse
drinks from the acequia
blossoming locust

sunlight shines red
through my father's thumb
on the steering wheel

two women crying
one giving birth
the other being born

approaching the family plot
my furled umbrella
turns into a cane

chernobyl victim
fingers pressing the plastic
to his wife's caress

cloud shadow
long enough to close
the poppies

the thick clang
of a cowbell
the sun deepens

roses
in the smaller room
more fragrant

ninety winters
spellbound
again

silent cathedral
stained-glass apostles
dimming with dusk

up the path
to touch that one oak
in last night's dream

dry leaves
the old archer
curves his eyebrow

soft rain
the new grave
looks old

morning sneeze
the guitar in the corner
resonates

dusk
a lone car going the same way
as the river

first days of summer
already the leaves gather
beneath the sycamores

fall leaves
the trees
the winter sky

so many ways
within the waterfall
for water to fall

after the rain
on my vegetable patch
a new crop of stones

frozen in mud
by the vacant shanty
lottery ticket

the potter's hands
gently shape the vase
out of himself

watermelon rind
sitting in its own juice
the summer sun

figure drawing class
in the model's deepest shadows
a stark white string

ebb tide
a little sea
in the shell

watching rain
pouring down pouring down
just watching

abandoned store
large sign reading
we never close

a single strand
of spider silk
stops her

endlessly becoming
clouds

taking time
listening
to the grocery clerk

in the yukon
sleeping with one eye shut
the summer night

in soap bubbles
again and again
his face is broken

yard sale
sunlight filling
mason jars

leaving home
the smell of smoke
from old brick chimneys

frozen pond
white antlers rise
through the ice

june night
my mother alone with
her cancer

at dinner
biting into the roast beef
the butcher's thumb nail

phoning the neighbors
their real voices
through the open window

repeating the lecture
his eyes following
the window-cleaner's blade

tools rusting
unused on the work bench
a faucet dripping

full moon
peering into
the half-built house

dusk
drawing the pond's depth
to the surface

old woman wrapping
her cat's gifts
centering the bows

on the way to work
a hot air balloon
up in the mist

this heat
the dog's tail
the only breeze

light
up under the gull's wing
sunrise

second husband
painting the fence
the same green

such coolness
the snail stretches
its neck

the one legged bird
that deep bend before
taking off

bird song
lost
in bird song

walking in on her
dead eyes reflecting
snowfall

in the sea
the fireworks
rising

bird feeder untouched
alone again

circling each thigh
cool
of the night river

small child
afraid to throw away
his church bulletin

in utter stillness
the incense
changes direction

early spring sun
the spinster combs out her hair
for nesting birds

canyon
at the very edge
riversound

out of its slipper
her bare foot talking
under the table

burial prayers
grandson playing hide and seek
behind the stones

between the fireflies
the changing shape of darkness

my father's hammer
warm again
in my hand

under trees and sky
the baby studies
her hands

migrating geese
once there was so much
to say

sound of her voice
carrying eggs
across the ice

moving
with the clock tower's shadow
the flower lady

heart drawn in dust
by the old indian
rain

whispered dusk
a fox picks its way
across the ice

mist
lifting
the loon's cry

snowman's eye
sinking in
the spring rain

autumn afternoon
i stand on the shadow
of the sparrow

ten below zero
man and boy walk through their breath
to read old tombstones

hot wind
the roadrunner's beak
opens and closes

blackbirds descend
through the floaters
in this eye

the old man
closes the shadow
in his hand

spring drizzle
rounding the thorn
a drop of light

horizon
wild swan drifting through
the woman's body

deserted wharf
the mime bows
to the moon

a spider's web
across the windharp
the silence

under the back steps
catfish still flop in the pail
the long august night

horns fold
at my shadow's touch
brown slug

early april rain
that woman fills every jar
seals them forever

dead mynah bird
with each passing car
its wing flaps

picking cotton
the memory
of birdtracks in the snow

old tea bag
tints the moon
slightly

blackened walnut
left unopened
winter solstice

distant woodchopper
inside the cabin
axbite echoes

the gray cranes at dusk
bending in a line along
the crooked fenceposts

checking for water
the woman finds a full moon
trapped in the cistern

old woman
rain in the eye
of her needle

the path shorter now
underfoot the crumbling leaves
the child runs ahead

cry of the peacock
widens the crack
in the adobe wall

fields of snow
not only moonlight
but the moon

cold morning sea
an old man towels
himself in the sunlight

fields of corn stretching
as far as the eye can see
within a lost child

crossing the bright sky
of a near-sighted swimmer
the song of a bird

and yet
perishable is flesh
a mountain plum

what thing cries out
deep inside us
cooking the turtle?

lights out
the firefly
inside

the wind
somewhere else
bird tracks in a light snow

apples cooking
in the aroma
pictures of my mother canning

dawn
another parting
with the moon

back and forth
goldfish
hot and humid afternoon

the child
points at the moon
and says bird

one seagull
on a shaft of air
dawn

lean man
carving
the tree's dream

morning-glory
folds into herself
into her folds

from behind me
the shadow of the ticket-taker
comes down the aisle

part of a dog
walking by upside down
in the roadside puddle

where the ripple was
the fisherman casts his line
another ripple

quiet strokes
of night swimmer the slap
of beaver tails

never expecting
the lilies in november
nor the small coffin

the room's smallness
fills with light
this morning of snow

the way of the conch
blueing in the sea and
echoing in the wind

leaving
all the morning glories
closed

old frog
up to his ears
in moonlight

reaching into sky
the girl breaks the wish
bone of geese

in a dark bag
onions
sprouting

still lake
a hawk makes off
with its image

skiers!
standing
on the wind

of naked barbies

i choose a bench that supports
my views

in my dream

to knot the tie

in a stranger

in their sleep

about grief

on an escher print

into a corner

the crowd arrives
right on time

the summer wind
turns color

without a face

every which way

drips off the end
of my elbows

reflects in the sea

higher

in my palm

on the soles of shoes

getting louder
the calf
the auctioneer

from tree shadow
to fence shadow

with my eyes never ending snow

the petals scatter
over graves swept
and unswept

a single leaf falling
and with it
the morning dew

mountain rose
from thorn to thorn
a spider’s line

coming out of the woods
the sound of crickets
the empty sky

an old woman with bread
waves the geese down
from the sky

over the earth’s edge
they all gothe white clouds
and the one sailboat

long beards longer
black clothes darker
under july sun

amish gentleman's
warm smile brief
my skirt long and plain

an amish grin
as he cycles past
the station selling gas

the gloom within
a handcrafts store
dolls with missing faces

facing mirrors
long-skirted woman
and her amish child

music on the wind
an amish foot softly taps
and abruptly stops

late night camp
now a gentle lullaby
horse hooves heading home

falling leaves
day by day
the house grows brighter

darkening path
the white morning glories
lead the way

in a backyard
two women folding sunlight
into sheets

late autumn
the billboard's shadow leans
into the woods

from the stream
two mallards fly straight up
through falling leaves

new year's eve blizzard
a neon beer-sign glows
behind the steamed window

spring breeze
the woods road is still wet
under the pines

the old watering can
hangs one more rainbow
among the roses

the evening paper
on the darkening lawn
first star

a letter stuck
in the 11th floor mail chute
summer night

the blues singer
tells how bad it is
then the sax tells you too

quiet afternoon
in the meadow one daisy
leans on another

at the end of a tunnel in the clouds
a sunlit billow

crossing the tracks
at twilight
the autumn wind

chilly sunrise
a strip of bark flutters
on the lake-side birch

twiddling my thumbs
the sun goes down
the moon comes up

winter drizzle
unloading a crate of live ducks
behind the chinatown restaurant

snow melts by the hardware counter
the squares of color
in the paint catalog

in the mirrors on her dress
little pieces of my
self

a few blocks
from the street festival
the evening quiet

at the pow-wow
they pass out ordinary saltines
for the ceremony

while his passengers sleep
the bus driver watches dawn
break

by the lawn's edge
the dog barks at the darkness
then looks back at me

dead end
a few leaves circle
in the headlights

late at night
a woman alone in the restaurant
addressing christmas cards

snowy morning
the barber appears
in his mirrors

moonrise
the columbine still
swinging

changing pitchers
the base-runner looks up
at a passing cloud

in the subway
the young conductor cues
imaginary oboes

climbing the stairs
more slowly
autumn evening

the frozen puddle
kids slide over a pattern
of red leaves

snow drifts
above the bear's den
starry night

cold spring rain
a piece of grass
sticks out of the birdhouse

up in the sky
hardly heard hardly seen
migrating birds

sundawn
a flutter of mourning doves
and poised light-bathed one faun
nearby a bell tolls changes

mapletree buds
their small shadows
in water-glazed mud
nearby a bell tolls changes

white lilac
fragrantly exuberant
beside the porchdeck
nearby a bell tolls changes

putting down a book
to listen to the god
in the half-cleared brook
nearby a bell tolls changes

high noon
straight-up trunks of poplars shadowless
a foreshadowing  soon soon?
nearby a bell tolls changes

watching a program
on brazil’s rain forests
anger poisons calm
nearby a bell tolls changes

on the grass
two pitched-from-a-car beer cans
unthinking ass!
nearby a bell tolls changes

a cardinal's song
blends with the brilliant sunset
surely nothing's wrong?
nearby a bell tolls changes

cicadas at dusk
seventeen years hence shall we see
substance or husk?
nearby a bell tolls changes

in moonlight
swish of owl wings this heartstab
glitter can gloss blight
nearby a bell tolls changes

first spring day
melting and melting and melting
tracks of the mountain man

night storm
a deeper dark unrolls
across the prairie

removing her wedding ring
she brushes it along
her husband's name

woman touches a name
while looking at
an old photo

elderly couple
their faces reflected
over their son's name

man in a filthy army jacket
tries to scratch on
his name

anzio beach
another wave gathers
and breaks

how many dew drops
make up these walls

on razor wire
squats a crow
winter night

the guards in their towers
silk worms in cocoons of light

black-uniformed winter fly
greeting me
behind bullet-proof glass

walls of ice
deep in forests
frozen frogponds

my silver shackles
gossamer threads
under these stars

old guard escorting me
coughing like bullfrog
cigarette smoke for breath

prison cat in shadows
stalking the shaft of searchlight

capturing snowflake fireflies
with my tongue

beating time with nightstick
cricket sound
while i urinate

oh winter moon
what have you done now
keep-locked with the mountains

a thousand temple bells
the noise of the cell block

suddenly
they all look like
green bullfrogs

decorating my cell again
i notice roommate
a silverfish on my pillow

from out of henderson’s haiku
my old wife’s photograph
cells doors automatically locking

soothing rain
the mown meadow releases
pungence of mint

butterfly shadows
not finding
the butterfly

abandoned farmhouse
bird nest in the mail box
also deserted

abandoned farmhouse
wallpaper peeling back to
my childhood

abandoned farmhouse
something scratching
inside the furnace

abandoned farmhouse
the quiet bedroom where i
feared the dark

abandoned farmhouse a
yellowed grocery list taped
to the counter top

abandoned farmhouse a
moth flies out of the water
faucet

abandoned farmhouse
my daughter
snaps pictures of our visit

into old pots and pans
thrown out in the backyard
the musical rain

here and there
in bare treetops
mistletoe

in a shabby motel
all night
treefrogs in rain

cottonmouths
in the swamp
a house on stilts

family get-together
all the eyes all the feelers
all the hands tearing shrimp

morning in the french quarter
cafe au lait and
beignets with sparrows

the river wind blows
into the quarter
and through his saxophone

on the riverfront
a stranger
takes my smile

the breeze
off the mississippi
fills my skirt

behind grillwork
down darkness to sun
in a hidden courtyard

cool the alley
through the grillwork swirls
cat pee smell

in the morning shops
half the doorways
fill with shade

all the mardi gras colors
in the masks
in the houses

on the iron lace balconies
only flowers
sunning

from the suite dusk
fills in the river
and all the tiny lights are slow

huge limbs of the live oak
their reaching out
over the young grass

in a pecan grove
wandering spring shadows
cows and blackbirds

parked on the runway
its wings drooped a b52
the winter sun

the slow day
in the empty motel corridor
a stack of dirty dishes

sundown in the empty bar
the player-piano keys
begin

the big waitress departs
the china teapot
shakes

january sun
the cotton fields
dotted with leftovers

longest night
his forehead burning
into my hand

what passion
you had akiko
where can i put
even an inch
of tonight's anguish!

sucking
chocolate squares
oh it's a lonely beginning
this first night of return
to japan

under this basholess
pre-dawn sky
how rough
the angle of loneliness
along this eastern sea

bent
like a puzzle
in a child's hand
that back before me
in the pre-dawn dark

is it a walking
umbrella?
immense the black
over that bent-against-the-wind
angle of loneliness

a crane
skipping before me
on this seaside road
its leg
a karate lift?

i hug
the boy to me
how brave he was to point and say
this is a pencil
this is a cup

on my office couch
i lean back
back
this nescafe's
the length of my desire

in this bare
late-afternoon life
i make
my bare dinner
and set out fork and knife

wanting
to embrace
even a sleeve
tonight's
lonely angle

gone from the wood
the bird i knew
by song alone

on lookout rock
one step
to the red hawk

a red shaft of light
dances on your moist eyelids
the searing morning

frog mountain rises
to arch its back in the clouds
unforeseen downpour

three men and three birds
stand still in the forest all
surprised by rain

rain like the deluge
a mudspattered apache
sings in cibecue

the day hides itself
within a grove of aspen
thunder pursues it

uprooted clouds
summer holds the pale mountains
calls down the clear night

cajun cabin
the aroma of hot gumbo
floats on the bayou

gunshot
the tide of gulls breaks
like a scattering wave

gathering silence
in my mind is
the hardest thing to do

against the wind's chill
i button my sweater
feet dug in sand

the sun slips low
a carnelian red paving
the water with dark light

how many wanderers
have followed the sun
down?

the girl with the soul
of a gull
never came back

questions
purl like schools of fish
in dangerous waters

questions
without breath without answers
a broken shell

on the cardboard box
holding the frozen wino
fragile do not crush

from the fire escape
the cry of the mourning dove
wintering over

new condominium
its exhaust grate claimed by
a new derelict

wind chill minus five
the piercing whistles
of the starlings

the young mother
stoops to warm the child's mittens
between her gloves

between lace curtains
the white cat's eyes
follow a snowflake

a crow flies down
to land in the new snow
its voice ringing

madison avenue
a row of ginkgoes mulched
with old xmas trees

suet on a string
suspended from a snowy branch
three sparrows make it spin

in the shadow of
office buildings bagpiper's
amazing grace

last night’s fading dream
on the blue teapot birds drift
beyond the willows

under cloudless skies
nuclear resister jailed
missiles free to fly

april sun slanting
across the exercise yard
jail-bar shadows

basketball stops
in the exercise yard
convicts shoot the breeze

this heat
snow-clad mountains framed
by my jail cell window

little ladybug
caught after visiting hours
doing jail time too

starting a new month
in snohomish county jail
same old tea bag

chilly june morning
in a spider web
the jailhouse fly hangs

sixty day jail term
as it grows shorter
my growing beard

a swallowtail
settles
on the prize-winning quilt

summer afternoon
the priest takes a blue pencil
from the blind man

coming up through
a gap in the city bridge
a checkerspot butterfly

backfire
a checkerspot in its sound
shifts direction

dog coming out
with the cathedral crowd
tail upward

half way home
pole shadows reach across
the widening road

train whistle
two jets wrap the sky
with mist

a block from home
a pair of rain drops find
my haiku notes

snow geese
sarah discovers
the letter v

suddenly
twenty years later
you taste the same

through two marriages
framed behind beethoven
your picture

talking with him
i taste you
in the tea you serve

on your porch
only the breeze
moves between us

in the dark car
the scent of you
and the rainy fields

juice from the apple
runs into my beard
as i wait for you

in the mirror
the only picture
of us together

your perfume
looking up startled
at a stranger

in the cold fireplace
my last letter
burning

still in the taste
of afternoon tea
my grandmother’s brogue

a horse-drawn plow
sunflowers stand
in the traces

eaves
pulling sound
from the wind

walking alone
the way oak leaves
refuse to fall

a steady rain
the dentist’s drill
turning to snow

top of the falls
your voice somewhere
in its sound

the worm
far out on this paved lot
more rain

autumn dusk
the crooked road home

winter morning
the closet dark with
old shoes

the family gathered
a tear of embalming fluid runs
from my brother’s eye

a moth flies
through my breath
in moonlight

bitter wind
the hand that cups the flame
aglow

the sound of scissors
through quilt stuffing
chill autumn moon

autumn maple
a gust of yellow scatters
the child’s laughter

autumn sky
the wind folds and unfolds
a flock of sparrows

moving into the sun
the pony takes with him
some mountain shadow

paddling slowly
through the reeds
that touch her hair

the old woman
looking into the stars
sky all snowy

against his coat
i brush my lips
the silence of snowflakes

away from eyes
the stairwell holds
us in its arms

that sonofabitch
on the corner has a knife
the rain glistens on it

still
childless
milkweed

winter’s end
a bitterness remaining
in the dried apricots

the old garden fence
now keeps the goldenrod
from the goldenrod

thin icicles
on the telephone wire
her distant voice

hoping the shape
of the navel will be good
father cuts the cord

one cricket
sound and silence
lighting the autumn garden

hot rock by the stream
each of the baby’s toeprints
evaporating

switching off the light
switching off the shadows

summer breeze
the flutter of clothes
thrown over a chair

pebbles underfoot
in the cold stream
stars

in front
of the meth lab
three children hopscotch

ash wednesday
from lines of silent people
a cough echoes

spring evening
rain soaks through the newspaper
on my head

hovering
over a damp field
a cloud of gnats

dawn
dust dances
on shafts of sunlight

summer dusk
throwing stones
through a broken window

on an old
cemetery stone
my name

mountain stream
trout dart
around watercress

monday morning
kicking the slush
from behind the wheels

autumn wind
rattles the glass
a child's breath

walking
the pumpkin patch
children's faces aglow

from the tanning salon
to her car
january chill

strep throat
she kisses him
anyway

after the dentist appointment
sister returns
all smiles

new beau
fingering the tattoo
with her name

spring morning
the dewy grass
holds the shape of her step

thanksgiving dinner
silence and the
pendulum swinging

elizabeth frank age 17 grade 12

a whale's last call
the blue sea

autumn afternoon
hole in the stone wall
a perfect frame

from orion
a bat flits
to the moon

mountain view photo
capturing
the tourist's breath

farming
his hands
showing the work

concentration
on the runner's forehead
birdpoop

at the movie
their hands meet
in the buttered popcorn

mother's crossed arms
a reminder
of our argument

overhead projector
the lesson
over a student's head

after the rain
so visible
the spider's web

photograph
for a moment
everything still

smiling at him
in the old pictures
he smiles back

the quiet girl
wearing
a loud shirt

finding myself
between the willows
autumn evening

signs of spring
tanktop revealing
her butterfly tattoo

leaf pattern
arranged
rearranged by the wind

first snow
the whole pomegranate
one seed at a time

silence i wait
for the starter's pistol

rain
finding
the hole in my shoe

first date
her dog
likes me

dark street
a lit cigarette
moves closer

halloween
my feelings
behind a mask

solitary swimmer
ripples
the early-morning sun

old man
reeling in
the sea

after the flood
our flag waves
from the clothesline

dandelion
wished
away

the tree
snowcovered
except one leaf

two oak leaves
just the same
until a brown moth flies away

two bold streaks of blue
split by the thin horizon
ocean and spring sky

digging potatoes
my dog barks
at the shovel

pheasant hunting
his hand too cold
to pull the trigger

turning the corner
he turns his hat
in a different direction

eucharist
white
on my dirty palm

rain
he holds out
his hands

grandmother's smile
spreads
into a yawn

in the corner
of my bedroom
in the silent house

i watch myself
walking
past the still lake

emergency room
watching the spider
cross the floor

goodnight embrace
by the dusty road
all the stars

earthquake
on the chesstable
the horse hits the king

inside the box
sits a doll
shoeless

striped fish
criss-crossed
by a salty net

indian chant
only white men
dancing

silent study hall
my stomach growls
anyway

after his funeral
the white line
on her tanned finger

i and the dog
hunting together
the evening mosquitoes

inside its shell
a snail
and rain

butterflies in the air
in the herbarium
deep silence

new mother
her old cat appears
at nursing time

as the sun rises
the flowers open
slowly

blowing out
a match
the sudden smell

christmas day
the hunters
feed the deer

father home
late again
my mother's eyes

chemistry
between lab partners

day after the big test
the nurse's office
empty

beautiful girl
i turn my head and run
the red light

out of our flavor
ice cream man
swears in spanish

train
flattened
penny

relationship
broken

mad at myself
the ball keeps hitting
its own shadow

beside the waterfall
the little girl
wets her pants

light of a million stars
still
the darkness

seashells
take me
from the shore

under the tree
a planted feather

he gives me
roses
and their thorns

i see his wholeness
through the gap
in his teeth

sax solo
of his eyes
only the white

behind an old hut
i drink from the well
of the past

nowhere to go
the old guitar
and rain song

orange harvest
the passing train
takes the sweet scent

too much grief
quietly i oil and sharpen
the old chainsaw

a morning glory
covered with spider's web
one or two fly wings too

like an unexpected leafage
your tongue encircles me

dense fog
i dream walk
my sense of i

the coot careful
as if tomorrow is sane
ripples in a pond

winter evening
a voice greeting a neighbor
sounds like my own

anzac day
a baby's cry
fills our minute's silence

afternoon beach
the young lovers
cast a single shadow

work on the page
ink white erasures copy words
quick quick go and pee

after the rain
the river its weight

clock tower
here the wind never stops

between the echoes
of our voices
our voices

pioneer cemetery
here and there
a name faces heaven

fierce blizzard
frozen flowers on the glass
your hot breath

over the yard
intertwined fragrances
of the grill and cherry

twilight the shadows
overshadowed

convalescence
on my fingers
the smell of tangerines

roasting sun
the egret's measured steps
in buffalo shadow

behind the procession
the scent of the flowers
crushed underfoot

the buzzards
from the antenna
watch the sunset

breakfast in bed
your raisin cinnamon kiss

dreary afternoon
a carp in the park pond
snaps at a speck of sun

off the stone
drop by drop the sea
returns to the sea

a shooting star
no time for a wish
only her name

leaving home
the children's bubbles
in spring wind

stolen
by a naughty wind
the child's hat

three boxes of vinyls
a suitcase full of paperbacks
two lives meet

drifting chimney smoke
becomes an october sky
my hair grows gray

drifting snow
the old sheepdog
feigns a roll

an old woman buys snowdrops
listens sixty years ago
to a thrush

walking up the hill
we feel for each other
feeling our age

i love saturday night he said
then began crying
into his beer

migrating geese
her scent finally gone
from my pillow

lives of the poets
immortalized on the page
a small squashed insect

yew-shaded tombstone
on its faint inscription
stands an empty wineglass

month after month
on the counselor's face
a counselor's mask

rain and the ghosts of rain
conjure the mountain
everything will disappear

early dark
the cathedral visible
only as windows

two cups of cold tea
clink together on the nightstand
with each creak of the bed

cobwebs
in cracked window glass
an unknown face

nothing to wake me
after the birds
since you oiled the gate

the cow's measuring eye
dismisses me
for more important things

our house for sale
the trees we planted
sparkle with this morning's rain

calling home
the color of mother's voice
before her words

she waits with me
at the crossing
the light

hay's almost in
summer's too short here
for romance

all those things
i wish now i'd asked you
snow falling

she moves out
filling the empty room
spring light

laughter among the graves
the days of man are as grass
but today's a picnic

foghorns
we lower a kayak
into the sound

walking with the river
the water does my thinking

distant virga
the ranch dog's eyes
different colors

he removes his glove
to point out orion

icy rain
at the bottom of the lake
a door to yesterday

a love letter
to the butterfly gods
with strategic misspellings

cold aegean sun
the temple
half stone half shadow

vaster than the prairie
this wind

distant thunder
the dog's toenails
click against the linoleum

pausing halfway up the stairs
white chrysanthemum

hot day
the mime leans
into a wind that isn't there

late august
i bring him the garden
in my skirt

before we knew its name
the indigo bunting

after the garden party
the garden

as we got closer
the rainbow disappeared

say no words
time is collapsing
in the woods

after the heavy rains
so many skies tonight
reflecting the moon

on the brim
of a brimming stone bowl
a stone

a blue anchor
grains of grit
in a tall sky sewing

spring wind
i too am dust

daughter waters
father weeds
their silence

innumerable raindrops
on the reservoir
i stop to count some

walking farther into it
the farther it moves away
spring mist

damp morning
cash for a journey
warm from the machine

from house to barn
the milky way

after the quake
the weathervane
pointing to earth

the shell i take
the shell it takes
ebb tide

river's song
a wounded turtle
slips into it

a deep gorge
some of the silence
is me

a line borrowed
from another poet
spring rain

looking up rules
of punctuation
the green hills

somewhere fireflies
are eating rhinos

all day long
i feel its weight
the unworn necklace

windfall apples
what i think about
what i think

slave cemetery
i scrape the moss
to find no name

snow light
not telling you
the whole dream

full moon
all our sounds
are vowels

pulling your sword
the flower trembled
as you approached

lonely grass
by the silent river
come my dear

briefly her eyes
unglue from the iphone
fireflies

stargazing
my brain begins
connecting dots

fireflies
the light bearers
stop so soon

sipping green tea
on the antebellum back porch
the foraging bees

a late summer tide
the rising and falling
of a tenor's voice

dried leaves
a child jingles a bell
on the pavement

summer break
a street child
peddles ice water

nagging rain
on the moon's face
a baby's whimpers

wave lashings
with every breath
the shore yields

distant shore
the expatriate yearns for home

holding hands
the old couple enjoys
the teens' stares

long road ahead
dressed in white
bodies of love

caged dove
strips of heavens
through the chicken wire

gabriela raises
the barbed wire crown

pouring rain
one umbrella
shoulder to shoulder

early morning sun
amber shades bursting in blue
still water meets sky

evening drizzle
notes from his guitar
perfume the air

a bird song
no need to know
the color of its wings

on spiderweb dew beads
where daybreak waits

the tightening
of a fishing line
how silence ends

factory pig
dreams of rainbows
organic

the horses are quiet
the full moon's light
freezes in the barn

one night's ice
it can carry nothing
but my shadow

motionless pond
a fish comes up to find out
where its bubble goes

a bitter scent
of just trimmed trees
wounds remain white

summer drought
flaking off of the bench
a butterfly

in the curtains
sun and summer breeze
are playing a shadow show

her empty seat
in the quiet living room
i miss her silence

just two kettle drum strokes
he had to do but precisely
and in a dinner jacket

her smile as she crossed her legs
what was it you said?

the coffin goes down
the volatile voices
of geese

daddy come quick and look
the sky is so full
of god's foot prints

the street a dancing school
all the leaves are learning
how to fall graciously

two pairs of shoes
stamp the cold into the ground
at the bus stop

the conductor
with his hands he's drawing
castles in the air

children play
with a home made rifle
dying beautifully

the two of them setting off
he is walking after his belly
she follows her lips

now it's completed
the rowan tree gives back
its leaves to the earth

flying fishes
what they learned in the waves
they apply in light

i am oldish
when my eyes close at night
my mouth opens up

while passing by
i caress the rosemary
it responds with scent

the rain and we
we tell each other everything
we don't say a word

motionless
the hare on the slope
all ears

out of her wheelchair
she reaches for a dandelion
she'll be twelve maybe

in the snow i'm reading
about sparrows the rabbit
and the mailman

breaking waves
among seaweed and driftwood
a teddybear

on all souls day
flowerpots on two legs
looking for a grave

girl on the bicycle
as you are getting smaller and smaller
my loneliness grows

with a chinese lantern in her hand
the moon saunters away
through the dunes

spring sun
my boy tells everyone
the same secret

arriving train
snow from all over the country
pasted to the front

bought three
for the price of two
needed one

march burial
a bumblebee sucking nectar
from funeral flowers

the sea at dusk
all the islands
pulling closer together

the skier stops
to make room
for the silence of the snow

snow melt
green fields growing
on the copper roof

afternoon sun
the ice-skaters shadow
in longer strides

swaying in the hammock
we forgot a snowdrift

watering
the plastic flowers
just in case

in my dreams
i drain the sea
fill the brush with blue

summer air
hibernating
in a beachball

spring wind
i make a wrong turn
just to tease you

soon autumn
i sit on the train
facing backwards

melody of wind
written with hot air balloons
on the horizon

i draw a breath
strike what i had written
in the harbor a gull takes wing

the rain
breaks the silence
between us

the loch ness monster
after the whisky
the ripples

darkness over the snow
only the foam of waves
makes the sea visible

the power lines stretched across
the kingdom of frost
north of all music

wild geese
the border guards
lower their weapons

the waterpond mirror
turns my familiar face
into someone else's

quiet snowfall
the manhole cover
found in another world

deep in the woods
far between people
thoughts wander

northern lights
the pine tops darken

my aging cat
jumping through the window
narrowly

sweeping my porch
my broom could never
soar to a quidditch game

resting in the dinghy
along the distant horizon
islands sway

the crows are cawing
on the other side of the wall
my father's grave

before the rain
the white stork
gets lost in the fog

wet feet
the taste of the medlars
after the thunderstorm

city pond
on the plastic duck
a snail

the dry leaves
far from the banana tree
wind in the park

before seeing it
the scent of hawthorn
afternoon in may

little maple
with the perching sparrow
a leaf falls off

in the pond
a black duck
looking back

alone in the night
not even the moon
for watching

the taste of water
in the hollow of my hands
river in winter

gleam of moonlight
in the tracks
left by the sailors

seemed to be dead
when fishing it out of the water
a grasshopper

blanket of snow
the shadow of the trees
even darker

hands full
he leans them against her chest
the mandarins

waxing moon
in the neighboring garden
a cat in heat

tomb without snow
the afternoon moon
footprints and flowers

the dead blackbird
and its yellow beak
remains yellow

the colt on its hind legs
and even the algae of the river
in bloom

the piece of land
covers itself this year
with daisies

cold morning
the church has filled
with human scent

march rain
inside out in the ditch
a rabbit skin

only the shadow
of a cloud on the snow
no trace at all

cold as the morning
the skin of the persimmons
recently picked

children's siesta
watermelons and muskmelons
under the camp-beds

walking until
the pathway has become
open country

along the path of withered leaves
the hedgehog the wind
and the moon

at low altitude
a blackbird over the lawn
smell of rain

pedalling against
the north wind
smell of fig trees

breaking wave
moonlight sliding
over the sand

autumn wind
falling from the tree
yesterday's rain

winter stream
a leaf spinning
in the bubbles

children play
in the broken boat
of the rice field

by the pond
the uneven shadows
of the turtles

alongside the stream
the poplars hang headlong
into the sky

a school of fish
scatters suddenly
a cloud in the summer night

a snowy plain
lit by moonlight
a long whistle of a train

at the window
my anger ceases
blossoming chestnut

moonlight
the river divides the forest
into two nights

cawing crows
i pull my head
deeper into the jacket

after the bombing
the remains of the bridge
joined by the fog

autumn mist
only the train's whistle
arrives at the third platform

nightingale song
looking for a way home
that no longer exists

summer shower
intensifies the thud
of sheep legs

discarded shoe
slowly filled by snow
a white foot

cut down forest
behind a deer's antlers
waxing moon

unexploded yellow
cluster bomb
dandelion field

odors of spring
a young bull's horns
sharpened by the moon

air-raid alarm
the traffic lights
change for no one

falling leaf
its place filled by a star

spring sky
at the moment of explosion
not a single star

blind track
along the rusty rails
time travels

garden work
talking to each other
back to back

dark clouds
feather collectors
run loaded

subway
the staircase raises us
toward the rainy sky

first buds
swayed by the trains
according to the schedule

a cannon barrel
evaporating spring rain

funeral
faces of wet people
lit by lightning

fleeing the war
through a hole in my shoe
autumn rain

spring moon
deeper into the night
to the very cold

this house visited
by my thoughts
a quince blossom falls

a cracked shell
razed by the fruit
of a wild chestnut

a parcel from afar
cedar cones and a few
pencil-written lines

at dawn the soul-scratching
of janitors' shovels
stops

the drawing on the cup
almost erased
with your lips

frosty you told me
a big cloud i'll answer with
a small one

thaw drip
little girls on the bench
swing their legs

sparrows get loud
just about time
to smell hot pancakes

sunny spring day
the retriever brings me a stick
thrown by someone else

the sun is higher
a fisherman brushes
the scale from his hand

notebooks with poems
i tear them joyfully
for paper ships

april
a typo in every line
of a young typist

spring street noises
in the empty classroom
a music teacher

end of may
the wardrobe door
creaks again

how the maple has grown
unwittingly i touch
the bristles on my cheeks

even from the gutter
even beaten and drunk
i still admire the moon

fried herring's smell
in the vietnamese dorm
what a long evening

i walk for water
and chamomile heads beat
the bottom of my bucket

cloudy piece by piece
my mind gathers
a full moon

a bird cry outside
i turn my back
on drunken buddies

summer rain
acronyms blacken
on the bannister

old swing
so easily to childhood
and back

i too am not local
planting a sprouted acorn
by a palm tree

phone book
removing the dead
geranium leaves

cranes flying south
one dress from the drying rope
has disappeared

leaves fallen
but flowers now seen
in the opposite house

the sun is gone
an old lady walks
to a different bench

gloomy morning
the sock is darned
with motley threads

two pine trees
greet each other
with a squirrel's jump

thick snow filling
a gap in the fence
with silence

bitter cold pulling
itself from the street
an endless cat

heavy snowfall
three snowmen in the park
and one glass

minus twenty
in my voice
father's tones

raven flying
precise calligraphies
through red leaves

we stopped on the bridge
the time and the water flowing
quiet under us

house for sale
the apricot tree in bloom
as never before

emptiness of autumn
in the guitar bursts
another string

a new sound
from an old instrument
spring thaw

on the frozen window
the cat scratches the moon
late evening

workers waiting
over the boundary
pass hundreds of cranes

through the breach
of the rusty can
the red poppy

near the old wind mill
a cricket grinding
the stillness

broken frame
the blue river
remains in the picture

the night between years
i opened a full bottle
of new illusions

horses to the wagon
the colt is coming after
following the footsteps

news from afar
in the mail box
cherry blossoms

listening to the flight
of a thousand white paper cranes
a blind war veteran

the small pagoda
making the hill taller
the evening coolness

sea roaring
covers the town
storm at the distance

over the old pond
the leaf trembles on the branch
another moment

moonless night
and an owl's cry
from nowhere

jogging on the alleys
a girl and a dog
jumping over petals

wedding night
two hedgehogs are crushed
on the smooth highway

the silence of night
in the courtyard puddle
a chestnut and a star

and birds crying
when they will know to sing
i will be far away

blooming cockleburs
at my parents house
no one waiting for me

a storm
the dandelion remained
only memory

before me
in my parents' old house
a leaf comes in

sunlit streets
other shadows
walk in pairs

from the bamboo pipe
a dragon fly is drinking
the kabuki show

many presents
beside christmas tree
missing grandfather

flying nowhere
black birds appearing
out of the painter's brush

long after the song
of the first bird is over
swaying cherry twig

a supernova exploding
in universe a cricket
in the threshold

yellowing trees
along the river dambovita
sun at sunset

knock on the door
from this and other side
question marks

holding a thread of gossamer
distant sound of a train

childhood blanket
now i wrap in it
my mother's chill

grandmother
she recognizes us
by touch

cherry trees in bloom
if only i could stop
the wind

foggy evening
the old boat sinks
in the silence

cherry blossoms
i miss the orchard
of my father

an old apple tree
memories
instead of fruits

wind chimes
the first drops of rain
change their sound

first snow tracks
of a homeless man
from sill to sill

quiet morning
sky and sleepy ducks
flow under the bridge

buddha statue
my smiling wife
looks at her belly

petition for divorce
the period
in every sentence

hospital window
day by day there are fewer
leaves on the trees

morning fog
all plans in one
cup of coffee

forest by the lake
fish hide behind
the trees

end of summer
the wind erasing
footprints

whiteness
the water falls
into its sound

old garden
from tree to tree
my childhood

fog
the world ends
in the garden

snowflakes
the painter adds
white to white

broken mirror
in each piece
the same eyes

mountains reflection
i turn the trail map
upside down

restless reeds
a swan at the shore
shuns my shadow

winter field
the crows devour
the last light

little trout
warming in the shallows
i cool my feet

no stars
only snowflakes
in the lantern light

twilight
the shadows
overshadowed

old piano
from every key
the same silence

in atomic rain
buddha goes on smiling
at the last butterfly

ashes in the air
a bud opens
in the gray plant

deep inside you
no more war

the first crocus
and even an old heart
beats faster

on a late spring day
the waters are wrinkling
with wings skimming over

limitless blue sky
knocking the heaven gate
from a spacecraft can i meet an alien

silence
wings of butterflies
grazing grass

spring water
and silence travels
to the sea

this deep hole
my daughter's small hand
lifts me out

glittering the voices
of white cranes
erasing our memories

a mirage becomes
one of many
escaped horses

on that trunk i sat
seeing a bird in a trap
i can not save it

drunk for the first time
the horizon is in my feet

here in the airport
between here and there
nothing is mine

old age is freedom
the house key gets lost
you're dwelling in chaos

butterfly's wings
dust rearranges itself
in a mosaic

ultrasound scan
i rearrange my dreams

diamond hills
diamond lake
diamond trap

silent jellyfish
towards the surface of its skin
the deep dark cold fjord

dreaming a mirage
the skyscrapers of new york
are as they always were

spring evening
distant stars radiate
the light of memory

november's moon
childhood so far away
and my sister dead

bach
and more air
in the chest

farewell to the sea
watercolors in the bag
of my heart

secret mass grave
almost audible voices
from above

sick in bed
the gap between
the curtains

under the burning sun
earthworms die
my words

the transitory life
just as a paper windmill
blown by the wind

when this cloud goes away
i am a wave
in the late autumn

without a farmhouse
near each star

the milky way
putting three dots
at the very beginning

one-way street
magnolia flowers facing
the opposite direction

green acorns
the stamp
of an old ewe

late spring gusts
the howl of a wicket
appeal from the local ground

early morning run
her hair swings side to side
fired by the sun

drowsy afternoon
a duck's eyelid
slides up

camping ground
the cries of other people's
children

rock tuatara
the sun catches a pulse
in its throat

dry summer
the kale-field shimmering
with white butterflies

midnight
my lungs widen
with stars

summer ends
counting the dents
in my cricket bat

end of summer
scarlet stamens
in the folds of my tent

raindrops
and the sound of a shoe
being unlaced

wet morning
the girl holds back her hair
with her ears

a pause in our conversation
golden gingko

constant rain
i can smell the gray
of my horse

mountain frost
the rise and fall
of a pebble

snowflake
my breath
takes it away

his final illness
the shiny corridor
to the exit

health centre aquarium
at the bottom
a dead goldfish

behind the window
of the genocide museum
i see my reflection

mountain shrine
leaving an offering
of paua shell

a handful would suffice
mountain stars

moving again
three boxes
labelled driftwood etc

bus ride
her pigtail hangs
in my notes

unlocking
the gun cupboard
the wild in the dog's eyes

the frost
my father's empty house
waits by the road

they did not notice
a couple in love on the road
those large raindrops

smoky furrow
neither plow nor plowman
where are you my father

a sea shell pearl
remembering murmur
of home waves

there are no cranes at all
yet every autumn their calls
fly above me

a falling leaf
whispers a sad song
to summer gone by

a windy night
a tiny bit of someone's skirt
peers behind the newsstand

in the shallows
boys blur the sky
and clear water

withered leaf of an oak tree
has fallen on grandfather's shade
in the bottom of the yard

a fig leaf fell
into my lap
adam where are you

a deserted nest
the birch leaves
moved into it

scarcely visible
a firefly lights my path
it too is a hope

a moribund hut
the smoke prolongs its life

on a mountain road
somehow it hits my heart
a wild violet

once i arrived
at the cemetery entrance door
i remembered the flowers

bouncing toad
still enough room
for a full moon

the screeching of brakes
scattered on the asphalt
red apples

the thunderbolt
murky clouds knitting
a veil of the sky

pink flowers
from my neighbor's balcony
wave to the dawn

flower after flower
the rainbow of ikebana
arranging its colors

she is smiling
peach juice leaking
down her breasts

with a broom
a nun chases the autumn
around the monastery

tara in autumn
another tear flows
to distances

i share with blackbird
japanese apple
everyone pick on its own side

birds fly away
they leave their nests
and nostalgia

umbrellas rocking the raindrops
a dog slogs through the mud calmly

every wave brings
a bundle of happiness
to the shore

women washing laundry
the warm river flows away
the color of white linen

alone in front of the house
my shadow wiped away
by the setting moon

room on the roof
the echo of dogs
in the backyards

on the blue sea
like dead whales
two black rocks

the black sapote makes me think
that i am eating in the daytime
and in pieces the night

traffic sign
the fallen leaves move
in the opposite direction

war drum
the fertile half moon
a basin of blood

the tiny magnifying glass
the butterfly needs
to observe the flower

the sapodilla falls
frightened the thrushes
flee and cry out

in spring
all dreams open
like flowers

on the cement
the bee swigs
from the jacaranda flower

fallen leaves
and cigarette butts
have gathered in the potholes

the rain stops
a stray dog
shakes itself off

one walker
following buddha's steps
in a lotus flower

the panther's skin
was upholstered
with new moons

the earwig
how many hours
captive in this bowl

a nomadic cloud
always forgets its drops
on my window

day of gold
the lariat closes its question mark
around the bull's horns

the prickly pear
and the porcupine
cross stabbing looks

tender willow
almost gold almost amber
almost light

in the smooth curve of hills
dark flesh undulates

pelican porcelain
coffee pot floating
on the water

light skin of cloud
where a splinter of moon
is impaled

sometimes i feel
the need to cry
but the sea does it for me

you will cry soon
the sky already becomes small
in your eyes

if man is dust
those that wander across
the plain are men

the falling leaf dreams it is
for an instant
a wing and a wave

sunflower even when
torn from its stem
still attends to the sun's course

like a black cat
the night awakens itself
little by little

torrential rain
afterwards
the green skin of the frog

house without doors
dead leaves
rain on the roof

at water's edge
supple reeds
trap these words

in a vase
the mountain magnolia
blossoms

deep in the mountains
the way of the birds
often sunlit

may wind
behind the tombstone
no shadow

birds
lately without a sound
have come

wind off the sea
the thew of the mountain
grows great

seeing you off
into the deep autumn
ether fading away

my cough
runs away from me
and into the woods

just here
if there's a bit of sun
drying socks

what are they saying?
pushing the wagon
together

the sound of water
here at the house
my sister has married into

a cold wind whelms me
so beautiful

tears
while he sits and talks
mother listening

almost talking
it burns bright a moment
and disappears

someone passes by
through sharp shadows
through strong sunlight

sleeping children
beneath blankets
the sound of waves

a light on
in the house
and a stream flows by

july
but out of the rain
the autumn wind

in the fog
two sad hearts
dissolve into one

flitting away
into the blue morning
floating seagull

cry of a water bird
the water's moon
the water's stars

a winter crow
pushes off from the snow
with his belly

every day the trees shed more
as i look up
as i pass through

one insect
without the others
then the others

a cat
on a scattered beach
noon

just moved here
and living in loneliness
someone else's flowers

lunchtime
after the children
children's voices

a sick man
at the hospital
shadows of thin trees

moonlit clouds
coldly spreading out
across the moor

touching the door
a quiet sound
like snow

two butterflies
one of them turns me
around and around

after flurries
in the nonchalant sky
the sunrise

seedling grass
my heart has become
honest

mackerel sky
remembering the times
since then

i've come from afar
but the funeral prayer
i saw was not deep

coughing up blood
the faces of my family
so vivid

the path
of fallen leaves ends here
hillside grave

deep forest
the sound of rain
like fallen leaves

mountain mist over the dam
flowers eddy

candle flame
looking at your face
during the autumn gale

winter waves
their sound is sharp
at the hotel

during the evening of the rainy season
the sound of the stream
homeyness

the northern sea
with its dark waves
cherry blossom festival

an iron bridge
the winter haze
beneath it thins out

over the rocks
the winter river's sound
goes by

rapt
the look of the man
sowing wheat

mountain shrine
a distant moon over the nets
for catching thrush

an example
to those of us
poor at heart

scorching heat
the money not forthcoming
i drop my bag

stone lanterns
in the cold moonlight
a fruit orchard

searching for warmth
with their noses
wild horses

on the machines
as well the moon
everyone gone

the lights already on
children returning
across the horizon

first butterfly
so giddy with life
we can't calm down

i am here
the cockscombs there
the space between

radish in hand
the farmer's wife
in worn sandals

dreamily i raise my leeks
loneliness

under the maiden's
lonely protection
silkworms sleep

blazing heat
the unhappy waif's
small shadow

clouds at noon
the peony in the garden
deeply white

winter koi
from beyond the hill garden
the sound of a koto

cut flower
i walk into the dawn
barefoot

such a joy
while washing my feet
just a couple of words

carrying down wood
from the cold evening mountains
the call of a shrike

the clatter of hail
the clatter of a teletype
night through the window

sleeping on a boat
far from the bamboos of home
the milky way

night blossoms
burnt with other things
they are colorless

drooping wisteria
and the rain won't fall
from the low sky

far-off frogs
feeling a bit wearier
each passing day

tranquil pines
they are intermingling
the waterbirds

new year's day
while washing my hands
the feel of the night

driftwood shining
on this fine day
winter sea

twittering
the piano wears
a fine dust

wheat
realizing death
as one color gold

counting down
the goodness of man
from the sixth obscure

deep winter
within the pillar
the rushing of waves

cherry blossoms fall
you too must become
a hippo

tugging a wailing man
just to the riverbank
edge of this world

since the burned ground
forever run in dreams

loosing
rock-paper-scissors
born as a firefly

a classroom party
tomorrow i'll go
shoot a bear

however rain
however dark green
falls on bamboo

drowsiness
out of reach of blue river
in the spring

the awkward lie
of an eldest daughter
carnation flower

after the tsunami disaster
an old woman lives
apart from death

shadow on the window
of a late autumn dragonfly
once in a while

spring day
from the peacock's feathers
light

in the water
the fish are still
autumn wind

in winter
rain stops and starts
the darkness

a bright day
like myself
falling leaves

the storyteller
has finished his tale
the long night

a wife to lean on
i've decided against
autumn evening

rain starts and stops
wind starts and stops
the quiet night

may rains
where i go to leak
the roof does too

near the ocean
a millet field
in the summer sun

in the evening sky
the treetops all line up
second spring

a beggar loiters
by the temple gate
falling willow leaves

in a stone hollow
guarded by a maple
water gathers

sucking on seaweed
i wonder if i'm real
or just an actor

above the bay where
the stakes are being driven
their sound

a black
cloud hangs over them
cherry blossoms

a whole day
without speaking
butterfly silhouettes

the black iron
windbell of autumn
as it happens

evening cherry blossoms
gazing back toward them
they recede

spring rumble
somewhere in the distance
a skylark

winter mountains
where the roads meet
the one flat spot

spring ends
in a garden without cherry blossoms
fallen leaves

my home so far away
tree buds

this road
other than that
it's all his

at my house
i own a rice bowl
going home

first to the ear
from returning home
becomes the flow

a flock of gulls
makes for the woods
coping

just now cutting
down a tree
how still as i look up

hanging there
a wild boar
before snow

like feathers dividing
a flying beetle
jumps off

frigid water
green hills
day darkener

katsuragi mountain
and lying in its' bosom
the buddha

as with courage
so it is with salt
the white of new plum

at the crossroads
as it is everywhere
autumn evening

cold crow
onto its shadow
it descends

the sound of rain
bitten into by their cries
the insect cage

the night clerk
how stupid his having
a child bride

mending socks
i am no nora
teacher's wife

short night
this one without milk
throw it away

a farewell
an equinox flower
blooming barely

autumn wind
a stone-laden horse
doesn't move

broken clouds
as soon as i leave the house
i think of home

scudding scudding
until the lungs feel blue
ocean travel

roof garden
cherry blossoms against the sky
round to the horizon

mountain fire
the dusty coal mine
with fog above

shop window
on the cheap paper
winter sunbeams

a firefly's light
the flower left behind
still swayed

a cricket cries
just once
suddenly my life

sweet grapes
quiet at his death
my anger

red lilies
so the railroad guard
is black

i've become a teacher
and hold within me
a cough

a period of drinking
then returning quietly
to the milky way

wakened at noon
the scissors-grinder
passes by

my friend is free
tears today
at the high wild geese

into the sunset
into the sunset
a red army

broken ones
unbroken ones
summer butterflies

plum blossom scent
rises up
halo of the moon

mosquito larvae
the sunshine
on stagnant water

in the market stones
on the woodblock prints
spring breeze

loneliness
the height of the temple's ceiling
through the mosquito net

beginning of autumn
in the drifting clouds
the wind

dawn
the call of whales
from beneath the sea

departing autumn
the grasses hide
a stream's flow

oh the straw raincoat
is still green
winter rain

praying for rain
bonfire flames ripple
the cloud peak

a traveler drops
in some coins
the clear water

a dog's bark
a man passes
in the snowy night

spring to spring
feeling the same
and different

in the mountains
autumn briefly
and the setting sun

in the doorway
a man's shadow
autumn evening

autumn moon
a water's glaze
to the rooftiles

using a candle
to light my cigar
hototogisu

the quiet
the cherry blossoms
unmoved by the temple bell

the mountain clear
through the rain
autumn's water

approaching them each
with their moon
the pines

a foggy sea
a rising sun
that's it

passing easily
through thinning willows
autumn sun

a waterbird beak
in its feathers
falls asleep

the temple bell
heard from the great house
spring evening

opening the door
o toss out used tea leaves
a skurry of snow

over withered reeds
snowflakes flicker
after wind

overnight on the line
drying my underwear
the milky way

the path narrows
where we linger
a leek field

folks sleeping
nothing between
me and the moon

falling blossoms
nd the calming down
of us all

this one and that one
must still have a name
burning grasses

a paulonia
rains runs down its bark
beneath the cicada

dragonflies all going
the same way
sunset

the willow brushes
morning dewdrops from the grass
along the path

cold wind
through the torn shoji
october moon

cherry blossoms scattering
an evening in prayer

bursting at the seams
weeping cherries
in bloom

like dutch letters
geese flying
across the sky

well well
was all i could say
cherries of yoshino

pampas grass
takes the form
of the autumn wind

its body
ends in emptiness
cicada

gazing up
at the great sky
scent of plum blossoms

spring rain
the willows first
make us drowsy

snow reveals
the broken form
of an umbrella

summer evening
the smoke planes
mosquito columns

hamlets bereft
of blossoms and the sea
tonight's moon

new maple leaves
once again sunlit
after the shower

blowing away
all of the clouds
a newly-leafed tree

winter wind
it ends in the roar
of the sea

to know the plum
a heart
a nose

autumn
old age is in the birds
the clouds

wolves howl
all at once
evening snow

nameless
but each weed
its flower

marking the places
to apply the mugwort
cool spring wind

winter gale
a lone bird
looks cold

just their voices
passing in the dark
the cold

smoky candle
the evening
cold with snow

morning glories
sharing a row
bloom and wither

a nightingale
my sandals stuck
in field mud

violets
the geisha will want
to view the fields

evening glories
i lie in my room
in my autumn

morning glory
so white
the dew disappears

the whole
broad leaf lit up
firefly

rainy day
a stranger passes by
with flowers

banana leaves
what will you do
autumn wind

from the high bank
bulbuls are singing
puffy clouds

felling the hedge
the young bamboo
becomes the hedge

the day moon gone
plovers against the sky

skylark
almost a match
or the spring wind

new leaves
of course i'm sleepy
this spring morning

the sickly child
makes an appearance
barley autumn

trudging trudging
when i fall let me lie
in this field of bush clover

until they blossom
who notices
azaleas

warehouse burnt
nothing left to impede
the view of the moon

the evening star
departs behind the mountain
voice of the deer

storm over
the coolness left
in the bamboos

a cicada cries out
once the moonlit night

first snow
a rock just above
the waves

in the straw
lining the stable
firefly

grasshopper cheeping
in the scarecrow's sleeve

snowy morning
the sandals leave behind
their two and two

the dog barks
at the roar of leaves
the storm

with my whole heart
pressing her to my skin
sleet

barley heads
they reel with the butterflies
in the wind

all the way to ise
we have been fellow travelers
wild geese

the footprints of a man
first cherry blossoms

harvest moon
crossing tatami
the shadow of a pine

harvest moon
where darkness lurks
insect cries

spring breeze
the barley fields
sound of water

plum blossoms
traces of spring
nowhere else

two or three
visible stars
croaking frogs

slant sunrays
on the temple bell
scant heat

so much dancing
in kyoto
so many women

around the fire
the assembled knees
so thin

paulonia seeds
blown this way and that
winter storm

above the horizon
people scattered
shell gathering

largo three crickets
and a midsummer night
becomes bigger

delicate makeup of silk
in reflections of far distances
all simple thought is near

the first wine
is a warm foam that i taste
on your tongue

autumn evening
on the muddy road
we part

morning i shine
with immensity

pine cones on the table
spring once was alive

downpour
the statue of the hero
does not budge

snowflakes
from the horses breath
drifting apart

there's loneliness
in a forest of tombs
cicadas

out of season
the hedge is in bloom
hoar frost

crawling in the grass
the small green lizard
he feels like a dragon

among the rubble
on their frightened faces
infinite self-respect

in the middle of the night
on the glass rim
her lipstick

ebb tide
the wet sand becomes again
a clean slate

lazy heat
from my cupped hands
i drink the moon

writing poems
the rain roar
and no children

bare branches
this sudden need
to stroke your hair

under the plane tree
we sit and talk
growing shadows

little girl running
crackling of dry leaves
along the walkway

sleepless night
the sound of petals
in the courtyard

bonfire
my shadow dances
unbeknownst to me

crane beak
long water snake
hanging full of river

pond in the evening
a duck passes through
the full moon

your absence
the cherry blossoms
still bloom

muggy day
among the office papers
an origami

withering wind
whitens the bones
of a sycamore

windshield wipers
what was i thinking
windshield wipers

forty years later
he same music
shooting stars

the first drops of rain
striking the limestone shelter
color again

down below
singing to the darkness
great whales

a thousand-page book
i will surely never read
the first narcissus

turning tide
a barnacle waits
on a limpet

a blackbird's sweet song
lost in the wilderness of hills
prayer for the dead

everywhere
even in my pocket
this morning's spring wind

dangerous pavements
but this year i face the ice
with my father's stick

corn-crake
a cry in the wilderness
of meadow

bowed heads heavy
after daffodils spelling
the spring

house deserted
rhubarb stumps
in the back garden

inside the empty shell
snail's dreams

ancient earthworks
a raven echoes
vanished war cries

i shut the history book
and the shooting stops

dark wintry sky
geese wedge their way
into the wind

after the storm
fog off the sea curling
into snail shells

enfolding the fallen foxglove
a slug's soft dream

in spring
the cry of a cuckoo
someone else's dream

low tide
the driftwood rests

damp meadowsweet
horses in mist
up to their oxters

light almost gone
through a swarm of midges
first star

hot sun after rain
wet statue of the virgin
slightly steams

between pre-natal
and mortuary
the research unit

bunch of weeds
in a famine graveyard
evening mist settles

november sunset
a galaxy of crows
quench the twilight

winter fog
over the river
moving with it

sun-touched gully
the wool and bones
of a passing winter

there must be light
where they came from
chestnut blossoms

daffodils rot
in the vase
their shadows bloom

pauper's graveyard
only the long grasses
have names

among the wheat fields
a woman sits
head on her knees
lamenting

who assigned
the green berry leaves
as silkworm nurture

no one but a woman
by the grave
a butterfly

no lonely tree
when a butterfly sits
on a leaf

night passed
as the dead soldier's wrap
through the worn window

deep sunset
destined to loneliness
a barren tree

spring mist
a raging flood
for ants

sunrise
my marvel of peru blooms
at sunset

this new year
i paint my room walls
your eye color

at night again
counting the watermelons
idle scarecrow

so many robins
that i have frightened
you sprout

descending the mountain
me and my shadow

mountain dusk
a distant town's lights
turn on

in braille
kisses as you
close your eyes

buddha's orange cloak
how luminous it glitters
under the moon light

where does it go
the passing by breeze
first day of spring?

empty graves
filled by the rain
this first day of spring

petunia scent
through the neighbor's terrace
sulky with me

blooming trees
deep in the winter
a robin

she is neither by the sea
nor the sea by her
she's just a poet

snow covered peak
beyond the invisible village
orangish red

autumn night
how glister the teeth
of the stray dog

first day of school
singing for my daughter
while driving

evening hail
remember one by one
my own sins

in the moonlight
stepping on the footprints
gone to the sea

yard gardenia
for the master and servant
equally its scent

holiday morning
outside the window
the chicken-seller's call

on a dried log
the rain has grown
green moss

bitter cold
wooden deities burn
for the sake of life

i open the leaf
that holds my meal
mother's fragrance

sandstorm
searching for an address
among skyscrapers

exhausted
at the end of road
your house

rain-washed moon
the lizard's balanced walk
towards an insect

raindrops spreading
through the veranda
the scent of basmati

scentless
in the diary
dry flowers

lights flash
they discover
i'm alone

relocation
a tulasi plant
on the gypsy's head

still water
a zebra runs away
from itself

rumors of war
up into a darkening sky
a child's newsprint kite

drifting stars
a wish list flutters
in the breeze

monsoon sky
the white cow chews
a milk carton

dense fog
i dream walk
my sense of i

deafening rain
to think it has no sound
of its own

on a long way with me
in the dark night
these fireflies

plucking
the last red apple
now i feel the cold

spring solitude
an alien girl
feeds the sparrows

scars
that have begun to heal
purple asters

temple bell
thinking of god
in the midst of yoga

lonely road
she walks with me
wagging her tail

bustling street
from a graveyard
the smell of roses

ink puddle
the words
that never were

starry night
a soft feeling in my hand
of numberless sands

spring winds
the cats try again
to tidy their fur

windy morning
dry leaves fall
between our conversation

bright sunlight
a shadow beside
the shadow of a friend

on this wintry canvas
i regard my own breath
as a white phantom

your satori is late see
decades of years
faded away in vain

the heaped bed of snow
is spinning away in flames
dream of the wheat seed

from the children's hands
the snow-white paper pieces
fall into powder

seventeen syllables
marinate it a little
a small philosophy

someone in the night
has been biting into
the nose of the snowman

holy emptiness
jesus is sleeping
in the shadow of buddha

in the washing bin
the dishes are piled up
as our empty years

in our letter-box
a pair of tits is dwelling
careful with that letter!

from finger-end to stove
falls a drop of water
hisses and disappears

new year's morning
the thrown-away paper trumpet
spits blood to the snow

museum garden
an ever-moving small man
comforts the stone sculptures

what has been assured to me
i accept with peace
the road's difficult

so many blood drops
rose hips are going to
red summer passes away

ancient tombstones
the illegible names
are of very young soldiers

nudist beach
adam and eve exchange
e-mail addresses

meadow flowers
so many times trampled
now grow earthward

in front of my feet
sat a bird and then took flight
now i'm heavier

behind an old hut
i drink from the well
of the past

behind the curtain
purulence flows from the dream
into a big bowl

in the beggar's hand
my grandfather's sooty face
a piece of black bread

in the sweet spring sky
the light of shining venus
shadows jupiter

end of the millennium
instead of progress
the hangman tends to us

i am writing lines
over and over and pray
for immortality

my dream a secret star
which helps me fly away
to my passed mother

sometimes in our dreams
the blooming trees are chatting
to you liberty!

already half past two
how quickly
a year has passed

on the monitor
the lively sine-wave becomes
a horizontal line

merry christmas
the twentieth century's napkins
are hanging on bars

eights spots
this is the dream
of the ladybird

there in the west
how many purple memories
of attica linger

she had no eyes
the snakes she held
ate her hands away

gone for years
the poplar he planted
is full of birds

the cyclamen
embraced by snow
is slowly dying

a diamond cuts
the extreme stillness
the first nightingale

and i always forgive
since there are sea-gulls
and cyclamens

i love you this way
all misty from the rain
in your eyes

you sad hands
hide your lonesomeness
in your pocket

tree foliage
my hands are cicadas
in your hair

at all heights
only your hands
have stronger wings

stone trees
and a bronze bird
on every branch

since you're absent
summer reminds of autumn

crazy bird of spring
chirping verses

to bad or good
a great harvest opens
on the stars

blurred crystals
make things look smaller
and make me feel like a god

nocturnal fog
is falling onto your body
i light up shadows

writing a letter
he stood awhile
to see the full moon

sunday morning
it is as if someone else
entered my new garment

the spring hail
is washing away
the dust of the road

the lark
sings with us
mimicking us

a sparrow
in the mouth of the statue
counts the hours

in the streets
i saw unborn people
judging us

like an unexpected leafage
your tongue encircles me

at noon
you have been caught
on a small cloud

the psychologist
was very clear
i leave my nails to grow

we are forgotten
the sea constantly narrows
and we run wild

gray clouds hover
over my soul's island
it'll rain again

it's just fine like this
with eyes pulled out
you see internally

a congested
disorderly wind
turns up

on long stilts hurriedly
my shadow over the field
december sun

abandoned lighthouse
behind the panes
the salty moon

lonely mountains
i answer the echo
of somebody else

visiting hour
between the lips
safety glass

space
my jeans
too tight

to the war memorial
over crumbling steps
rattling oak leaves

thereafter
in the skylight
another sky

overnight
the ice has turned
the stream up

bus stop
the warmth at my back
alights

the waitress
gives the blind man
a special smile

music somewhere
the old quadrille stallion
twitches his ears

leaves floating
in the sunset light
how hard to be so light

april shower
in the hall of the employment office
silence reigns

returning home at night
from the fur of my cat
the smell of winter

found
in old photos
her smile

fading light
today she knew
who i am

in my parents' house
the stairs still creaking
in the same place

doctor's waiting room
the buddha statue has been sitting here
for three years now

parting
two clouds of breath
become one

winter evening
with tiny stitches
the doll's smile returns

november morning
ringing bells go about
lifting the fog

morning cool
the archer draws
the silence

father's video
the wedding vow
blurred

on the carousel
each time around
closer to childhood

moonlight
the empty chair
has stopped rocking

sunday afternoon
a concert of coffee spoons
from the balconies

shopping mile
the empty space
around the beggar

midday heat
the shadow of the shepherd
grazed

polished varnish
the vendor's smile
in the showroom kitchen

closing time
the day disappears
in the night safe

to love till drawing blood
how to reciprocate
with the eager mosquito

sunflower seeds
titmouse on the sill
autumn morning

the green lizard stares at me
sticking out its tongue
then becomes grass again

a lone ideogram
of which i understand nothing
opens a secret asia

infinitely beautiful
the slender grasses
i laid my scythe

you were just fifteen
oh to taste that spring
of the promising cherries

what he remembers
of his first time with a girl
la petite mord

ten crows outside
yet i have not burned
my old manuscripts

steaming bowl of tea
i look and i sip
light flavor of time

a hoopoe flies up
from below the bracken
a breath of fresh air

dancing elbow to elbow
the hard disk
of all that we are

work on the page ink white erasures
copy words quick quick
go and pee

this rainbow
forgotten here
in the autumn evening

under the blooming cherry tree
even the maiden does not venture

sunday tube-station
flowers under plastic
and market products

they stand in my way
the lovers kissing
in the middle of the bridge

on the ground
of the world trade center
the shadows of nearby towers

under a sky too gray
to see a heron fly past
winter stretches

rays of sunshine
held fast in a spider's web
end of the season

medlars
looks like frost
five syllables inside

undressed woman
with a more tactful hand
a billsticker

how are the children he asks
leaving the cemetery

behind a fence
the garden on a leash
dreams of america

on the frozen ground
a hen hesitates before putting down
the other foot

christmas night
the wind waves a white bag
by the roadside

subway crowd
on this navy blue coat
a gray hair

light on silver birch
like a sparrow lost
in cuckoo flowers i cry

while washing the dishes
suddenly i think of my wife
who is bra-less

the air is full of gifts
will you turn into the patient
sample chart of the skies

lying eyes wide open
back slightly sore
what do the newspapers say

mill wall
the brick
with my name

a periscope planet
navigates the night
deepest slumber

locked into slots
at the village school
a line of colorful scooters

into the stillness
of the winter depths
all the spent lives

helicopter crash
the human chain
edges in

wind on the fell
clinging to the river bank
a row of alders

cenotaph a plane tree
leaf falling
on a muffled drum

bass-string harmonic
a bluebottle glancing
off the windowpane

the vicar unfolds
his wedding umbrella
cherry blossom rain

wild child
wild cyclamen grows
around her grave

blood-crazed
a mosquito carries
my life away

ice-tipped furze
a sea wind brings goldcrests
on their own wings

a last cigarette
gazing at the yellowed star
that's really venus

summer wind
two old ladies
prop each other up

just me being trimmed
i ask if they're busy

passing unmarked
another wave
on the shore

snow in the air
my bones argue
among themselves

when the wind drops
over whalebone marsh
harmonized bleats

intimate with demons
i embrace the night

women's clinic
the sisterhood of
identical cotton gowns

wayside yawn
a pinch of lavender
clears the head

october sun
a ladybird restlessly probes
the window's edge

over the wal
of the private club
a tennis ball escapes

first nativity
only one puffin twirls
in the dance

between flickers
of recognition
shadow play

whips of wind
the mole catcher's coat
flaps with the crows

string quartet
a small spider's legs flex
with all their might

trying to make sense of it
geometric patterns
in the carpet

from the train
through thick fog
a drift of birds
on the wing

morning sun
beating against the hearth
rug a clouded yellow

a sleepless night
ashamed of my idle dreams
full of desires

ideas are swarming
like life in a primeval sea
find their slow way up

pear blossoms falling
the nightingale's complaint
insomnia

my lips on your skin
tasting yesterday's dinner
my ginger girlfriend

fluffy dancer
seeds the thistledown
company is ready to float

a bouquet of flowers
white for innocence
red for love

the white dove flies
over the battlefield
shitting on the war

eggs hatching in may
ducklings peeping in the nest
mother fox looming

world covered in snow
white as my unused papers
who is the writer

through faded curtains
veiled sunbeams in the rain
a glint of summer

again and again
the dog swims after the stick
its owner happy

sitting waiting
forgotten whom to meet
trees stand naked

landscapes of the shore
slow stories of the stones
response for the moment

the withered leaves
rustle under my feet
the shadow moves silently

a word that takes time
defoliation

along the railroad
the tall slender goldenrods
in the sunshine rain

the singing sea tempting
calling us out
on deep water

falling to the ground
they never really see it
the tree within me

the wind wraps itself
in her silk coat
endlessly

snowflakes dancing
over the bare graves
the sky is open

the black sound of storm
in the late astonished evening
after the meltdown

in a special mood
during tropical rainstorm
eye of the typhoon

a hedgehog in your
garden full of flowers
life is wonderful!

on the field for the cows
blooming clover i see
the cows only as stones

the full moon circle
strikes me with yet another
tide of gravity

the first summer warmth
the coot disappears under
the butterbur leaves

the storm is over
our shipwrecked hearts
remain next to each other

waiting time
a parenthesis that grows
a world away of wonder

the ugly duckling
flying all around the world
while the swan stays here

summer is maturing
in the shade of the figtree
annual rings grow

blossoming lavender
yet another sky
under the sky

pregnant woman embroidering
swaying field of heavy ears

even before the first flakes
fragrance of snow in the air

summer hush
the figs are filled
with sugar

melted snow
seeing off winter
down the river

the snow falls relentlessly
over the corpse

long dawning
a cabbage neck
motionless in the snow

on the steep slope
a salamander slipped
on a dry leaf

in shallow water
a fish moved
into an empty box

a boy
he is hiding winter
in his pockets

dead in the fish trap
the blueness
in the fish's eye

after the rain
heavy and sunk in the mud
every snail

in a puddle
a boy has discovered
a sea of his own

mutual understanding
a tramp and scarecrow
exchange hats

at sunset
a cricket's song
turns on the night

the heavenly path
disappears on the horizon
migration of birds

my gaze follows
the flight of swallows
taking the summer away

a leather jacket
all drenched with rain
the scent of autumn

the sunset
between two hills
a horse and the plowman

with a mulberry bough
burning in the fireplace
my mother's life

the picked flowers
in various colors
equally sad

in a moment
the fog swallowed
the church

so gracefully
comets have dived
in the blue depths

a mad south wind
it's raining the sea
became the sea

meadow flowers
pollen is spread
by a barefoot girl

searching for asparagus
in the hill i run
into the violets

in a cold room
a forgotten soldier takes off
his mechanical limbs

a frog
lifts the pond
on its legs

the sleet the snowflakes
no longer care for the game

all night
fragrance of the acacia
feeds the homeless

from reed to reed
a blackbird follows
its song

leaving
my loneliness
inside her

slowly together
on the unmade bed
willow shadows

both with our feet
in this freezing river
our eyes touch

endless scales
on the neighbor's flute
my mother's ironing

in every puddle
the after storm sky
reflecting all the quiet

november nightfall
the shadow of the headstone
longer than the grave

in moon light
a brown pine needle spinning
above the ferns

picking berries
i happen on a bear print
in the slocan mountains

my heart awaiting you
silence still and the vast
falling of leaves

the fog has settled
around us a faint redness
where the maple was

dawn
suddenly nude
the lake shivers

we part
the moon follows
us both

wild pears
yellow jackets push
under the skin

a length of rope
knotted with seaweed
pull of the tide

the heron
striking its own reflection
shallow water

in the fog
a dog noses maple leaves
winter election

moss-hung trees
a deer moves
into the hunter's silence

dawn stars still twinkling
the whiteness of daisies

northern lights
just beyond the reach
of my walking stick

late for work
cherry petals in her hair

music
through the hollow reed
oil of myrrh

prairie wind
snow fills the mouth
of the badger hole

after rain
two magpies take turns
preening themselves

they seem to drift out
of waning moonlight
snow clouds

each lilac showing me
what i do not know
about lilacs

breakfast in bed
your raisin cinnamon kiss

using the mirror
my mother gave me the other side
magnified

midnight another ping
from the empty pop can

a hazy face
in the sleet mirror
granite tombstone

widow for a year now
his hat missing
from the hook

at the antique store
deep in the empty dresser
the sun's rays

your beard
soft against my neck
sun through the blinds

icy sidewalk
step by step
in another's footsteps

between the winter
and spring naked tree
with a single leaf

picking apples
more and more
light into emptiness

did i tell you
more than you could bear
winter hyacinth

hiroshima day
a dandelion clock
at my feet

choice
in all directions
wind

like a prayer
the dandelion sinks
in the clouds

falling leaf
i'm drawing
my family tree

waxing moon
all the answers
in a lullaby

half-lit moon in the sky
i invent stories
about the other half

i've read it
so many times right now
two uncut pages

a well-to-do region
even the scarecrow
is elegantly dressed

the elevator
is moving up
kids with balloons inside

death will come
in through the vein
expanding in my leg

the seconds of the woodpecker
run faster than the clock's

end of summer
the three-leaved
clovers are huge

coming out of the museum
i'm wearing an ionian smile

slow dance heartbeat
ahead of the rhythm

fog over the river
only bird song reveals
the hidden islands

the most humane sound
a flautist takes a breath

bare vineyards
the hill from the childhood
growing down

like children
lost in a museum

painting the wall
my son's first picture
disappears

night train's far whistle
i'm in the room with a book
on my knees

summer evening
a street light
thickens the dusk

maturing slowly
like winter pears
first raindrops

spring wind
the girl let
the freckles fly up

the moon is drawing
silky rustle from
the mulberry tree

meteorites
mythical messages
from atlantis

the ox eats the grass
and we eat the ox
god had no imagination

wash rinse shake
the sand finally in the sieve
a nugget remains

in the white snow
the rigid blue stain
of the dead bird

a crystal glass
on the table invents all
the colors of the rainbow

on the desert road
a simple fall of leaves
broke the silence

echo of thunder
the downpour suddenly
brings the river up

in his tiny cell
he contemplated pensively
the flight of the fly

moonlight in the fog
inside the dark hut
the creak of hammocks

the light without pomp
languishes the last swallow
crosses the afternoon sky

peaceful afternoon
the trees calm they expect us to walk
quietly among them

look between one
raindrop and another
the rain doesn't wet

night of spawning
the indiscreet moon
shows the route of the shoal

between your sky and mine
a soft whisper of wings

a red traffic light
fire and lipstick
your mouth in the mirror

in the light of the bonfire
an old man loses his wrinkles
as he tells his stories

night vigil
the dog's eyes shine
by the fire

the sparrow
hides from the cold
in the scarecrow's pocket

bamboo stalk
a guitar that cries
in the wind

suddenly
thunder awakens
fears of my childhood

creaking wheels
it's lost in the fog
the ox wagon

tea ceremony
three guests
and one mosquito

clothes hung up
the flash of lightning
whitens the clothes line

a gentle breeze
the soap bubble takes colors
from the garden

orange harvest
the passing train
takes the sweet scent

white lily
the first communion
of a shy boy

the afternoon dissolves
in the shout of macaws
and in flakes of lead

musical agenda
gasping swallows
land briefly

lively conversation
on the porch two beggars
under blankets

long conversation
one cricket stops
another starts

autumn moon
the sleeping drunk in the park
is illuminated

a broken button
in a garden of roses
the thread's on the thorn

a gentle touch
maybe it's a memory
or a butterfly

a man with a rod
the fish is in the river
waiting for breakfast

a prayer in a holy grove
so as to the oak
who are these people

a sketch of a wood stove
drawn in a raging snowstorm
by an orphan child

black dust is falling
a matchstick which is half burned
between the fingers

bosnia
a country of man stone and dreams
a divine omen

fir-trees are high
but drown nevertheless
into birds' song

how soft they appear
the needles of the pine tree
after the first snow

i'm laying long
lying with my eyes open
looking into myself

i wasn't brave
to go out into my yard
there was a dove

leap over a thorn
running away from the pain
i broke a flower

my underpanties
are washing in a whirlwind
while i'm watching still

summer in prague
suddenly i noticed
an arabian rose

the dawn of honey
and an ancient call-beware
innocent write down everything

the day is nightblind
only a raindrop glows
on the dark windowglass

the knee is glowing
on the bare knee the pollen
has gently fallen

the nests are so high
on the stone of resistance
thunders are nesting

the rooster is here just
in time for the lunch time
the lunch time of ours

the songs i've burned
are the songs that have made
the best distance from myself

the television has broken down
inside the screen
we see our faces

the wild rose blooms
smells discreetly and stings
it grows where it wants

there are kind of days
when the silence is speaking
the rest is silent

tombstones
moved to the museum
yet they are all our kings!

villains you should know
hamid is waiting for you
shaheed on eternal guard

we swim on our backs
us in the ocean the cloud
in the sky

you the traveller
a friend do you feel the fragrance
of our bosnian soul?

flood debris
a doll's limb
pale in the seaweed

starless night
pier lights disappear
into surf noise

no money for the busker
i try not to listen

scent of old tea
roses faraway moon

after the parade
the dragon head off
still smoking

on a bare twig
rain beads
what light there is

anzac day
a baby's cry fills
our minute's silence

hung over
the red eye
of the traffic light

five years on
and still i haven't opened
mother's suitcases

swirling loops
in her letter
her voice

a sliver of moon
the old bluesman breaks a string

across sun shower
light a reckless flash
of parrots

a quiet kind of love
autumn crocus

barbed wire
a magpie teases out
a strand of wool

afternoon beach
the young lovers cast
a single shadow

crematorium
early and late mourners
compare deaths

mangrove
a crab's pincer wedged
in tangled roots

at the car park
as we say goodbye
a swirl of old papers

passing traffic
the flicker of bees
among grevillea

shingle beach
trying out its third couple
a dog lost at dusk

mosquito
a stranger's blood
on my hand

old wallpaper
my daughter reaches
for the butterfly

stonefish
the more a thing is thought about
the further it recedes

one drop
from the heron's foot
splits open the sky

on the coffin lid
our faces
in the clouds

midday the silence
both sides of a
kookaburra's laugh

windy morning
my pavement shadow
has some crazy hair

dandelions
a field of wishes
blows away

fields of stubble
the sky thick with stars

a clatter of milking pails
full winter moon

warmer days
balloon-vine tendrils
twist between the floorboards

night in flames
fireflies

after the storm
the homelessness
of fallen leaves

full moon
cumulus clouds
slowly form a wolf

maasai village
cattle bells
awakening the dawn

a committee gathers
in celebration
dying buffalo

morning snail
stuck on another
stuck on a leaf

gunshot
a flock of birds take cover
in the open sky

full sunshine
rainbow perishing
into butterflies

winter cold
a swan shakes
off the night

harmattan fire outbreaks
one surest way
of communal gathering

daddy come quick and look
the sky is so full
of god's foot prints

my grandson greets
the fridge first
last night's chicken

african summer
elephants trumpet
in the dusty plains

muddy trail of footprints
i step inside the shoe of another

wavy sea
a lad and his boat
seesaw

harmattan winds
the stiff permed pattern
of dry grasses

soft afternoon
baby patting the stars
from its cot

funeral speech
i put down my sorrows
in a haiku

savannah encounter
robins cheer on
a gruesome combat

weaver birds
the bombed market
echoes back to life

year's end
her skipping rope
too short

cold harmattan morn
a shot of gin
keeps the cabman going

harmattan wind
clattering dry leaves
count their days

black mamba coiled
in sugar cane field
scythe glistening

i looked around me
in the middle of the street
suddenly i am lost

another lemon tree
in another country
my gazes are desires

song of the cicada
between two roofs a gray cat
leaps on the moon

roasting sun
the egret's measured steps
in buffalo shadow

stone in my pocket
the brook cuts deeper
into the mountain

loon calls
my daughter drawing circles
near the fire

wilderness canyon
my shout and its echo
quickly lost in time

farewell hike
windswept emptiness
of haleakala

hiking to makapuu point
someone's name
carved in cactus

rattlesnake country
shadows of storm clouds
darken the foothills

lake cherokee an echo
in each breaststroke

rising stars
from my house to yours
six constellations

blue sea
the paper kite rises
again from the sand

fork of the road
the rusty signpost
points to the sky

dawn
the smell of wild horses
permeates the fog

dawn
river otters tease
my boat into the current

out of the agave
out of the blue
guadalupe

morning fog
on the coastal route
wild mustard

gnarled oak
my path to the hills
begins in mist

first time
swimming with my son
in water over our heads

distant thunder
overhead a satellite
moves in the dark

far from home
i find a shell
by the tokko river

each swig
of the bottled water
the sky

switchback trail
my hand slides round
the polished tree

edge of day
across the prairie
the scrape of wind

roadside violet
all the places
i've yet to go

blackberry brier
an old boundary post
clawed by bears

june breeze
a hole in the cloud
mends itself

spring
a helium balloon
breaks free

putting on my dancing shoes
summer wind

prairie motel
from my window
stars and fireflies

back roads
ella sings heaven

roadside cafe
on the flatbed truck
bits of a fairground

road trip
bringing home grasshoppers
from five states

driving east
across nebraska
a cloud epic

a silver hair
woven into the nest
winter light

distant thunder
a line of footprints
still escaping the waves

a tinge of blue
in the hare's footprints
winter moon

middle aged
a few more wrinkles
in the suit

to say grace
a whiff of grandma's timbre
in my voice

old jazz record
a scratch improvises

zen garden
snow melts
in raked patterns

one petal's rain
falls to another
then another

my atlas bones
the crushing scent
of home cooking

deep snow
i step into footprints
going the other way

ground zero
into the new
friend's story

virgin snow
a fox makes prints
for the morning

an elvis stamp
on the sympathy card
autumn dusk

long day
the shadow
of an answer

cicada husk
also clinging
to a straw

memorial wall
my son's name
carved on sirens

silver wedding taste
of the wild raspberries
still sweet and tart

cobalt sky
grandma's name
misspelled in granite

snow upon snow
the layers of oblivion
in my father's mind

autumn wind
the slant in the handwriting
of my former self

am i to be
the words no more

clouds drift
the trail of a rain drop
on a dirt covered leaf

petal by petal
the yellow rose
on her inner thigh

desert sunrise
smell of rain
outlives the rain

the shortcut the school children take
a new layer of leaves
matted into the old

in the footprints
of the warriors poppies

first date
the wedding ring's mark
hidden in a glove

lingering
among golden leaves
the fragrance of summer

following the frequencies
of civilizations
one snail one pen

early thaw
the earth tugging
at my footsteps

i am the age
my father never was
spring planting

arguing healthcare
my father forgets
his blood pressure

gay wedding
his father gave him away
years ago

my father and i
quarreling face to face
exchange breath

planting season
all these tubes
coming out of him

robin's egg blue
how my father would have loved
my son

brush strokes
the mother
i'll never be

mother's day
most of our verbs
in past tense

her silence
enters the granite
of her sons' headstones

the childhood
my mother glosses
over black ice

soapsuds
mother tells me
how she'd like to die

mother's day
still unwrapping
the lies she told me

over the loom
a spider
weaves with grandma

grandma's kitchen
the silver polish
smells of moonlight

grandma's birthday
counting the rings
on her aged fingers

first serial publication
grandma asks
when i started drinking

hearing aid
grandma now complains
about the squirrels

tall tales in the shadegrandpa shifts his tobacco
to the other cheek

dawn moon
grandfather quietly candling
our morning eggs

wee hours in the big house
after granddad's wake
my uncles' snoring

behind the deli counter
my grandfather's dreams
sliced thin

around the table
three generations
in the candles' glow

amid war
and rumors of war
another grandchild

recalling a song
from his first language
apricot blossoms

bedside vigil
she asks me again
if i watered her violets

telling granddad i smoke
he raises my allowance

crescent moon
the curve of her
mill-worn fingers

faint smell of his pipe
a shoebox of photos
his face scratched out

anzac day
we remember
to remember

beehives beneath
kiwifruit vines
the white half-moon

aftershock
the crack in my biscuit

powhiri
women sit behind the men
guessing who farted

behind the sheep truck
the smell of grass and hills

outgoing tide
my mother's togs
a year looser

off-street parking
cabbage tree fragrance
fills the spaces

fish and chips
first night home
the smell

beach innings
three driftwood stumps
and a dog at mid on

tenting on the lawn
the kids inside
at possum time

virgin forest
birdsong thickens
the trees

storm warning
the cry of a shearwater
circles the sky

smokefree building
the roof in a cloud

anzac morning
from each umbrella rib
a raindrop

hotpools
my breasts weightless
in your hands

night shelter
two bums discuss
pavlova

christmas morning
finding a weta
in my sock

mountain track
finding a rock
that fits my arse

backyard cricket
dad and i pick up
the kitchen window

a giant rimu falls
within an hour
rain

citizenship ceremony
he mouths the words
to the haka

just then
magpies borrowing
denis glover's song

drowning the possum
in the clear lake
the stars

after the game
full moon between
the goalposts

tea tree the shape
of an ocean breeze

day moon
hoof prints litter
the beach track

cerulean river
quickening my heartbeat

blue for now
what tarries beyond
a song

the iris in my eyes
open wider the fading
colors of sunset

my favorite color
nothing
is my middle name

green ink
mountain lake
where the dream healing is

a whisper of lipstick
speaking tomes

cobalt blue bottle
her evening in paris

the translucence
of every white lie
honesty pods

pink carnation
you're gonna love me
in an instant

blue gum
i taste a mouthful
of mountain air

banana sweat
the sound of a gun

crowded train
a dozen yellows
crackle

blue moon
from the old guitarist
a rain song

deadline whistles
the train red

a green shoot
from buddha's nose
who wants to grow old

after the ultrasound
everything in bloom

splitting atoms
this magenta behind words

remembering
periwinkle
in c sharp

crayon box
no shade yet
for my state of mind

malignant doubts
tasting of a yolk
helium sun

summertime blues
holding my breath
exhaling the world

breakfast table the light
from a peeled orange

moth in daylight
i dream in colors
she is made of

ink black
as ink resting
in the shape of an a

chopping wood
someone does the same
a moment later

walk's end
the cold of his hand
shook mine

wedding reception
the weight of her bottle
on the lip of my cup

sculpture garden
the marble bench
cool through my jeans

before the ether flash
of a nurse's cross

slicing papaya
the swing of her black pearls

i'm waiting
the cherries
are ripening

sudden windbreak
everyone pauses
to stare at the dog

sudden breeze
the dog sniffs the hisses
of a gopher snake

crickets
the pulse in a hollow
of her neck

evening news
the soothing weight
of the quilt

plum blossoms falling
her fingers lift
from the braille

sniffing the air
sharp emptiness
of the approaching storm

starry sky
the aftertaste of iron
on my bitten tongue

aspen in the rain
each leaf drips with the sound
of autumn

cold moon
still the weight of her baby
in my arms

my cold foot
steps on her bra
still warm

opening a window
to hear the cicadas
continuing

slime trail
glancing back
at the glinting

summer's end
i let the thimbleberry
rest on my tongue

lit fish stall
open mouths darken
in the night

taking my glasses
the optician disappears
into the wall paper

white and purple
the scent of lilacs
is a ladder too

lime
quarter of an icecube
collapses over jazz

fire coals
the darker crackle
of pond ice

a solitary bird
calls to the space between
lightning and thunder

waking to the scent
of jasmine rice
a dream?

heat shimmers
the flicker of
a lizard's tongue

symmetry
in the bare willows
the shape of longing

rusted hinge
the butterfly's wings
close open

rain all day
i carve the darkness
from a peach

retreating glacier
how long since we've heard
the black wolf's song

storm on the lough
streetlamps on seaview
lit by sunrise

dawn swim
making a butterfly
of water of light

cold aegean sun
the temple half stone
half shadow

dedicated
to the moon i rise without
a decent alibi

sun in the bones
of a darting minnow
my cell phone rings

fading daylight
an oarsman's ballad
drifts ashore

november cherry blossom
what was i thinking

leaving the movies
believing this world
is the real one

the moon is broken
battersea power station
from a train window

theater of the absurd
all the roles played
by the moon

bitter cold morning
some of the sunrise
compressed with the trash

hoar frost
the dead spider
drawn into a star

christmas songs
deepening the loneliness

all over
what little light
a star has for us

tasting
she sticks her tongue out
at the winter

winter's end
light pulls back
to the surface

first dawn alone
the widow eats his half
of the orange

dappled sunlight
the broad back of the man
picking snowdrops

adding another
shade of white to winter
the gull

winter sunlight
a priest blesses
father's eyelids

epiphany
the unsaid between us
extinguished

as if the moon
had a hundred moons
lantern festival

speckled egg
the sunlight on my thoughts

where the sun is a myth
a haiku grows
in a dog's ear

not quite dawn
the milky breath
of a newborn calf

up to the summit
up to a hawk's cry
up to the sun

distant thunder
the dog's toenails click against
the linoleum

freezing rain
the cafe crooner
slips out of tune

september rain
hoping his nap will last
the chapter

rain settles
some of the pollen
some of the plans

gathering light
at the tip of the acorn
yesterday's rain

rainy morning
the wife showering
abuses on her husband

the thrum
of a dying cat's purr
soft rain begins

a different pitch
from room to room
summer rain

drenching rain
i restore myself
to factory settings

the comfort
of morning rain aching
with experience

the rain
almost a friend
this funeral

quiet again
paper boats brim
with yesterday's rain

all day rain
i rub olive oil
into the butcher block

smell of rain
a hummingbird stirs
the stillness

night rain
the small serrated song
of a frog

deafening rain
we talk of the dead
in whispers

the many notes
of the falling rain
all in tune

rain on furrows
a seagull lowers
the sky

sharing an umbrella
your wet left shoulder
my right one

rainy morning
her baby's kicking
slows

warm sheets of rain
the old dog trembles
not knowing

a car passes and
the house realigns itself
in the puddle

spring rain
saturates the ground
school shootings

steady rain
a goose opens a wing
for her young

biopsy
the nurse's voice
turns into rain

soft rain
a plum tree
in its third trimester

simmering
rice grains in the pot
patter of rain

sudden cloudburst
mona lisa in chalk
turns expressionist

heavy spring rain
checking the young basil plants
for survivors

dead cat
open mouthed
to the pouring rain

forbidden burning
in thick fog muffled cawing
from the rookery

frosty pasture
a crow eats pieces
of the morning sun

pairs of ravens
the feeling of loneliness

falling crows
the growing shadows
of the cold war

croaking ravens
i spread my feathers
and join in

mossy headstone
the raven's cry deepens
the stillness

crows in the dust
how little we know
about each other

across patches of snow
a raven's cry
reminds me of me

new crack
across the whole pond
the raven's caw

ravens
raindrops falling
from the dead tree

out of the tall pines
a pair of ravens tumble
the storm front darkens

wide grassland
the crow stretches its call
from pylon to pylon

somber shadows
on the trees
the first ravens

evening sky
a flock of crows
turn off the light

teacher's question hangs
in the drowsy classroom
a crow answers

monet's haystacks
a group of crows tug
at twilight

raven's shadow
above the door
my hiking song

headless scarecrow
a raven picks the stuffing
out of its neck

raven shadow
clinging tightly
to my victim story

winter crow
an eyelash on
your pillow

still autumn
a baby crow caws
with each fallen leaf

snow follows snow
the way a raven moves
over the mountain

empty park
two crows start
the world over

across the snowfield
chases sharp dog barking
after a crow

broad glare
a crow passes through
the bone-chilling cold

nearly deaf
the beautiful songs
of crows

march evening
sunshine floating on crow wings
through the mass of houses

crow caws
in all directions
the endless traffic

dry heat
the rasp in
the crow's caw

unravelling the storm
crowflight in rain

moonless night
depths of darkness
lapping the pier

a dried lotus leaf
in tibetan book of the dead
winter dusk

midnight moon
the violet of violets
almost black

starless sky
the black cord
to the fuse box

turn of the year
after catherine
wheels the dark

longest night
tasmanian tigers
pace the underworld

the coolness of glass
touching darkness

down below
singing to the darkness
great whales

night of her death
through our telescope the moons
of jupiter blur

up late with old friends
my daughter and her blankie
out of the dark

further down the cobble beach
the face of another sunset-watcher
loses its copper glow

the reef's silence
sea fans brighten darken
with the current

the old ways
a blackbird sings
from a celtic cross

night wind
the bush comes alive
with dreamtime stories

train tunnel
the sudden intimacy
of mirrored faces

dark moon
the pull of a planet
beyond pluto

black swan
water drops
jewel the neck

entering my room
her shadow slips
into her

if not for the shadow
on the canyon wall i would
have missed the condor

night time
in the hospice aquarium
the pulse of fish gills

dark night
the sea swallowing
the silver sand

peat bog pool
the darkness beneath
pond skaters

nectarine moon
the sky dark
with fruit bats

in the photo darkroom
i leave a postcard
of cherry flowers

lifting the veil
on the age of the universe
gamma ray burst

a black jewel set
in down of the softest blue
my parakeet's eye

a night train passes
pictures of the dead are trembling
on the mantelpiece

campfire embers
stars shine out from
the blackened billy

the dark of night
yet growing across the valley
the mountain's shadow

nagasaki
in her belly the sound
of unopened mail

cracked soil
a day laborer bent
over his shadow

wide blue sky
a wisp of moon above
the razor wire

heat cracked stone
the weight of a gun
in a child's hand

fifth shower
no soap cleans their hands
from her skin

not named in the will
the man and woman bequeathed
to his children

shooting star
a child loses
his war on drugs

trembling fault line
her next beating
in his voice

online hunting
he scores for a fee
little boys and girls

rape
the breaking off
of everything

crescent moon
the air we breathe
is propaganda

war movie
everyone goes home
when it ends

last message
from the boston bomber
they set me up

another lunch-time walk
in some places
mothers drown their young

revolution again
a copse of cherries razed
while still in bud

winter wind
feathers and fishbones shift
inside the eyrie

butterflies
among the brambles
in a field of bricks

hiroshima
the shadow of a tree
in the old wall

war zone
on the newscast a bucket
marked red paint

the siren stops
at the draped body
hopscotch markings

a woman beheaded
i let the dandelions
go to seed

where did i learn
this awkward embrace
brittle grass

stasi files
the sweaty silence
between old friends

lightning flash
a policewoman arrives
to take her statement

a train in madrid
so many cell phones
unanswered

i kill an ant
and realize my three children
have been watching

the baby
even when shown a flower
opens its mouth

computer crash
in a panic i call
my 9 year old

with strange sounding names

for the tooth fairy

takes a step forward

starts to loosen

out of her buggy

from my birth mother how do i
say hello to me

sunlit sweat
the young vagrant
sucks a thumb

two boys giggle
as he enters the bike shop
the onion seller

early spring
winding up balsawood planes
with his son

only in the dream
my daughter takes a ripe melon
up to her soft cheek

the peony was big as this
says the little girl
opening her arms

bending to kiss
the soft cheeks of my baby
i hear the sharp cry of a shrike

between the slats of the window
a tiny hand held out
to feel the rain

children don't
don't catch the fly
she too has children

the first melon of the season
slumbers on the breast
of the sleeping child

a child arranges
rice cakes in a row
each time saying
this one is mine

asked how old he was
a boy in a new kimono
stretched out all five fingers

i wonder how far
he has wandered away
chasing after his dragonfly

champa blossoms
the child plucks the sky

painting class
the children color each other
into laughter

she looks down
from the tenth floor apartment
umbrellas on legs

her new kitchen arrives
from playmobil

tinsel halo
the child asks a british soldier
if he's been good

spring cleaning
my daughter's to keep pile
growing

pausing over twin washboards
a migrant wife's eyes
lifted to the moon

wind along the beach
an abandoned shoe
slowly fills with sand

new home
the junk store lamp
looks trendy

war and the rumors of war
still the routine
of bee and clover

favorite old song
young again if only
for a moment

roadside chiles
bagging my order the man
invites me to live here

mouthed by loud men

and holds out his hand

my son's birth year
on a penny

from the desert heat
there is no escape

the shape of autumn
in the wind

helping grandmother
rewind her yarn

october moon
a werewolf kisses
cleopatra

nursing home
an unfinished mitten
still on the needles

crisis center
toddler clutches
a fistful of fist

sleeping in
that big white cloud
out the window

without taking a drink
my thirst is quenched

clouddrift
a mockingbird
changes its song

getting up the nerve
to find out
electric fence

i burp onions
the long night
of winter

for its looks

they never worry
where to park around the church
city songbirds

august evening
summer turns to fall
with the leaves

england
sheep grazing
among gravestones

a neighbor's tree
divides the moon

the gentle way
you touch my hand

almost winter
the loneliness
of a waning moon

midwinter
an empty hearse
passes the lily pond

closing time
bartender collects empties
filled with stories

in my tea

father asks where i intend
to be buried

in the pumpkin soup

inside her turns
wild mustard

an old argument
scraping the burned rice
out of the pot

outdoor cafe
two gray heads bowed
over one bowl of noodles

blue moon
i hide behind
these onion tears

the first bite
is all i want
wild pear

the holocaust
and morning coffee
bind two old friends

dusk brightens
the smoke of baked shells
autumn shores

hot and sour fish soup
all the right ingredients
stirring up the moon

bubbling vats of cheese
a slice of sunlight shines
through a high window

slicing red peppers
the secret
i can't tell

on an old recipe card

with garlic

the other's hands

his hand on her thigh
one cloud slips
into another

heavy in my hand

of her life

to the doctor's hand

the squeak of my hands
on my daughter's coffin

to the wheel

for another

sun on the canal
a floating football
slowly turning

quickens

at your grave

after the game

at silly mid-on

a walk-off home run
up and over
the prison wall

on the beach
frozen waves

the moon is somewhere
rising through the snowy night
the nibelung's ring

boundary stones
on the old battlefield
melting snow

frosty evening
the smell of a book
just arrived

stella maris
a myriad of lives
in my mind

wistfulness
not even a message
in a bottle

shipping containers
stacked up on the horizon
hollow cries of gulls

waves at the shore
telling excitedly
from distant ships

watched by a satellite
i carry ben webster
in my pocket

morning star
a can of cherry cola
starts to fizz

humpbacks
the depths
we float on

summer dawn
an empty wheelchair
at the ocean's edge

she praises the wrong
romanian film

circle by circle
described by the beam of the beacon
pale the full moon

from this and other side
question marks

homeland and home

planted in a little pot
all holland is there!

my gray hair

the sound creates
my own ocean

at the soldier's grave
a stranger's salutation

the other end
of the war
fat man

seagulls carry
the moonlight across
backwater

along the beach
tai chi shadows

a mime's glance
crosses mine

an old woman sweeps
the walk of cherry blossoms
children's laughter

summer's end
i stop myself talking
to a stranger's child

the cheery yellow
taxi that takes you away
my dark mood

a clothesline
sags beneath the weight
of all those aching backs

not quite incense
a smoldering cigarette
at the curb

quietly
we become
audience

roller coaster
we have no advice to offer
the newlyweds

in passing
to another waitress
her real smile

pasture cairn
the old farmer's
bent spine

country store
two old timers whittle
over world affairs

dying fire
i sit quietly
with my ghosts

pushes another
in a swing

on the harley
ladybug

the freshly painted name
on the overpass

an old man also talking
to himself

long night
internet friends
of internet friends

magnolia blossoms
the kindness of a stranger
in the mississippi fog

sex under stars
the blindness of two strangers
lost in the moonshine

polished wood in my hand
the hand of the artisan

post office queue
we learn all about
his family overseas

he only tells
the guy at the gas station
he's in love

a saxaphone plays
beside the slight percussion
of coins in a cup

at the farmer's stand
a woman scolds her children
my children listen

inside pitch
learning to pronounce
new names

blizzard shutting down
the city drug dealer
still at his corner

bus stop
the winter dance
of cold feet

parking tower
a white-throated sparrow
singing on an empty floor

st patrick's night
an old man pounds his fist
on the hood of a taxi

back to work
someone else
in my parking place

at the bus stop
breathing in the bus

he's elected mayor
the boy who pulled my pigtails

a hawk glides
between downtown buildings
cloudless sky

a few tiles missing
from the chessboard in the park
november sun

in the taxicab
a gold fish restless
in his bowl

escalator
up from the subway tunnel
snowfall

searching
even among skyscrapers
first pear blossoms

haiku conference
even the taxi driver
has an opinion

parade over
one last twirl
of her baton

what a hard job it must be
statue of liberty

at murasaki's grave
birds chitter from the trees
roar of traffic

uptown girl
i listen to her speak
as fast as i can

after black dreams
the urban orange night

jet-black tunnel
the sudden blast
of autumn color

too hot to sleep
from the fire truck's siren
a map of the streets

winter stars
the sirens fade

st patrick's day
a traffic cop
directs gridlock

urban dusk
another shot
clanks off the rim

wine rings
on the cafe tables
spring wind

her iphone
back between her thighs
the traffic moves on

up warm subway stairs
the shifting mix of scents

outside the museum
two pigeons drink reflections
of a skyscraper

city night
a light left on
the 43rd floor

still thinking
about that bird in the tunnel
the radio flares back on

an old woolen sweater
taken yarn by yarn
from the snowbank

desert dunes
i yearn for my home
along the riverbank

dried oregano
adding a summer kigo
to my winter stew

this rain
i must have heard it
somewhere before

trading a past life
regression for a past life
rape

leaf fall
how easily i slip
between seasons

am i the ghost
of a child who died before me
autumn deepens

flowing river
my mother recalls
india's partition

autumn dusk
the descent of light
into its past

stirring spices
into mama's chipped bowl
diwali feast

detention lines
the way of the transgressor
chalked on the black board

blueberry wine
last summer's fireflies
deep inside

refugee camp
sculpting the tree trunk
into a cross

pressed flower
i remember being
beautiful

cloud patches
recalling my faint memories

sleeping through beethoven's 5th
we left the dead volcano

in this sweet pea posy
suddenly the past

as if tsunami
had been a fabrication
the calm sea in spring

ancient eras
sometimes we'd say that's a first
for a male

chalk outline
fading memory
of misspent youth

kissing his forehead
for the last time
snow on the mountains

basket full of sun
mother folds the morning's wash
clothespin by clothespin

home visit
i search my father's footprints
on the village road

buson's grave
a wet hydrangea
bows its head

vague shapes beckon
through the thicket
alzheimer's

autumn evening
i lightly touch
my son's first scribbles

homesickness for the scent
of sunlight in her hair

scent of a pain balm
in the railway station
memories of my father

light rain
the postman's bike
outside the shop

winding road
a council worker paints
the s on low

island airport
our baggage handler puts on
his pilot's cap

in between fillings
the dentist again
talks of his son

the house painter
descending his ladder
blue sky

community meeting
the priest adds up
his mileage claim

the bookshop owners
at their computers
singing

easter wedding
the chauffeur in a tangle
with the umbrella

musician's funeral
the organist's wrong chords

laughing gas
the dentist and i compare
our old draft numbers

after the op
my surgeon outside
studying the clouds

slow day
the barber cuts
coupons

last thing friday
the mechanic belts out
a neil diamond song

early closing
a waitress sits
in a circle of light

afternoon drizzle
the driving instructor
swaps sides

the gravedigger
staring out into space
then back at the grave

last persimmon
the real estate agent
suggests a lower price

summer's end
a carnival worker tells me
about his life

stopping the postman
each day fewer leaves
on the cherry tree

waist high in fog
the groundsman marks out
the football pitch

withering wind
the fence builder pulls a nail
from his lips

speeding ticket
the cop in no hurry
to give it to me

late autumn
the rug-hooker works in her
last scrap of orange

winter mist
four gravediggers watch
a fifth dig

winter night
the chestnut vendor
in a cloud of steam

christmas week
the fishmonger's face
expressionless

in gown and slippers
a surgeon pauses with the
racing page

mountain hike
we drink from the beginning
of a great river

night of stars
all along the precipice
goat bells ring

how i linger
at the summit
autumn colors

prairie stream
what i know about mountains
in these stones

in the mountains
divorce papers
delivered by hand

thirty years of this
thirty years of that
the blue-green mountains

winter mountains
an old friend disappears
into the mist

hiking into the clouds
the view within

the old preacher
walking by the mountains
head down

first coolness
for a moment i see it
without a name mt fuji

mountain sunset
among pine
one red-leafed tree

nobody to overtake
the mountain path

mountain air
a caterpillar reaches
the twig's end

mountain pool
in its clarity small stones
and the flash of minnows

just sitting here
spring about to burst from
the mountain laurel

wavering
down the mountain pass
a yodel

my problems forgotten
a path through the pines
up the mountain

mountain moonrise
the sound i didn't know
i had in me

by my burro's ears
seeing even after dark how
the mountain nears

dust from the mountains
a rainbow rises
on carwash mist

the first lights come on
above the eastern mountains
a glimmer of stars

the elk herd
moving down the ridge
an early snow

a light river wind
on the crannied cliff hang
harebell and fern

sun boils over the mesa
a cholla bud opens
red

summer alp summit
the raven's croak ebbs
into the vastness

mountain pass
we rebuild the cairn
to fit the wind

nothing but mountains
and yet with every wind
the smell of the sea

just a minnow
the granite mountain wobbles
on the lake

the barnacled flukes
of migrating whales
mountains lost in haze

splitting wood
the mountain cool
deepens at sunset

noonday heat
the mountains recede
in pale blue

shiva's temple
a toddler chants along
in baby talk

vast empty space inside
the cathedral fills
with organ music

copper wire
around the bonsai
autumn sun

balinese story dancers
long trained fingers swirl
in the bonfire light

with a stamp and a snap
she strikes a defiant pose
the flamenco dancer

harvest moon
the square dance caller
sips from a flask

summer wind
my daughter chasing
a charizard

end of the world
nobody stays
for the credits

a single cloud
she spends the evening
cutting quilt pieces

war and peace
a hundred pages in
he surrenders

moon viewing
the silence
as my pen stops

1812 overture
another conductor
one row ahead

winter storm
i change my mind
about opera

buttermilk clouds
my mother's voice singing
an old cowboy song

40 years in
the postman still carries
a tune

tulip bulbs
that first piano recital
still in my fingers

after the parade
the snapping latches
of trumpet cases

jukebox
the barmaid
gives me a tip

distant stars
and my music
among them

city bus
a diversity
of ring tones

writing a check
for the lithograph
of escher's hands

the soup can
before andy warhol
and after

lost glasses
crawling through the landscapes
of dali

mixing red and yellow paint
my son discovers fire

the wait in line
to wait in line
matisse exhibit

working
with the time he's got left
sand sculptor

the sculptress
never touching
her own hands

christmas play
the wise man forgets
his next line

actor
in a family
of critics

foghorns
we lower a kayak
into the sound

riveredge old growth
a towering window
of stars

summer's end
again the river
red with salmon

fog
inside and out
seattle ferry

sudden sun
snow peaks brighten
for the long drive home

the first chip
in our windshield
northern star

fogged in
sea mist fills
the foxglove bells

misty spring light
every bare branch glows
moss green

releasing him
the bull trout's back
scarred by talons

space needle
the news helicopter's
sun flash

windfall apple
i relish the
wormless side

juneau icefield
cocky tourist looking for
skate rentals

slate gray glacial water
the guide talks of
blueberries

salmon run
the bridge clogged
with people

mount st helens
how humble and delicate
the footpath lily

moss hangs down
dripping with rain
my mother's voice

patchy fog in the bay
when it lifts will the islands
still be there

village island
a row of totems
buried in moss

minus tide
my hairline
receding

a pod of orcas
how blue the sky
they touch with light

one deep breath
for a moment the pine
is part of me

that whale i could have touched
surfaces again
in my mind

rainier behind clouds
i take a picture
where it might be

sound
of the first float plane
dividing the rain

leaving
ponderosas comb a low tone
from the wind

end of summer
the soft touchdown
of a seaplane

wind in the cedars
sometimes i shudder
with happiness

top of the space needle
how it feels to spot
a whale

the trail narrows
every shadow a possible
bear

a leaf underfoot
gathers rainwater enough
to show open sky

morning fog
climbing the shell
of an old lighthouse

new moon
another chance
to make it right

spring snow melt
forgetting where the pain
is buried

pixel by pixel
light finds a way
night sky

lavender hour
here at the furthest edge
of sorrow

on both sides
of the barbed wire
soft moonlight

seashell collection
gran whispers the name
of the child she lost

dark news
the comfort
of crows

fading bruises
birdsong in the distance

at the end
of the wrong road taken
a flower

just when we thought
she'd live forever
starlight

cane in hand
he pauses to feel
the sunshine

in pine shade
for a while i forget
this life will end

for now
a spark
just that

the loss
of our farm land
keeping the moon

deep woods
happy to just
be

cat scratch
another lie
about my scars

her rusted sewing machine
newly threaded
with wild violets

broken love
the departing cries
of gulls

mayfly
so little
time

midnight moon
shedding light on the scars
of my past

self medication
the mirror breaks
eye contact

river moon
the slow bend
of the blues

returning
the sound of gunfire
returning

white chrysanthemum
who will remember me
when i'm gone

all is liquid
at some point
my excuses

a spatter
of raindrops on the window
abnormal cells

incomplete beings
you and me
complete the city

deep in nothing
a tiny blue speck
burning

whiskey chaser
promising myself an hour
of happiness

the over
and over
of over

flags at half mast
the silent cry
of the wind

crescent moon
a bone carver sings
to his ancestor

hot night
at the filling station
songs of love

the piano hammers
barely moving
night snow

sinking deep into winter
the blues singer's voice

spring breeze
i catch the tune
she leaves behind

settling on the
white blossoms
taps

tangled trees
the jazz singer
touches my pain

music two centuries old
the color flows out
of the tea bag

third blizzard
the untuned piano's
middle c

chinese opera
her voice inside
my teacup

70th birthday
gazing across the field
she hums a beatles' tune

summer breeze
children chase the music
of an ice cream truck

country church
the bleating of sheep
between hymns

starless night
from the barroom a love song
about red lips

tantric music
raindrops slide upward
on the windshield

violin player
the shape of the sound
in her arms

saturday night
jazz singer just off beat
just right

winter wind
a cradle song sung
in an ancient tongue

our cab ride
one love song long
spring moon

midday moon
the deaf child caresses
the grand piano

sax solo
of his eyes
only the white

taiko performance
a bit of funk in the
drummers' steps

shakuhachi concert
the man who slept through it
claps too

the fiddler's bow
shadow dancing

tuning the cello
finches turn their heads
this way and that

three chord progression
wrens pick it up
the grackles lay it down

slow dance
the thin fabric
between us

evening breeze
something close to mozart
in the chimes

o holy night
the burglar's footprints
in the snow

beethoven's ninth
raindrops bounce
from cobblestones

heat shimmers
the flicker of a lizard's
tongue

until my shadow
log full of turtles

sea turtle
her silence enters
the surf's roar

a squiggle of skinks
up the wall
sunrise

billabong crocodiles
circling the tourist boat

one small life
the ballistic arc
of a frog's leap

a snake
my adrenaline
faster

mood ring
a lizard eases
from green to brown

spring peeper
all that remains
of yesterday's thunder

dead wood
tiny copperheads coil
in the sunshine

first turtle
something in me
surfaces

crossing paths
a snake's stripes flicker
in the forest litter

early spring
not enough sun to move
the snake

harvest moon
cane toads crowding
the dog's bowl

rainforest track
the liana becomes
a tree python

moonless night
only alligator eyes
along the marsh

summer solstice
a garter snake's tongue
tastes the air

cloudburst
the sliding glass door
awash with treefrogs

water on the moon
frogs spreading the news

flash flood
the leopard tortoise
turns turtle

summer haze
stirring the grass a snake's
parting hiss

with each call
faint ripples surround
the frog

murky pond
an almost frog
comes up for air

end of march
the sleepy wood frog
lets me hold her

spring runoff
just enough pond
to catch a frog

frogspawn
in sun-dried pond
speckles mud

still water
the thrum of a bullfrog
the thrum of a bigger one

merging
with this orange sunset
frog song

so few feathers left
it barely has a name
the melting snow

rumors of war
up into a darkening sky
a child's newsprint kite

summer storm
the windscreen wipers
slice our silence

left to itself
a moon without
subtitles

almost autumn
so many holes to
another universe

a broken window
reflects half the moon
half of me

mockingbird
an octave shy
of the moon

train whistle
a blackbird hops
along its notes

working late
i meet my loneliness
in the long hallway

a falcon dives
how completely i
surround my bones

morning birdsong
requiring quotation marks

the wood breathes
a leaf falling
into fallen leaves

rumble of thunder
a sunbird comes darting
through the wire fence

between the sky
and the spin of the earth
this falling leaf

campfire sparks
someone outside the circle
starts another song

evening breeze
hundreds of lamp flames
sway in the temple

winter morning
scribbles on a scratch pad
get the ink flowing

icy rain
at the bottom of the lake
a door to yesterday

solstice moon
breasts that filled
and emptied

basho's frog
four hundred years
of ripples

coming home
flower by flower

cardboard boxes
my son turns himself
into a robot

aftershock
a tremor lingers
in the dog

migrating geese
the things we thought we needed
darken the garage

new year's day
the center of the chocolate
not what i expected

birth certificate
the name of the father
he never knew

spring afternoon
the schoolchildren return
to the dead squirrel

self portrait
some truth to the
smudges

stone
before stone
buddha

temple path
the dust i kick up
sticks to me

in the dream
my dog has a whistle
only i can hear

in my dream
i am accepted
as a crow

married now
she thinks of him
only in dreams

what the wind broke
catching bits and pieces
of my dream

i turned off my phone
darkness should equal silence
except in my dreams

dawn
the snowplow wakes me
from a dream of footprints

only in dreams
the music box
without a key

waking
from a dream of sweden
the sound of geese

frangipani
even in my dreams
that scent

first snow
the struggle to recall
last night's dream

lulled
back into dream
cicadas

dream over
a crow calls me
into another one

night dreams
through a shadowed doorway
a pale moon

in my dreams last night
wild arabian horses
i butter his toast

dreaming
my best haiku on paper
now how flat it seems

hunger moon
even my dreams
empty

one more dream of you
wild roses tangled up
in thorns

another tangled night
tossing into dreams

dreaming in yellow
wild buttercups

autumn mist
the recurring dream
of self

the short night
and yet i solve all my problems
in my dreams

dreaming again
a house i never knew

spring dream
a fox drenched
in purple rain

moonlight
i've had this conversation
in a dream

fireflies
the dreams i had
as a child

spindrift
the way dreams
take shape

in my dream
the father i didn't know
is there and not there

in a dream
i remove my wife's splinter
from my own finger

to capture the dream
i reach for a tape recorder
and wake up

winter night
i dream in
monochrome

heat lightning
an armadillo skitters
into a ditch

inside of me
bison are stampeding
across caves

chimpanzees whisper
they're just like us

the donkey foal's world
a field in flood

ice moon
an elk touches its tongue
to the salt lick

wires crossed
the flying fox forever
folds into night

autumn afternoon
where the epileptic fell
a fresh groundhog den

the hyena
outside of night
laughing

ibex cracking horns
the woodcutter's axe

with lines of light
the sun invents jaguars
in the gardens

new rain
the odour of kangaroos
from the hollow

the air spotted
by a speeding leopard

behind the mink
the moon has come
to pieces

morning sun
fish scales glisten
in the otter scat

rain on the ruin
steam lifts from the body
of quetzalcoatl

a rat falls
into the water jar
the cold night

skunk's stripe
first moments
of darkness

a tiger rearranges
suburban streets

a vole in the
watering can again
cloudless

a new world of snow
stitching it all together
tracks of a weasel

even in this snow
the sound of the wolverine
is a bright red shriek

free of the plow
the oxen move to the barn
side by side

a yak grazes
on winter stubble
everest's shadow

among the striped
shadows of his cage
the zebra

the twists
in old coyote shit
autumn wind

hippo
up to its eyes
in weightlessness

cool autumn
the slow grazing of a horse
in a field of horses

a marmot's whistle
pierces the mountain
first star

firelit cave
the sketch of a buffalo herd
starts to move

the hemming fence
must be magic too
captive unicorn

spring wind
spinning the barstool
the kid in me

fire hydrant
barefooted boys
drenched with laughter

winter solitaire
again and again
i draw the joker

that one kid
with the plastic whistle
evening heat

summer breeze
up on the swing
i escape my shadow

valentine's day
my wife reads up on
henry viii

porch swing
songs where we least
expect them

man made lake
swimming in our own
imaginations

halloween
death takes two
pieces of candy

long summer holidays
a doll on the pavement
missing hair

empty playground
a candy wrapper
goes down the slide

summer picnic
the ants start
with dessert

garden party
father talks to his plants
before guests arrive

autumn afternoon
my thoughts get off the train
with a group of girls

rainy day
red bikini on a chair
green tea in a cup

end of summer
in the pocket a seashell
and phone number

rabbit tracks
a snowman
with no nose

first date
letting her put snow
down my neck

touching tank
the anemone gets a feel
for the real me

snowstorm
a car accident
on playstation

old chestnuts
x-mas song fest
at the senior center

spring showers
racing each other
to the stream

heavy rain
end of the war
with cardboard swords

spring cleaning
jazz drum brushes
fade in

tossing the ball
back and forth a child
and the sea

soul searching
i punch all the buttons
in my new car

spring cleaning
dad throws out
his back

pondskater
the depth of our love
still uncertain

apple festival
the space around the guy
offering free hugs

children dragging
their shadows home
bright plastic sleds

old jazz record
a scratch
improvises

as geese arc
the fog closing behind them
the poem's false start

a forest
with an exit sign
my roughing it

in the brass door knob
a distorted face
i grip and twist

the anger from work
in my son's birthday balloons

driving past
the neighbor's corn
to buy the butter

a wolf
one firefly
clinging to it

illuminating
the silence between us
firefly

children squealing
slowly the oldest gorilla
focuses elsewhere

trying to forget him
stabbing the potatoes

this alamo
too small a place
for dying

bright moonlight tonight
male god ejecting water
into the plaza

cold night
the breath of children
being dragons

august cicadas
could i carry an ocean
in one suitcase

finches leaving
and with them daylight
savings time

snow covered village
i follow a stranger's footprints
over the bridge

behind the curtain
the opera singer carries her roses
through a dark forest

i wade in the brook
that he loved to paint
pull of the current

words still pink
close to the bone

eating the oyster
i set its shell adrift
a trip to oki isle

town barber pole
stops turning
autumn nightfall

silent night
the singing hands
of the deaf child

free of the sulky
the black horse continues
to trot

still wanting to fly
these feathers of
the dead owl

dancers
of invisible fish
are you awake

i sing too
the departing body
with autumn leaves

water flows
from the cutting board to the
time of a young girl

out of the mud
of another eon
something firm

a string sings
the tide turns jet black
and glitters

our feelings
have no right answer
the blue sky

morning beach
a flash of fish
catching the light

a rusty halo
hangs on an unlit taper
out of order

i wait for you
full like an empty bowl
radiant with dreams

how many ways
to become a butterfly
a mime on the stage

in the deepest part
of the kaleidoscope
the emperor's room

flying nowhere
blackbirds appearing out of
the painter's brush

lower half of my body
surrounded by ocean fish
saturday

i philosophize
on hearing the cries
of a meteorite

building a stone fence
a scattering of feathers

the long a of gray
the long a of rain
the shortest day

march in the garden
my hostess shows me brown sticks
and speaks of flowers

sunflowers
dad in uniform
last photo

sandpipers running
along the glassy beach
on top of themselves

new in town
the scent of
unknown flowers

among the gravestones
with names worn away
children play hide and seek

meteor shower
a gentle wave wets
our sandals

a bird on the mast
of the ship sings of cherry blossoms
the seaman begins to bloom

the sweet smell
from an unknown tree
repulses the metropolis

first light
dark limbs of the walnut
holding their snow

over the sand
scriptures of the birds
memories of the wind

as it thunders
the ears of the forest
become leaves

why threaten
a singing man with the stones
of existence

your shadow
on the page
the poem

the cat's cradle
the eiffel tower too
into winter

knowing one among miles
of white crosses

my hands
at rest in dishwater
first hummingbird

almost dusk
the raspberry stalk bends
with a purple finch

for me too
the song of the thrush
that landed somewhere else

forest pool
faun at the brink
of a bottomless sky

a red tail's echo
the reservoir the color
of surrounding pines

stern wind
the branch an osprey
adds to its nest

an evening seashell
with its pearly glow lights
the fisherman's way home

dense snowfall
the world's white
shadow

an angel of stone
has wings of stone
such solitude

each time
i try to smile
i also show my teeth

sleeping
with a fire colored mane
a silver horse

his life and
then her life gone
distant fireworks

all shadows
in praying posture
iris flowers

a deserted backyard
after the rain a duck
in a bomb crater

on the other side
of the battlefield someone
playing a harmonica

last night lightning
this morning the white
iris

on the bank
i wait for the river
to pass

sound of a moth
trapped in a paper lantern
summer rain

heaven and earth
knotted with a jerk
nachi falls

under cherry blossoms
female convicts in line
walk to their bath

snowy sunday
the light is beautiful
his last words

returning in time
with an umbrella wide open
and wet shoes

drizzle
patient rain over my skin
your tongue

dawn
a can of
spilled paint

after her death
watching the rain
meeting the river

back at their day jobs
the chinese astronauts
remember weightlessness

a purple tree
when did i stop
being young

i am the age
my father never was
spring planting

coyote chorus
elevator to the roof
of forgotten woods

shredding straw
and the bluebird's song
spring wind

the voice
of autumn pine woods
mourning doves

walking with the river
the water does my thinking

in shanghai
in every autumn light
a dream

distant snow capped mountains
i write a letter

alone
walking the house all night
moon festival

looking into your eyes
i forget that people die

drinking
a bowl of green tea
i stopped the war

sudden chill
an empty bird feeder
outside the nursing home

parting
her pink robe
daybreak

whales gather
at dusk
to sing

twice now
at the abandoned house
jehovah witness

my long life
never having found
a four-leaf clover

full moon
in the bum's
glass eye

parting her lips
to the dawn

ocean breeze
the names of slave ships
that no longer sail

moonlit snowflakes
floating into the cage
of the silver fox

another cross
along this stretch of road
winter fields

rain all day
i carve the darkness
from a peach

mayflies
writing their passion
on the stream

bee on a black key
i halt the metronome

winter solstice
i delete an email
from jesus

border town
all the houses with a dog
to beware of

over the parade
a window no one
looks out of

so suddenly
winter baby teeth at the bottom
of the button jar

deep winter
the sun is only
another star

tornado warning
we learn what really
matters

another summer
the butterfly still safe
under his steel pin

holding the water
held by it
the dark mud

lengthening shadow
above her eggs the hen's heart
beats against my arm

indian summer
a spent salmon
washes ashore

salmon run
does the river too
have memory

distant singing
the winter stars
almost touch

harvesting
this same field
the sickle moon

bonsai master
all the years
cut away

listening to snowfall
the strange things i can't explain
about myself

spring bloom
a young girl singing
beyond her range

autumn light
the thin thread
of honey

retreating glacier
how long since we've heard
the black wolf's song

i wonder what stones see
and hop in the shimmering
heat waves

blue apple
it gives birth
to a mirror

colors
of gardens long dead
travel toward the stars

from the starting gate
the charge of young horses
another spring

she rocks her feet
like a second heart
deep night

iron stains of roadkill
the godless month

we cannot fight them
in their languages
full of bones

as though the stars
drill holes through darkness
december

in the store window
a row of dolls
staring back

even the snail
wanders in the galaxy
evening rain

the orchid
a short poem
in spring mist

wild ducks
solid as carvings
piercing wind

from the tap
water rushes out
a-bomb day

thundering skies
wild white horses
reaching the beach

going late to sleep
curtaining the city lights
the very first snow

autumn colors
i had a flaming heart
if only once

grandfather
who built his dead sons
a grave each

five little roses
our youngest son he had just
started soccer

end of summer
the cosmos in a
handful of seeds

my ailing father
listens to the crickets
last day of august

spring thaw
the stream parts
to embrace the stone

butterflies
a child's name
set in stone

not mind nor heart
nor flesh am i
sun on the water

unknown soldier
each year bears
a poppy

spring fever
a housefly settles
as kireji

stepping off mount sumeru
i enter the ghetto

old conglomerate
filled with bright pebbles
this sadness

home from surgery
what kindness a flower is

if dry cracked soil
could let out a sigh
first snowfall

burl bark
grown into a wound
a word

return to the garden
my clausewitz copy
covered in blossoms

early dark
christmas lights color
the rain

killing fields
the wind carries a butterfly
bone over bone

winter golden
grass bent to the wind
to the ways of deer

just you
under the magnolia
in bloom

the persistence
of his image
peonies

the warmth
of the sun on his hand
in my hand

lighting butter lamps
your death anniversary
what else can i do

first light
i rise the way
mountains are made

spring moon
from the tarot deck
the fool

news of a grandchild
i touch a furled bud
in spring rain

dense fog
we built up a world
of words

pond ice
remembering swans

cello suite
taking leave
of the world

why not snail
take the load sometimes
off your back

got married
from a girl i taught
plums ripen

after all these years
ankle deep in the
other ocean

blank calendar
not only a new year
a new life

this pillar has a hole
it's a secret worth
seeing persephone

slowly
the sunset spreads
endless prairie

utterly still
the bluejay cries utterly
what i am

hitchhiking
an orange moth fills
the emptiness of texas

pregnant again
the fluttering of moths
against the window

by the night light
tiny spider's tiny web
leaving it there

sunrise
last of the cathedral
honey

give me an icicle
containing the stars
of the deep north

saw a russian film
so fat a winter carrot

sioux haiku on a relief map
mountains remind my fingers
where crazy horse tried

this scar
glass bangles
after wild dancing

orderly fields
of an amish farm the things
i can't tell her

on screens overlooking
the shinjuku station concourse
seals slithering across a floor

a pig's memory
it leads to colors
of hesitant hills

cold rain
my application to become
a crab

three times
i've said your husband
now we can just talk

dust and balloons
heal the battlefield

deep in the sea
i hold the world
with eight arms

the silence grows teeth
a tree with cracked windows

in a tent in the rain
i become a climate

forgotten for today
by the one true god
autumn mosquito

a drowning man
pulled into violet worlds
grasping hydrangea

in the dim light
i am an island picking
at a pomegranate

after rain
picking tomatoes
my medicine

clay on the wheel
i confess my faith

art deco knob
it was here
i was made

the coming storm
a cricket has hold
of the chevrolet

mask thrown aside
he puts on another
and another

attention seeking
the therapist's
cat

the grimace
of the roadside cat
its last

spring rain
i've upset the little stack
of coins

night birth
a lamb shakes fluids
into the sleet

bad day ahead
i spread honey to the far
corners of my toast

postcard from egypt
the loop in her g's

pruning roses
not earning money
not spending it

pulling gate nails
driven by my young father

coming to rest
the tossed pebble
takes a shadow

storm clouds
the valley darkens
farm by farm

blue sky
the carpenter makes
a perfect cut

pointing my way home
the starfish

out of a nightmare
all these bones
in my chest

old passport
the tug of my father's
smile

small town pantomime
the audience laughs
in the wrong place

behind her
up the hayloft
i watch my step

fireflies
my neighbor
has more

wall street gym
junior execs run
in place

slant light
to each leaf
its own fall

island in the mist
a lone figure waits
on the ferry pier

a new word needed
for each of the waves
that come in

fading blue sky
insect voices find
their rhythm

the year passes
longing for cranes
to color the sky

alone
this lake
this dragonfly

a loon calls
mosquitoes
from nowhere

spring at last
letting the stallion out
into the pasture

the sea inside
dakota wheat fields

dead end road
shadows of skinny cows
through old barbed wire

i take the road
with speed bumps
autumn leaves

twilight
the snow covered hills
stretch into night

spring snow
comforting words
to myself

the funeral
i read the verse
you read to me

parsley
so green i hear it
spring rain

kite flying day
colored squares patch the holes
in the sky

fossil fern
all that i've tried
to hold on to

night
a swan's wing
everything

like nothing ever happened
dandelion

pastel colored day
a password for the
budding willow

the hollow sound
of a playground ball
lingering light

almost dawn
in the owl's hoot
what i know of solitude

breathing on her own
furrowed fields
the color of waiting

only this
was black and white
mother's cameo

blue sky
maybe i don't need
to be right

fireflies
all the children
grown

our tour ends in rain
a fortress our ancestors
believed in

even coffin nails shine
april dusk

another friend dead
a crow flying toward the after
sunset

dry leaves in spring
a sense of urgency

red threads
in the sparrow's nest
frayed prayer flags

asylum
the darkness
of mother's hair

chill wind
a dime lands softly
in his velvet case

snorkeling
a chasm as deep
as fear

footpath
through the valley snow
secrets i knew as a child

a heron's squawk
the islands too small
for names

my apology
a finch barely breaking
the snow's crust

the cherry blossoms arrive
without a god

summer chill
a man guts sculpin
at the fish mart

summer breeze
cattle graze the floor
of an ancient sea

evening
down a road where
a car has gone

in an old bed
a devil grabbed me
by my black hair

the quiet sound
of a falling mosquito
resounds in my body

having gotten used
to the depths of war
i love a dog

on the floor
actors and masks
on the table a rose

there's really no hope
those limpid tears will cool
into blades of steel

a museum of moons
shadows on the stone

starfish
in a tide pool
soliloquy

fading day
in the blue cry of peacocks
the light of unformed things

all night rain
the tattoo of dreams

butterfly
on the flower
another flower

childhood home
i park in the shade
of my cherry stone

more than all you know
the crow

the invisible circus
forbids the clowns
to remove their make-up

a thin moon
something fluttering
is my body

a small window
filled with seasounds
it lightens

all these sounds
not one of them
a falling leaf

an owl
hoots darkness down
from the hollow oak

the blind child
reading my poem
with her fingertips

pig and i
spring rain

spring thaw
wings beating
inside my skull

dusk
from rock to rock
a waterthrush

touching the ashes
of my father

a stick goes
over the falls
at sunset

swans stir
of his breath
against my hair

lingering
on this earth
dried onions

mallards leaving
in the water
rippled sky

deep inside
the faded wood
a scarlet maple

thrush song
a few days before
the thrush

between
the piano's phrases
night wind

muzzle of the drinking cow
glides across still water

i breathe
the wind breathes
through the aspen

heading home
i return the stone
to the river

a love letter
to the butterfly gods
with strategic misspellings

rooks
weaving darkness
into the dusk

ah water strider
never to have left
a track

pain
fading the days
back to wilderness

the owl's flight
unheard stars
appear

white wind
the eyes of the dead seal
missing

night rain
a calf stands tight
by the bull

their wings
like cellophane
remember cellophane

in the otherwise still twilight
a clamor of robin wings

long stemmed roses
he's back
without his leg

refugees
the faceless presence
of innocence

wolf moon
another battalion
ships out

pearl harbor day
buried somewhere deep
in the news

the splinter
in brother's eye
his head in the wind

in the glass case
of skulls a reflection
of my own face

cloudless sky
for a second or two
world peace

the stars misaligned
burial flag

cyber bullying
even elementary school pupils
unwilling victims

beyond ideas
of right and wrong
tonight's stars

with a shredder
he talks of restoring
a broken vow

found at the bomb site
two lines of haiku

baghdad
lovers still
will be lovers

machine gun fire
she stirs more honey
in her tea

stepping into the
cockpit of a bomber
named after mom

against a correct war
what's an artist to do

paper lanterns
blue shadows on corn
snow

the patch on the soldier's vest
viet cong hunting club

vietnam war memorial
there's frankie the kid who
stole my beanie

over coffee
we talk of global warming
in a well lit cafe

roundabout
a war is a war
is a war

rehab farm
unspent shells weather
into ploughshares

hiroshima day
in my heart i release
a thousand paper cranes

small town diner
the young widow
opens her mail

stop counting syllables
start counting the dead

family heirloom
dad's tiny war journal
full of poems

auschwitz
does the wind
still howl

sultry sunrise
along the ant trail
layers of fog

opening
the tea house
my heart

little sister
a new star shines
tonight

spring festival
in this belly dancer's hips
a new blessing

on the whiteness
of my diary's
first page

new job
my predecessor's imprint
still on his chair

dawn larks
out singing
the waterfall

spring blossom
over the baby's head
a halo

first night
my baby and i breathe in
the same rhythm

the little girl
begins a new coloring
so does the spring

first wedding night
coffee boils
overnight

first spring in georgia
how frail the snowdrops

first day of school
in the almost empty bag
an apple rolls about

the first to love
starts a chorus
cricket evening

grown-up grandson
blooming in the old pot
grandma's geranium

spring
melting the ice
between us

class reunion
my first love
with two grandkids

then it's morning
and the marsh becomes
a flock of crows

morning prayers
the rising sun
between my hands

on fresh snow
a silence links
each footprint

before its flight
a bird stares straight ahead
chilly afternoon

cloudy sunrise
a yellow truck on the road
carrying the sun

morning prayer
an orchid absorbs
the sound of bees

spring cleaning
replacing old hopes
with new ones

apricot and pink
a glimpse of tomorrow
in the clouds

combing the first snow
with her eyelashes
my granddaughter

the new dog
i'm still calling it the name
of the old one

after its first flight
the young gerfalcon's talons
tighter on my glove

the first flakes of snow
drifting down on the wetlands
canada geese

false dawn
a ruffed grouse
drums the woods awake

a wild turkey
fans its tail
summer's end

spring rain
the measured step
of a sandhill crane

tan oak forest
a winter wren's warning call
near the broken sign

song sparrow
didn't know i'd missed you
all these years

red winged blackbird
defending his territory
with a song

under the eaves
a barn owl's shadow
another

power outage
a whippoorwill calls
from the tree shadows

winter chill
a sharp shinned hawk
silences the dawn

a hooded crow
pecks just outside
the penalty area

colder purple
finches flit tree to tree
not dropping a note

above the shopfront
centered amidst the turmoil
nesting barn swallow

in slow motion
the great blue heron
stalks a frog

one of the reeds
in the marsh green
backed heron

a 3rd blanket
unpacked and spread out
a carolina wren's quick note

winter loneliness
not even snow bunting tracks
in my garden

on the church steps
a mourning dove
with mother's eyes

barking
at the fisherman's dog
a herring gull

paddle at rest
beads of water slide
from the loon's bill

snow white valley
curving dark with the creek
water ouzel

riffles
a belted kingfisher
splinters the light

the passenger pigeon
returns on a cancelled stamp

golden swamp warbler
downy willow seeds flurry
around his flight

rivers to the sea
bending with the songs
of meadow larks

salt breeze
over the pickleweed
marbled godwits

end of summer
my garden in
one wheelbarrow

his wristwatch
still ticking
in the casket

how sweet the grass
how calm a place to lay
skin and bone

a skull no bigger
than my thumbnail
jasmine in bloom

transcendence
as thoreau said
one world at a time

snowing
through the blizzard
particles of me

in the curve
of your armchair
your absence

away from it all
listening for something
to listen to

ancient headstones
the names and numbers
worn to mutters

the wind shifts
a coyote's raised leg
motionless

houdini's handcuffs
and no houdini

the bird
under my ribs its wings
the way they flutter

the past sits here
shuffling a deck of cards
dealing

icy creek
a barn owl rises
out of the rime

glued by gravity
to 454 billion years

starlit lake
a stray bobber afloat
in the galaxy

the soul of a cloud
capturing it in
a butter knife

sitting in the
pale winter sun
everything breathing

mountain behind mountain
behind mountain
petals of a rose

holding the note
the way a cuckoo does
first light

ally ally in come free
down the street
my past calls

first day of school
her brother's backpack
with legs

solitaire
my widowed father
lost in the shuffle

my father
losing his memory
asks me not to forget him

childhood scrapbook
the life expectancy
of scotch tape

funeral
my grandchild tells me
i'm next

unspoken question
an old man's back

hole in my hourglass
i slip in a little more
sand

from a certain angle
my shadow casts a
full head of hair

62 candles
such beautiful memories
of things i regret

wearing the new glasses
i don't seem to hear
properly either

i wipe the mirror
the face looks even older

after 40 years
still the dreams
of being late

old pond
another floater
in my right eye

more and more
less and less
hair

shrinking
now my son
measures me

when did it start
to be about loss
christmas lights

dementia unit
the old therapy dog
remembers everyone

all the things
i said i'd do
winter sunset

spring cleaning
nowhere to put
the kids childhood

class reunion
the list a bit
shorter

train whistle
the retired conductor
checks his watch

alzheimer's ward
the faded blue number
on a resident's arm

estate sale
a jar of baby teeth
for 25 cents

all the candles
with one breath
the flame in her eyes

palmist
reading the lines
in her face

summer heat
i take away dad's
car keys

visiting mother
again she finds
my first gray hair

dawn
the shadows once more
are mountains

late snow
the sopping wet shoes
beside the fireplace

quiet street
the sound of cutlery
on plates

old woman
in her begging bowl
only orange blossoms

at each turn
of the merry-go-round
my father saying goodbye

between the pines
only a dry path
where the sun is

all of a sudden
they're maple the leaves that fall
beside the river path

clumps of mud
on the dark path
toads leap

the scorpion coming out
of its position in between
a parenthesis
and an inquisition

having rained last night
it has its voice refreshed
the river

each pine a ghost
this moonlit night

hazy dawn
the swallows awoke
in another world

dreaming
in the dream the heron
in the cottonfield

pink sky
wee things in the mountain range
turn on their lights

in the pond
eternity moves
for an instant

sea breeze
the fisherman's shadow
changes rock

still warm
the spot left by the cat
autumn afternoon

on the other shore
two strangers under
an umbrella

hanging out the washing
the first stars between
the clothes pegs

waiting room
a sigh in sync
with her fan

another blackout
how deep her wrinkles
beside the fire

remembering
the child not born
such an immense plain

the breeze gives the pine
its voice as the dawn
to the nightingale

in the bathtub
i submerge the nostalgia
of your embraces

i think that you
no longer think that
i drink your light

in the net
the fish still moving
on the sand

may my heart be for you
the moon over the water
and the cherry tree in bloom

fluttering
on the platform of the metro
the butterfly

the blackbird dead
and its yellow beak
still yellow

hints of autumn
at last the hour has come
to board the train

morning thunder
i pause even though
i'm late

schoolyard fence
when did i end up
on this side

taking a left
when i should have gone right
spring drizzle

perhaps next year
she says
autumn mist

a coleman lantern
lighting the compromise
quarter moon

smiles in passing
our lives touch
just this once

spicy chicken
this impulse to ask
if she's married

for a second there
i thought i had the answer
fireflies

first date
he tells me there's an app
for the moon

not loving you
until the butterfly
on your knee

moose tracks
after all this time
i ask you out

not the answer
i was expecting
heat haze

blue sky day
the way that little girl skipped
when her mum said yes

mother at the end
ends a silence
of who i am

two of us sharing
this table strangers
in a foreign land

asking him to stay
snow turns to sleet
then to rain

i started seeing
leaving myself behind
as i walked

a back road
and a flat tire
the peach blossoms

the planets aligning
i rearrange my night

a small adjustment
to stay en route
sunlit pines

tidal shift
flowers from my
daughter in law

costume party
another chance
at myself

winter stars
our meeting
unarranged

the poker player
twists his ring
starry night

blackout
nothing between me
and the night

bare hedge
banked with snow
i accept

amazing grace
the plainest cuttings
the loveliest

baptism song
a turtle slips
into the river

communion wafer
in my open hand
the fragrance of lilies

rolling up his sleeves
the monk prepares
to read the gospel

reading the psalms
path to the water

epiphany
all that i long for
in one star

lord's prayer
a slight tremor
in my father's hand

broken for you
the snap of the host
in my palm

raspberry paczki
from one day to the next
this sinner's heart

for lent
giving up
lentils

my palsied mother
pressing my forehead on hers
this ash wednesday

easter morning
the new-born turtles
race to the sea

outdoor service
the sun's reflection
on the bread plate

easter sunrise
tarnished cross
in my jewelry box

a white rose blooms
through the broken fence
easter morning

easter
at the priest's waist
so many keys

church bells
the rabbi wakes
for fishing

hiding eggs
in the backyard
stone rolls aside

the firefly you caught
lights the church you make
with your hands

no buds yet
but colored eggs hang
from the tulip tree

easter eve
our campfire rises
to the stars

lord's supper
my heartbeat
in the wine

palm sunday
the cherry blossoms
have yet to fall

palm sunday
the sound of a frond
ripping

laundry line
prayer shawls dovaning
in the spring breeze

dabbing the wine
onto the seder plate
the sweetness on my finger

passover seder
the candlelight flickering
in grandmother's silver

making the blessing
over the plum blossoms
passover night

at dawn
the first day of the week
an acorn shell

autumn dusk
a word that will do
for the one i can't find

diaper change
the haiku i had in mind
wiped clean

deadline approaches
my nose drips
faster

writer's block
the first kernel of popcorn
turns inside out

haiku editor
glimpses of the world
in each day's mail

all day writing poems
the sound of paper
settling in the bin

fingers poised
above the keyboard
spring rain

staring
at a sheet of paper
a night without words

pacific shore
my poem is folded
into a boat

no paper
i write a haiku
on a shell

writer's block
another new year's
resolution

haiku
written on the fly
draws a few

all the poems
i've written
melting snow

haiku in the wind
i search for the right words
as a hawk dives and lifts

meditating
the haiku moment
passes

the way that ladybug
wanders into my poem

sugar moon
so many poems
in need of love

looking up rules
of punctuation
the green hills

haiku on the back
of a torn envelope
your last letter

bats swirling
across the prairie
ink stained desk

forcing a poem
its petals all
over the ground

first sun in days
let the haiku
write itself

haiku by candlelight
the slow gurgle of rain
in the gutter

my favorite jeans
scraps of haiku
in the old pockets

japanese bullet train
too fast for a
haiku moment

twittering sparrows
children counting syllables
with both hands

haiku void
a monarch poised
over lemon blossoms

quarter moon
i edit a haiku
down to size

hot summer day
over cold cherries my son
asks is this haiku

autumn sunset
the wake of a tugboat
sloshes ashore

wind in the pines
i reach past
my fingertips

wild iris
the blazed trail stops
short of the meadow

goldenrod
and in the distance
mountains

climbing in shadow
the canyon rim
brightly lit

childhood home
my climbing tree's
phantom limbs

hope
without knowing what for
autumn colors

snow angels
almost invisible
under new snow

the sound of bells
wishing i believed
in something

ash wednesday
as i dust the piano
faint notes

pachelbel
i drive on past
my destination

night kayaking
never quite reaching
the moon

writing at my desk
i look out across the sea
words slip their moorings

squatter's shack
fireflies rise
from the bush

faint stars
the flapping of canvas
on a grape truck

a curtain billows
before the rain
scent of roses

sunlight through the thin
white blouse she holds up
folds and puts away

swallow flight
looking out the window
long after

ebb tide
the shell i keep reaching for
carried further away

summer's end
the ice cream van
plays greensleeves

childhood home
twilight as i
arrive

on the bathroom hamper
morning sunlight fills
the sails of a toy boat

migrating geese
the canoe pulls
at its rope

night curtain
the autumn moonlight
finds a small tear

goldenrod fields
the rags of curtains
blowing in the wind

passing clouds
only a stand of aspen
is in light

a forever stamp
on a letter to
the ocean

yearning for kyoto
even in kyoto
call of the cuckoo

morning hush
the fisherman casts a thread
of sunlight

lure fishing
to catch her before
reincarnation

old enough
to just listen
trout rising

early morning
fishermen tell stories
waiting for the tide

autumn deepens
a fish slides down
the cormorant's throat

baiting one fish
with another
autumn dawn

catch and release
a little shine left
on my fingers

a fishing fleet
hanging in the clouds
the spring horizon

fishing
with dad again
the ripples

evening calm
the fisherman's
smoke rings

two lines in the water
not a word between
father and son

a salmon leaps
grandpa starts to sing
with a brogue

sun-green water
beyond the algae
the shapes of fish

opening day
the drift of conversation
along the trout stream

almost breakfast time
fumbling in the coffee can
for a nightcrawler

cleaning trout
in the late day heat
blood beneath his nails

the hooked
fish's last gasp
its eye on me

father daughter talk
my fishing lure caught
in the moon

distant thunder
a fish's tail
slaps his arm

pan-fried trout
i learn something new
about my father

fine spring rain
the jerk of a fishing line
through the river mist

the last light
glints off a mayfly
off a trout

casting into a pool
from the center of himself
fly fisherman

winter moon
the fisherman warm
with whiskey

winter stars
the fishing holes
left behind

a tangled nest
of fishing line
spring birdsong

fish
jumping all night
shooting stars

skinning squid
the deep tanned hands
of the fisherman

a keeper moon
the old fisherman
lets out more line

day lilies
opening to
acid rain

balmy evening
leaving work
the doctor says ah

text message
the suddenness
of black ice

cloudburst
the sound of raindrops
changing size

cloudburst
bare chested with a
little sake cup

cold front
the honey jar
releases its lid

distant thunder
my son is now
one hour late

distant thunder
the cicada throbs
in my hand

people coming out
with and without umbrellas
a double rainbow

first warm day
two left gloves
for gardening

first warm day
torn caution tape
at the trailhead

ground fog
up to my ankles
in moonlight

ground fog
a doe's head
lifts above it

gale warning
two gulls surf the waves
above the lake

hard frost
pigeons peck at
chicken bones

the sparrow flying
with legs dangling down
the heat

heat lightning
the buckle end
of the belt

ice storm
he traces my scars
in the dark

rain clouds
the bulging calyx
of the new rose

sheet lightning
the face near the top
of the ferris wheel

between telephone calls
the snow drifts off from
the rest of my life

snow mixes with rain
my mother keeps calling me
by my brother's name

record storm surge
the beach lined with
oily murres

first spring wash
colors from the sundog
bleed through a cloud

a warm breeze
the scent of hay bales
from the moonlit field

the pulse
in a knot of spiderlings
warm breeze

no wind
the chrysalis
trembles

passing ants
touch antennae
i travel alone

church cemetery
a wasp starts its nest
in mary's hand

she lifts one child
the underwater years
of dragonflies

capturing a butterfly
the american in me

returning body bags
my dna in a
mosquito

dog shit or me
the fly doesn't care

word of his death
bees streaming out of a hole
in my dictionary

an ant carries
more than its weight
morning prayer

water strider
i still don't believe
in miracles

just enough
to leave an impression
firefly

watching butterflies
the two sides
of my brain

a new hearing aid
adjusting it she tunes in
on crickets

night spiders
armed with red pens

the smell of a crushed beetle
the things that don't change

white butterfly
i'm also ready
to surrender

father asks
if it's time to go
cricket song

more thunder
ants do ant things
to the peonies

potluck picnic
we each bring our own
swarm of gnats

the war awakens
the face of an insect
in the mirror

her side of the argument
ants spill out of
the prodded lizard

his latest lies
eye to eye with a
praying mantis

power failure
a deathwatch beetle
clicks in the wall

a mosquito
caught in my hair
scent of pine

dark of the moon
the flavor of the hive
in the honey

incense drifts
during high mass
someone's sneeze blessed

hydrangea rain
will i see you again
in my dreams

spring moon
this year one more star
in the milky way

after the brushstroke
his head stays tilted
to a sun-dappled sumie

my friend's death
day tea drunk from a
galah mug she gave me

his death notice
the get well card still
in my briefcase

intrepid hiker
he strides away
to climb the snout

on the last page
of her last book
the setting sun

lowering sun
with a turn of my head
the finches fly away

dragonfly
where have you flown off to
first frost

how brittle the spine
of the blue feather found
in his book

voice of a dark thrush
lingers in the cedars
nikko in mist

feathers in the fire
a cardinal's song
between thunderclaps

sundown
the mason jars
empty again

news of her death
winter moon descending
beyond the trees

swallowtail
weeds in bloom
about st francis

near a white stone
a bonsai garden
in their memory

funeral service
behind the high church windows
a mast passes by

sweet magnolia
spanish moss leans
with the breeze

for her this spring
the greengoing woods
still greening

obituary
i never knew
you loved dahlias

snowmelt
waters a blush
of spring flowers

no longer hearsay
finally official
death notice of renge

finally united
with your snow leopard
flutter of prayer flags

ripples spreading out
now only moonlight remains
on the turtle stone

at the pearly gates
st peter says with a wink
not quite

remembering her face
in the face of the swan

gone from the woods
the bird i knew
by song alone

holding the sea shell
next to my ear
his voice from afar

first snowflakes
drinking mulled wine
with a cat in her lap

march morning
the crackling puddles
of air

fortune teller
the lights of a distant train
shimmer on the rails

walking on leaves
the road and the road ditch
all one

greasy spoon
i imagine the waitress
without her acne

pea soup fog
ahead of me a revenant
who whistles

elbowed by that north wind
i step aside and see it
fling the lark skyward

hunger moon
the model returns to her
circle of chalk

gun talk in the store
i bought another paintbrush
to color flowers

sea fog
the place on the sea wall
where the suicides go

the undiscovered country
a cereal box full
of cupboard moths

twilight shadows
the outline of a child
in sidewalk chalk

summer's heat
the shrapnel of
a human being

the cat's teeth
dribble oriole blood
spring equinox

night fishing in a starlit creek
the depth of the galaxy
around my ankles

a yowling stray
the saucer of milk
iced over

taxi stand
the man in a rabbit suit
fumbles for his watch

raining shadows
the spring moon
between heartbeats

longest night
a box of tiny limbs
beneath her bed

distant thunder
a streak of blue
on the blackbird's wing

beneath continents
of slow moving algae
my alcoholic father

humpback moon
in a half built scraper
a light flickers on and on

dad's suicide
a candle burns away
its shadow

summer heat
baby at her bare breast
in the checkout line

red moon
their father's hash pipe
between them

shoreline
the translucent sunset
of a child

wild-eyed child
figuring out
the roadkill

she shows me
the cuts on her arms
sickle moon

passing storm
the moon caught
in a spider's web

steady drip
a bucket's tone
rising with the sap

so much sparrow song
in the shape of a bush
falling snow

the big dipper
rows of corn connect
farm to farm

starless night
the first bite
of black bread

northern lights shimmer
a saw-whet piping
on the distant shore

nightfall
a woodcock belts between
betelgeuse and rigel

entering perseids
barred owl fledglings
beg to be fed

your cold hands
those first stars
were already there

desert chill
the ocotillo's long reach
to the stars

the old oak
that filled our summer
filled with stars

moonless night
my reclusive neighbor
points out jupiter

backyard fireflies
each moment a different
constellation

a smear of stars
from horizon to horizon
the loon's necklace

shooting star
abruptly the campfire
rekindles itself

letting the dog out
the stars out

long view to sirius
even the past
isn't past

night clouds
gone the supply
of infinity

leonids
the sparkle
in her laugh

deep winter stars
between the stars
i know

walking the dogs
over the snowy fields
orion

starry night
what's left of my life
is enough

stars
before letting go
letting go

he removes his glove
to point out orion

starry night
i break into a run

tide's far sound
the stars have come in again
to lie among the stones

part of the galaxy
has gone into the dip
and veer of the sea

far into twilight
milkweed seeds cross the meadow
the evening star

strange voices
i open the door
to the stars

she lifts her head
a tapping at the window
is only rain

rain
opening the window
a light heart

a south wind
polishing my face clean
for this journey

spring winds
the old lady tries again
to tidy her hair

spring mists
on these long evenings
someone's coming

an unknown boat
coming into the harbor
touches me

walking to work
our sleeves touch
starch on silk

asking for a ride
his answer dotted
with music

static electricity
garbled introductions
they lean together

panty hose
she crosses her legs
with whispers

woman and her pillow
curled around a notebook
dawn's first light

light
imprinting the stone
rings

as one of us
the child watches
an earthworm

warm under quilts
the young couple lie quiet
in the place of one

rain drops
falling around the bed
her hair pins

his body a bow
his arrow shot me
full of flowers

spring storms
at their climax
thunder rolls away

rain shower
afterwards he reads to me
all of his poems

eyes
into eyes
lights

after lovemaking
all is quiet until
rain begins again

a woman's cry
the shower begins
with lightning

orgasm
an explosion of flowers
in wind chimes

tangled in sleep
on a sea weed strewn beach
lovers

flooded river
sides flowing together
lovers touch

dripping
spring rain and your body
in mine

driftwood lair
lovers hidden from view
found by the wind

lying in a river
words of love
in the current

rain
idle fingers strumming
the dulcimer

one ear
listening to the river
wet with rain

rain dripping
one hour
into another

these long days
watching the sky fade
with closed eyes

river winds
flipping white pages
without poems

rain erases time
one hour reused
the whole day long

in this rain my house
a stone in the stream
i a female fossil

scattered
among driftwood
drifters

touching his face
the slope of her forehead
echoes

new friends meet
snow-melt streams
into the river

walking
the river comes
along too

meeting an old friend
at the mountain stream
a bear

silence
around lovers
a silver cord

lovers in church
giggling at the term
immaculate

afternoon rain
into my sleep
your pencil moves

book covers
renewing a friendship
somewhat faded

clipboard
unable to tell
your poem from mine

daybreak
the person you love
is not perfect

without love
sea kelp growing
a holdfast

alone
but not alone
the sun  the moon

so easy to love
yet she always fumbles
locks and keys

organ drone
mother's warning
about choirboys

rain complaining
of the steepness of the lane
to his lover's house

parting
at the river
weeping willows

unwanted child
wearing a name
that doesn't fit

crying at dawn
gulls
and a lonely woman

morning fog
dreams not buried
deep enough

spring sunshine
the strangeness of his perfectly
normal thumbnail

sunny sea winds
shoulders ache
for the want of wings

kids laughing
in the neighbor's house
the childless couple

moonlight moving
with the gate as the servant girl
takes an evening

unemployed carpenter
l-o-v-e
tattooed on his knuckles

saturday rain
the desire to buy something
extravagant

saturday rain
desire by a warm stove
for an affair

static electricity
a silken sleeve is drawn
to the amber

white surf
wanting to keep the ocean
free of oil wells

waterfall
delicate forms
for a spirit

buying
scotch magic tape
as it were

dinosaur claws
taken to a rocky beach
a dreaming mind

ballet movies
all night her dreams
tip-toe

dreaming i was
the sleeve of your coat
i learned your secret

acrobat family
mine  if i ran away
to the circus

roar of the surf
sleeping on the beach
a child dreams

napping
among driftwood logs
sleeping

awakening
furniture
with chipped veneers

up and down
driftwood lairs of lovers
come and go

tide pool still
as if it is tomorrow
i'm not here

fading
condolence cards
the sting

sea spray
a rock writes
another name

spirals
the world tied together
with double helixes

a watch
left out in the rain
timeless

three fingertips
pressed to a cheek telling
of a new love affair

tide turns
leaping white into the cove
our eyes

raindrops
in a waterfall
glory-rush

surf's surge and boom
brushing my teeth
in a stranger's bathroom

each white wave
mounts the black rock
differently

waves crash
in the trickling away
another crests

hour by hour
the wave-white sea
becomes the wind

spring run-off
a little more  a little less
humans get so excited

waist
long-gone encircles
a child

rented house
the ocean's roar
in mother's womb

tugging at my sleeve
the a wind a voice
saying mommy!

the widow
taking swimming lessons
from the life guard

on a bridge
a young couple discuss
old lovers

nest
the fullness of spring
with eggs

lunch
time by the brook
spring-fed

always further
down the road frogs
and the dark

on the long pier
a tall father tells his son
how deep the ocean is

winds on the beach
going inland to remind you
of my love

thin and pale
the air of spring
leaving in flowers

smooth seas
upon jagged shores
the power

a love affair
building a fire
in a strange stove

the new couple
one looks upstream
the other down

dropping sticks
in the flooded river
their fortune

rivers
taking care of us
small fishes

earth
each spot layered
with stories

sunshine
on the hobo's back
hitchhiking

song
from a fence post
meadow lark

the night is shortened
by your letters on the pillow
here beside me

coming together
your nearness
my music

the road before us
departing clouds bright
with a rising sun

so much rain
this year how the kids
have grown

turning green
each wave crests
higher than the last

thunder
his first date
not hers

spring rain
your gentleness seems to know
no sorrow

to off-shore rocks
spring comes rowing
lovers in a boat

parents
showing the newborn
to the rising sun

lips
take from the springs
whistling

cut crystal rainbow
shining where he wanted
to touch her

warming
her feelings of love
the hot springs

ducks
paddling around
lovers

invisible thrusting
the mountain raises
all of us

flooded river
rubbing low skies
electric current

a woman's slit
sliding over granite
a spring

spring
the urge to scratch
the earth with a hoe

randy again
her voice on the phone says
he wants me

treasured gift
her smooth stone calls
as the phone rings

gentle breathing
night rain comes alive
tapping on the window

society dame
flirts with an unreal cowboy
her teenage romance

dawn's faint hour
awakens under closed eyes
a shiver of pictures

desiring you
rain drums
in my ears

love duet
everyone in the music class
crosses their legs

pearl buttons
undoing her blouse
two soft ones

patterns
your words open
the iris

tumbling surf
water voices of children
within the womb

heavy surf
that sound i heard before
being born

soft things
inheriting a pattern
in time

desert wind
naked as the crack
where i was born

silence
baby's blue eyes
without tears

fingerprints
the tiny scars
for life

lying in your lap
the dense smell of musk
a birthday gift

the poise of coming
forward waves on a beach
a baby's first steps

this need to love
mountains give to spring
flowers

downpour
your fingers
inside me

sun setting
emerald waves free
our passion

illuminated
in the light from the barn
their first kiss

rain
pounding in love
all night

rain on the roof
wet around us
on the sheets

kisses
in your open mouth
the rest of you

in and out
of the river's mouth
a tongue of sea

opening my legs
to the flooded river
currents meet

jerking off
the love scene played
by marionettes

deep humming
waves unrolling
the bay

relaxed
cherry flowers unfold
peace

across the fence
with his cherry in bloom
i can forgive him

planting peas
a harvest today
of peace

asleep
morning seas quiet
pink

raised up
within the protection
a mountain unfolding

a touch of silk
caressing her body
glistening sperm

vacation
utterly exhausted
by pleasure

local flirt
two pair of wool socks
below a backless dress

standing still
his glance begins
the dance

silence
between eyes
love lights

her hem
the wind lifts
a little fog

giving him
a bite of her
oldest apple tree
for marlene mountain

deep sea green waters
sheltered by a cove slipping
into something frothy

rented house
rows of ocean waves
seem unfaithful

a strange house
the new nightgown
seems unfaithful

a young girl
chewing gum in conversation
with herself

river childhood
banging a bucket
boat sides

tea house
a child feds the koi fish
his fortune

how proudly it waves
the american flag t-shirt
on her young breasts

wet dreams
the man in the moon
was once young

young poet gives
to jane his book of poems
for maggy with love

no april fools
these crocus buds closed
against the snow

the guru speaks
evening steals upon us
with wide-open eyes

stained glass
above the baptismal font
a babe spotted red

canning jars
overflowing among the graves
roses

easter bunny
leaving a basket
of kittens

easter monday
finding a solid chocolate egg
under fake grass

earth day
my pencil bounces
as a tree falls

high mountain village
church organ reedy as willows
the noisy brook

telephone call
the addressed easter card|
not to be sent

easter morning mountain
my shadow crosses
death valley

hikers arrive
in cathedral canyon

after the storm
a sunny easter morning
finds opals

atheists' vacation

in death valley

gift-wrapping popcorn
for father's day

she mows the lawn
and whistles

good friday
buying easter candy
the second time

graduation day
sweat and mothballs
grass so green

graduation
where green banners wave
grass grows long

graduation night
the owl printed on a balloon
seems the wisest

gun salute
from a hilltop monastery
monks chanting

religion
on the remote coast
buoy bells

may day
removing her wedding band
the last cloud

memorial day
so many flowers broken off
on the ground

memorial day
wild flowers overpower
the flags

cloudy
a crowded sky
memorial day

memorial day
the passion flower opens
wholeheartedly

memorial day
the honored guests slept
through the parade

mother's day
giving the old cat
a dish of cream

mother's day
the daughter's call
about her divorce

from mexico

all of her flowers bloom
along the road

the photo of her
afternoon

mother's day
give-away puppies escaping
the banana box

mother's day
seaside restaurant special
crab balls

wearing of the green
for a real irishman
a black and blue eye

during the hailstorm
the stuffed easter rabbit
clutched in her arms

last day of frost
buying the bride
a bread box

rehearsing vows
in the middle of the night
frogs

honeymooners
boats in the harbor
anchored together

smiles leaving
her bridal jitters
at the altar

fibers
so fine mornings
green the air

before it comes
the knowing of rain
in the air

sea air
each cell fills
with salt water

morning air
tightly rolled
in her curlers

morning breeze
in the flooded river saying
find a spring green stone

morning breeze
coming in the window
surf sounds

clouds
the sky divided
into puddles

waves
churning up high
clouds

clouds
touching the sea
with rain

free to fly
some of the ocean
in wind-driven colors

wispy clouds
splashed across the sky
sea foam

a point of land
breaking through the clouds
sunshine

pines
under great white mountains
clouds

changing forms
all around the buddha
clouds in a blue sky

clouds
flooding the river
with spring

spring cloud melt
flooding river willows
green leaves

journeying
spring clouds blow over
packed suitcases

rolling down
rounded ridges
rain clouds

a cloudy day
the silky softness
of fresh-washed hair

spring winds
between the tops of bent grass
bottoms of clouds

silence
in high winds a cloud
turns around

wispy clouds
a white-water view
of the sky

the pyramid
morning fog and sun
slanted by redwoods

treetops green
leaving in fog
clean blue

a winter heart
flying into spring
low clouds and fog

sunrise
pouring into the valley
fog

cliff side
the edge of fog
bright green

step by step
a hole in the fog
walking away

moon radiance
filling the river valley
fog

sea fog
darken the trampled grass
beach path at dawn

on the green hill
piles of dark clouds
full of hailstones

after lovemaking
hail falls between us
she buttons her blouse

a hazy moon
pinpointed by the lights
of fishing boats

silence
wafted by light
many colors

a range of light
morning colors flow
out of the high sierras

morning light
the sound of waves
on your sleeping face

without lights
the brightness of a blue sky
full of stars

dawn's faint hour
squeezes in heart-run veins
light in every limb

light touching
where only rain goes
trespassing

tides
light comes and goes
as ocean

first light
the cove still dark
with low tide

dawn light
rocks and water
full of fire

wings of dawn
birds unfolding
the light

the dark moon
pulls out of the ridge
morning light

stars bend down
morning seas light
dawn

ocean so wide
and weighty
yet dancing with light

sunrise
out of two feet comes eight
foot long shadows

crack of dawn
the thin line
of birds peeping

curving an ember
of a not space place
crack of dawn

morning waves
to burnished water
a radiance

ancient cypress
leaning over the light
at sunrise

morning bright
meets cabin cold
on quilted mountains

as is the dark
without the sound of rain
the room grows cold

april weather
all the changes
leave us cold

spring presses
cold into shadow
shapes

curve of the sea
cupping her breasts
cold hands

still cold
spoons in the sandbox
all empty

shining glass
of unlit kerosene lamps
this long evening

expanding the warmth
the yellow flowers
of longer days

old snow
soften by bird song
a longer day

a long day
unfolding rock crevices
with light

the long day
holding my eyes
against the sky

rocks give way
morning light rolls over
eastern peaks

morning
drawing lines on the sea
one for the horizon

morning
wetted by the light splash
of small waves

morning
side of the mountain
awake

early morning
the weight of paper
waiting for poems

ocean terrace
lifting to the north born fog
morning

morning light
dreams climb the dark wall
of the obelisk

yawning
sea fog in the valley
rolls into morning

morning sun
pulled over the ridge
by sleepy eyes

morning sun
coming down the cliff
the ocean night

morning fire
blazed forth at last
sun through the fog

a morning moon
your face in sleep
turned to the wall

a calm sea
refusing to accept
the morning moon

balanced at dawn
a full moon slides into the sea
without ripples

too perfect
the day moon rises
from snow capped peaks

wild surf
tears in the night
a tender new moon

morning
a touch of sea waves
and the moon melts

sea light
filling the valleys
with mist

moving against mist
crumbles from the cliff
stream down

pink misty mountains
gather between the peaks
the rising sun

morning mist
filling the spaces
of night birds

lacking a redness
the gray mist of morning
not yet an argument

mists
leaving the lake
high

fire angels
river mists at dawn
manifest

ocean roar
at the open window
a breath of mist

mist
softens the hills
incoming waves

passing of spring
water trickles over rock
into the koi pond

a wooden gate
the sky begins to crumble
the upright posts

narrow brook
in pouring rain
the smallness

rain
falling in the brook
once again

salt shaker
in dawn's pearly light
the pouring rain

in this rain my house
a stone in the stream
i a female fossil

march rains
filling the zodiac
with fish

running from the hill
the haste of rain water
in twisted paths

tops of waves
on mountain ridges
rain

such a rain!
changing into
a clean nightgown

falling
with the rain
into bed

rain
coming to the wakeful
sleep sounds

waves
wind flowing over mountains
in rain

a sound falling
in the night bird feathers
spring rain

falling
the amount of rain
in a haiku

sky waters
young between trees
on a high wind

spring rain
the night sound
of bird feathers

after the storm
a thing in the dark
somewhere drips

rain clouds
the tide turns
small ripples

a rippled pool
a rain cloud falling
into the sea

round puddle
in spaces between raindrops
circles

edge of the roof
raindrops dripping off
seconds of the night

raindrops
drowning in the pool
rings as tombs

raindrops
wetting rocks dried
by low tide

spindrift
the setting sun
in a rainbow

segments
morning rainbows
in a wet net

clouds
drifting into sea foam
rainbows

rainbridge
crossing the river
rainbow

after a shower
stars also shine
brighter

may showers
the wind so gentle
rain is round

april showers
your sticky diamonds
dry on my leg

a white wave breaks
in the death of tumult
a rainbow

morning faces
ocean and sky
soften pink

waves breaking
a paler blue washes
across the sky

line of mountains
stretching the eye
a clear sky

for the maiden dance
light fluffy flakes
of april snow

snow mixing
my breath
with spring

a morning moon
nearly touching venus
with my finger

darkness
dawn light enters
filled with stars

faithful till sunrise
of all the heavenly lights
only the morning star

morning stars
alone with me
the beach

morning stars
the call of the sea
over the dunes

in the morning sun
thousands of night stars
still in the dew

still a few stars
as if they will stay
all morning

in the marrow
of my own bones
a morning star

forest clearing
a circle of stars
spinning out

sunshine
making light of it
salt water wave

opening the cave
the morning sun
slips in

filling the bay
an incoming tide
of sunshine

silence
in a rain shower
sunshine

in spring sunshine
around the granite stones
spaces green

sunlight
in a slurp of coffee
sunday morning

on the far ridge
an arch of fire burns
into sunday

morning sun
creeping from up to down
in the sleeping holes

sunrise
coming thru the mountain pass
a yellow line

ocean sunrise
the colors of a grandson
running on the beach

sunrise
slipping into view
bird songs

the sun rises
petting a yellow cat
with warmth

walking east
drawn to that place
the sun rises

sun rise
giving me a new name
and a shadow

first day of spring
on the calendar
by the snowy window

rising from earth
the spring equinox moon
grows round

desert springs hot tub
the canyon rim warms
with spring's first dawn

spring equinox
fitting into winter
a saucer and cup

double helix
earth hangs
in a woven net

coming inside
spring wind has filled
my pockets with cold

wind
rubbing the lake
the wrong way

sea winds
smells diluted by distance
flow thin as light

lace curtains
whipped by spring winds
billows of clouds

cloud wind
blowing colors in and out
of the ocean

high winds
memories
of flight

stars bend down
into the wind of whitecaps
morning light

no trespassing sign
torn down by spring winds
the open sky road

a south wind
ironing work shirts on the line
at thirty knots an hour

a wide beach
the many suns
of foam

beach diamonds
a new day crystallized
in sunny surf foam

beach logs
bleached silver
beach rain

incoming waves
unroll a foamy carpet
of gray skies

spring
unrolling on the beach
a great white roar

morning
especially high on the beach
sleeper waves

lost sleep
in a babbling brook
loud as the cold

all the noise
of spring-flooded stream
bright green

forgotten brook
running the centuries down
locked in rock

jagged cliffs
falling water torn to shreds
smooths rocks

sea cliffs touch
soft edges of water
nights

black winds
the moonless earth
deeply plowed

wheels of water
rims rolling all night
the spring flood

spring rains
swirling flooded waters
driftwood

flood waters
spreading valley to valley
mud

clouds
flooding the river
bubble sounds

spring floods
the river valley
in high spirits

cloud sound
the river flooded
without a duck

bridging
the flooded river
my fears

up-canyon winds
rushing flood waters
the wrong way

carried along
with the flooded river
muddy thoughts

white pussy willows
above a muddy swollen river
fat raindrops

flood waters
filling on a deserted island
a wine bottle

spring
comes to the river
flooded

drop by drop
the river floods

glub glub
the flooded river
drinking stones

all the noise
of a spring-flooded river
back in the wind

spring floods
the river valley
up to my toes

spring floods
grasses on a high hill
lowered

swollen stream
flowing sideways
into fence rows

blue into blue
flood waters rise
in a pool of iris

rising flood waters
tonight's moon is less
than yesterday's

flooded delta
in the rocks
many cracks

eventide
desert mountains flooded
with pink

desert sounds
out of the sun
clouds moving

rippling grass
wind moves up the hill
light waves

coastal hills
from curling waves
a new green

hill rise
trees lending themselves
to the land

high tides
sea mists in coastal hills
new green grass

blue veils
badly wrinkled  barely smoothed
rows of coastal hills

surf rolling
morning sunshine
into green hills

coast hills
one dark rainstorm leaves
a green shimmer

the spring lake
rising up to sit
on the bench

ripples
the lake ear listening
to us

skystone
dropped by a mesa
a light shine

after the storm
small waves on sea meadows
meek sheep

flute melodies
across green ocean waves
spring meadows

the bones the stones
the last snow melts
again a river

coming between trees
slanted sunshine rivulets
melting snow

soul shape
between soft evening peaks
a valley cradle

coastal mountains
catching the rain clouds
wet slopes

rising at 600 am
a wobbly blue line
of distant mountains

morning air
the mountain smells
as if it had slept

up the mountain
on the yellow line
someone goes down

mountains
folding into a valley
bird wings

sunshine on
the way to your house
a muddy road

desert oasis
finding in the water
more o sounds

trickle
life in a granite wall
water

floating clouds
down from the mountain
a puddle of rain

in mud puddles
in a strange sky over
a stranger land

rain drops
in a puddle crowns
of light jewels

skystone
rounding the matrix
a puddle

in puddles
the pattern of raindrops
dyes the hills green

light
winding through the forest
a river

rocks twist
the river smoothes
each one

evening skies
dark comes to the river
cloudless

light
drawing in the river
boulders

low clouds
squeezing earth
into a river

streaming in
morning light electrifies
the river

river wind
from valley to mountain top
dampness

after the shower
the smell of pine soap
in the forest

pencil
a color of trees
wet with rain

river sound
its shape moving
one

a bright eye
following the light wood
carried by the river

seeping
between rocks a river
begins nameless

tumbling
wood at high tide
into a river

river valley
letting the sunrise
into the sea

rain
the river beginning
on the roof

amber clouds
in skies shallow with rain
a moving stream

along with the rain
going down the mountain
to the sea

rivers
converging
raindrops

clean bright blue
redwood shadows
on a muddy river

wind in pines
rushing to the river
rain

clouds
hanging around the river
rain drop spirits

sunshine
in the mud-yellow river
rain

spring rain
a dance with tiny steps
tree roots growing

playfully tossing
river smooth stones
spring run-off

spring run-off
leaping into the sky
falls

spring run-off
down the face of the rock
jagged joy

escaping
a moan from the banks
spring run-off

in the beginning
before we awake
there's the ocean

daylight
leaping out of dark seas
a wave

heaving seas at dawn
you breath as lightly
as the sky

refreshed by sleep
morning seas
calm and clear

the face of morning
sky shining on the ocean
a blush of pink

land breezes
gentled by rolling
hills to the sea

morning sun
finding off shore rocks
yet another one

waving every wave
the ocean wild
as early spring

surf sounds
wall to the outer world
pale green and white

the bay
curving into the sea
spring

wide ocean
ending in little waves
covers bare toes

dawn
the moon with me
sinks into the sea

morning
coming from the night
the flat ocean

underfoot
the ocean rearranges
its rocks

morning mild
waves bring to the shore
misty sunlight

undercurrents
surf roar to vivaldi
on tape

spinning around
the earth curls
each row of waves

spring waves
curled water
coming unrolled

into the cove
a big wave brings
a bit of sun

gathering energy
a wave rises up
in me

weaver winds
the white world of waves
spinning

mountain spring
a damp breathing
from a rock

lips
sucking from the spring
a life sound

rocky spring
lips taking a sip
from lips

taking from the spring
words of praise
holy water

many days of rain
the ocean at high tide
covers it all

tide turning
around rocks
around the sea

low tide
a giant wave still fills
the narrow gorge

a month of rain
low tide returns to us
a favorite beach

low-tide rocks
resting on the ocean's bottom
this morning

hearing secrets
a low tide whispers
about the rocks

pale green
the ocean's bottom
at low tide

low-tide rocks
the sun in a rack of clouds
far out at sea

deep enough
the ocean covers a rock
with small white waves

sea caves
hollow at low tide
buoy bells

whispers
rising up to come ashore
transparent waves

emerald pools
the color of sleep
at low tide

incoming tide
wets small rocks
each with time

pulled from sleep
spring high tides
crash and roar

magic light
shining from rocks
tide pool

opal light
glancing from salt
waves

land shaped
by the heavy blue wind
underwater

mountain stream
sparkling waterfalls
washed by snow

falling wind
water catches sunlight
in white plumes

water
exploded from living rock
falls

tear wet
the tiny waterfall
no one photographs

canyon walls
slide into the valley
water sounds

water smoke
rising up the waterfall
rainbows

a shower of light
over the canyon rim
a waterfall

river bed
a sheet of water
torn to mist

speed-rush
a beach waterfall dives
into the sea

mill race
spring sunshine
pushing the wheel

waterfall
at the top of the hill
buddha

stone lantern
a trickle of light
in the waterfall

water falling
the crystal parts
of a rock fall

speckled rock
drops from a waterfall
blur

concave rock
the convex bulge
of the waterfall

a popped balloon
breath
a breeze again

washing the newborn
ties with rainwater
cloud to earth

newborn
wet with the water
unrained

april winds
a birth announcement
in the wrong mail box

flood waters crest
someone by the river puts water
in a coffee pot

breakfast coffee
the excitement of an ocean
in my cup

threads of smoke
breakfast fires of neighbors
tied together

pale spring sunshine
spread over breakfast toast
quince jelly

beating egg yolks
two yellow butterflies
twist in the fog

early morning rain
the dry sound inside the cabin
of oatmeal cooking

for sale signs
yet nobody can own
the river

a bit of sky
pushed aside
the new house

walls
of knotty pine
raindrops

sound of rain
as a dry roof
arches

arches
splashing rain
on a tin roof

raindrops
flattening the roof
till it shines

running away
from four corners of the roof
patter of rain

mashed thumb
out of it flies
a purple oath

return of the cold
flesh by her thumbnail
splits and bleeds

across the canyon
the neighbor hammers
on an echo

sky blue
the faded quilt warm
in the rain

cloudy day
the pattern in the native rug
looks like rain

spring sunshine
warming the wool
of winter socks

used clothes
childhood and peanut butter
buying a dress

sun and skin
turning cart wheels
a young girl

sliver of moon
a peeled willow wand
in a boy's hand

flickering shadows
the way children imitate
ballet dancers on tv

rain on the roof
reading in the novel
of hurrying feet

balance act
with a gust of wind
a crash of bowls

tai chi on the beach
one gull watches
with outstretched wing

surf sand
sinking in
human feet

fasting
the sunrise brings
nothing to eat

the macho man
all of his children
just like him

on the pier
the old farmer tells us
how to fish

as the tide ebbs
fishermen appear
on the sand

ocean fog
fishing boats
in the sky

evening
the river full of fish
fishermen

dusk lake
sinking into darkness
fishermen's voices

gone fishing
the fly-specked sign hangs
from one corner

foreign
the fishing boat pushed aside
our familiar kelp

the blue boat
a hole in the sea
filled with fish

sunday morning
a fishing breeze tugs
at his tie

fishing
green spots in the river
catch the light

river edged
by the squeak of boots
fishermen

surf fishing
when they saw our catch
beer appeared

tied to the pier
the fishy smells
of empty boats

fishing
in the clear pool
a reflected branch

thoughts
dangling in the river
a fishing line

in the fisherman's pail
his gourmet names
for small fry

the childless woman
fishes with her man
bracelets of salt

river fog
untying the boat
from a long pier

tarnished
the silver knife turns red
against fish skin

cleaning her nails
my husband's lover
sells fish

morning light
catches fishing boats
far out at sea

scattered
from lighthouse to lighthouse
glow of fisherfolk

sunset
dark on the sea
fisher boats

low-tide rocks
coast dwellers going home
with a few groceries

fishermen
the one with a pole
watches a gull

no guests
the fly swatter lies
on the sunday papers

picking up shells
ah! there's an old one
moon in a tide pool

hermit crabs click together
after my morning hum
applause

looking for shells
above the dark sand
the sun rose

a box of sea shells
finding your letters
of long ago

a smooth stone
covered with barnacles
points homeward

low tide weather
salt-stained trouser legs
sandy pockets of air

on the beach
a broken sea shell thought
the forgotten dentist visit

kite string
a child's name spoken
in a high wind

a kite
raising from sea mists
rainbow colors

watercolor class
the painted blue sky
becomes a kite

beach
the hermit's kite
soaring gulls

flying a kite
gulls above the beach stare
at the old couple

a downed kite
the child whispers
sh it's sleeping

wind dies
as the string goes limp
wake up kite!

driftwood lair
lovers hidden from view
discovered by the wind

beach nap
plugged into the power
of incoming waves

her swollen belly
giving a shape
to baby clothes

her waist
long gone encircling
a child

flood swollen stream
the pregnant woman waits
at home

young mother
with a squeaky toy
explains the birthmark

doctor's office
the new mother sings
off key

stars come out
counting baby toes
one by one

a womb
home to a womb
daughter

mountain climbing
pausing in the level place
to dance

wind soughs
in harp strings
chords

melody
from the ocean's surface
a ripple of harp

another song
the drone of a dulcimer
rain on a cedar roof

old melody
picked out of the air
one note at a time

a minuet
and you
sharpening pencils

singing
gentle sounds of rain
silence a voice

water flowing
around the round notes
organ music

out of a dark cloud
the piano solo
arpeggio of rain

cat's cradle
all of the strings
of a clarinet

gentle breathing
before the performance
rhythms of rain

water colors
the flute concert
steals gray

flute concert
taming the wind storm
with a symphony

hailstorm
the bride's first pea soup
uneaten

rain drops
a blanket of gray silk
on the bed

the beach
into watercolors
blowing sand

bright colors
of her photograph
when he lived

early spring
only the hoe handle
is warm to touch

the rock
carried yesterday pulls on
tonight's shoulder

such a spring day
dad spades his garden
wherever he is

dark moon
something moves deep with
a carrot seed

strawberries planted
the blister on her palm
glows bright red

april snow
black plowed earth
turned to white

raindancer
from his face drops
beads of sweat

with water
begging the soil soon
for lettuce

nail in a fence post
warming in the sun
for the first time

foggy yacht harbor
boats and sailors
still asleep

rocking gently
late in the morning boats
still asleep

snowman
bowing down
to spring

as the snowman shrinks
the day is lengthened
by the march wind

spring sunshine
the snowman too
loses his head

stove black
simple life spring
house cleaning

cabin bed
a blanket of mold
greening spring

a spring storm
the bath brush bristles
bent to one side

freshly washed jeans
haiku in the pocket
are also clean

laundry hung out
the old cat and i
sit together

a day of sunshine
caught on a clothes line
covers the bed

spring cleaning
the last of the lint
in my navel

rotting april snow
the refrigerator defrosts
automatically

fog rolls in
bare windows curtained
with sea green silk

seaside house
in a sunny corner
waves of warmth

incoming tide
moving the chairs
to the porch

scene from the steeple
a field of umbrellas
has come to market

breath taking
liquid air swirled rainbows
in soap bubbles

faint shadows
on the earth at eclipse
soap bubbles

grandmother's shawl
wrapping it about her shoulders
she decides to marry

torn silk
blown into a mist
bridal veil falls

buying a moonstone
with a bogus check
the wedding gift

wedding ceremony
shaping his hand
into a club

liver of lamb
tomorrow will weed
hills of potatoes

earth cools the wood
of a smooth handled hoe
even song

wild grasses
unable to escape
the chopping hoe

dawn
wind chimes melody
by a light breeze

shades of art deco
lying on the beach
abalone shells

mouths
dissolving rock faces
abalone

colors of seafoam
in the abalone
a cup of fog

tides turning
anemone
open

designing barnacles
foam on the shore
of shells

still stinging
yesterday's bee
dead

bees at the oasis
bringing desert sun
in to drink

bee lines
exciting the air
between flowers

a bulldozer
the small black bug
backs up

breakfast
fat lips of baby birds
open the day

picnic in the woods
papa brings a prize bug
to baby birds

morning magic show
now you see the baby rabbits
now you don't

the ears of a rabbit
aglow in the morning sun
and down a hole

sunrise
on the ridge a white ring
around a bird's eye

birds
filled with air
fly into it

the tempest returns
to a rain puddle
a bathing bird

bird feathers
in the night sound
spring rain

fading the colors
of a peacock feather
an iris blooms

joined by listening
the breath of disciples
in baby birds

above the snow
at the level of bird song
spring begins

from afar
a bird's beak opening
the gentle air

adding scrollwork
to a summer morning
bird song

white sparks
from a bird's beak
the first notes

air of rain
filled with drops
of bird song

bird call
two notes
of my pulse

between rocks
at low tide
bird song

first light
in dawn's forest
a bird peeps

geometry of birds
in the clearing a triangle
of call to call

the guru speaks
the microphone picks up
bird song

bird song
nights
where you touch me

bird song
the wordless poems
of early morning

sunset
the last light
bird song

thunder smashing
bird song against the earth
petals on the ground

twilight
the calls of birds
growing dark

blackbirds
tying cattails
to the sky

not yet spring
a blackbird leaves a branch
shivering

dawn song
the sky lightened
by bluebirds

raindrops
the pitter-patter
of blue jays

bordering
the wooded path
blue jay cries

my eye
the spot on the larva's back
where wings emerge

dry scraping
cat paws on a wooden floor
early morning rain

my chair
too small for the cat
by a tail and a leg

two feet plus two feet
the cat jumps down
to the chair's four feet

all the edges
of a yellow cat
all cat

free to a good home
turns out to be
full of kittens

in the dark
the young cat
full of kittens

a yellow cat
stalking the coward
in the mirror

pacemaker
old puss purrs
on his chest

toothbrushes
the swish of cat claw
in attack

listening to mozart
with her tail over her nose
the cat's ears flatten

the kittenless cat
her uneasiness at dusk
petted by grandma

a radiance
clinging to the ends
of cat hair

black and jagged
in the yellow cat's mouth
a mewing bird

curled up asleep
the cat after eating
a snake

paint brushes
lilac the cat drinks
rose water

the cat
wants in and out
april snow

moving tall grass
on a wind-rippled hill
cat fur

bird song
eaten by the silence
of a cat

the guru speaks
a cat climbs a ladder
to sit on the roof

open window
the cat stares into space
as the guru speaks

the guru murmurs
two cats fight
over a dead bird

violin concert
the cat scratches her tummy
and walks out

beethoven's fifth
the cat gives birth
to another kitten

looking the same
the now-tuned harp
well-fed cat

paw print
catching the morning sun
in wet sand

a sitting cat
her one eye reading
my book

white whiskers
a spray of milk
on a pink tongue

a cat dreaming
her striped tail switches
into a snake

the old cat
too sick
to cover it up

a sliver moon
sinking into delirium
the sick cat

among the stars
unseen planets
the cat dies

up and down
on wooden stairs
cats in love

howling desert winds
in salt cedar trees
mating cats

howling tomcats
two old guys discussing
impotence

bulging
within an egg the chick's
blind eye

sprinkles
between raindrops
chickadees

a black rock
the sea wave explodes
a crown of cormorants

leaving cows
on a sea cliff meadow
a tiny man

sea cliff meadows
heavy fog lifting
two  no ten cows

crab balls
on the menu  no wonder
they walk funny

raising his foot
a crane scatters stars
sunk in the pond

knowing of cuckoos
i refuse to send to her
a mother's day card

tense neck muscles
watching the eagle
in morning's swift flight

within this egg
festival of the seventh day
a heart beats

morning
wearing the gentle colors
of baby deer

thunderstorm
covered with a caul
the fawn is born

after a thunderstorm
drops slide down her flanks
the fawn is born

lightning
fireflies peek at themselves
in a puddle

a waning moon
scales of a ling cod
fly from a knife

carp banners
in the slipstream
of spring

young

in the tiniest
fish scales

chirping here and there
finches draw magic diagrams
in the spring air

overflowing
one frog

a sound in the frog's mouth
home again

billowing
frog voices in spring air
damask curtains

scattered clouds
shaped by frogs
croaking

neither night nor day
frogs and bats

abandoned theater
the moon spotlights
a frog-prince

in the shallows
a child learns to swim
by frog eyes

frogs
sitting in the river
all of us

creaking voice
frog joints as stiff as mine
rainy days

pond ripples
heartbeat of a frozen frog
warms again

a new puddle
frogs joining
old star light

frog silence
pond shadow
in my ear

monks chanting
only at first are they
still temple frogs

frogs
naming the first stars
aloud

quiet waters
frogs all listening
to my shower

leaping into the river
the frog watches me
still as a rock

floating the moon
the silver tide of grunion
ride on the beach

soaring above cliffs
freshly painted

from dark rock crevices

having for breakfast
someone else

and hermit crab

that flutters

waiting for the wave

with kittens

newborn in the wide meadow
stand touching

squeezing out
a newborn lamb

parting fog
on wind barren meadows
birth of a lamb

rivers to the sea
bending with the songs
of meadow larks

shell-veined
breast of a lark swelling

soaring
the bird out flies
its name

bubbles
larva in pond scum
fly away

on the beach only limpets
feel at home

whispering welcome
to our winter-weary selves
returning geese

goats to be milked
lower under heavy skies
bucket cloudy white

minnows
rippling river sand
two-year old toes

spring
minnows patterned
by fallen leaves

out in the river
a minnow

on my pillow
moth wing dust

in a mouse nest
one pink nose
on a cat

spring floods
tiny fishes swimming by
a bird's nest

nest
filled with spring time
eggs

forming eggs
the roundness of a breast
in a nest

around a bird
the nest

lady carpenter
by her house the bluebird
builds her nest

within a shell
eggs laid warm
in a hollow nest

shadows hatched
nightingales
in morning light

oyster barbecue
a mother of six watches
the pile of shells

moving into the sun
the pony takes with him
some mountain shadow

feeding her ponies
all of her stories
the precious hours

running over the pasture
lift the pony's tail

free puppies' eyes
in dirty store windows
filmy blue

ebb tide
a young puppy searching
for place to pee

blushing a bit
the rising spring sun
on the robin's breast

at the bird feeder
robins fighting
over wives

she doesn't notice
a child with the doll carriage
the mother robin

a robin sings
as if it was he
who planted the garden

a rooster crows
by just that much
the day is longer

tiny salamander
a look as long and ancient
as your mating

silence
from a sea shell
a heart's mirror

a whorled shell
pale ear pressed in sand
surf sounds

in one sky
x-ray photos of sea shells
wet wisps of fog

sea lions bark
and then turn back
the sea is pink

sea lions bark
their breath comes ashore
as mist

into the sunny meadow
shorn sheep covered
with night cold

after the storm
small waves on sea meadows
meek sheep

days of the week
sheep enter the fold
of night

white waves splash
on the hillside
scattered sheep

sleeping late
on the doorstep
two slugs

waiting for rain
the slow way slugs
make love

a phi-based spiral
unwinds a snail's
slippery path

periwinkles
signing secret names
in wet sand

following a snake
the river wiggles
down canyon

squatters rights
debated by the snake
in the lettuce

nervous
the thin weed touched
by a snake

winding the road
a snake
into a flat tire

a twitter

a passing shower

door chimes
the spring spider moves
eight legs

rainbows
sunlight segmented
by a spring spider

to dream the dreams
of starfish

fitting into the dome of sky
starfish

starfish
seeing blue sky
for the first time

storks have returned
suddenly this old barn roof
brooding

home again
fluttering in the eaves
barn swallows

spotlessly clean
the swallow's nest
made of mud

from the broken bell
the chatter of swallows
nest building

dark barrel
sun in the tadpole's mouth
metamorphosing

on the same day
tadpoles get their hind legs
bulging eyes

clouds on the pond
popped by kisses of tadpoles
coming up for air

strange faces
in wind-curved cypress
termites

fresh picked
a bouquet of flowers alive
with ticks

pouring drops
from pitcher to inkstone
a thrush sings

rain falling
the thrush pulls up a worm
inch by inch

light carried in my arms
apple blossoms from a neighbor
on my doorstep

clusters talking
together in admiration
apple blossoms

sun transformed
into apple blossoms
the ground is level

the dam is broken
spring cascades into valleys
as apple blossoms

apple trees
dead white before flowering
fuzzy buds

spring sunshine
too-early guests wait
under budding trees

abandoned orchard
desert apple trees bloom
pioneer spirits

pea soup lunch
out in garden rows
planting beans

without rain
beech leaves unfolding
slick and shiny

knotted fragrance
on spring bare branches
blossoms

cloud blossoms
brush strokes between clusters
story-telling branch

silence
in the blind wind's dance
blossoms

moonlight
among blossoming trees
a white parasol

silence
the blossoms
dance

a cascade
bracken sprouts unroll
spring

snowy mountains
green shadows of budding
birches

mountain curves
unfolding in new green
birches

white and thin
the light of spring
where buds dare

budding limbs
clouds raked
into new trees

without a word
each man goes outdoors
talks to the bushes

late spring
lawn dwarfs disappearing
into a leafy bush

shapes of space
a flower folded
in a bud

expanding the warmth
the first poppies
in spring sunshine

dizzy
at the end of its spiral
calla lily whiteness

late spring
a dried-up streambed
full of lilies

on all four sides
of the long-gone shack
calla lilies

mountain hollow
in the radiance of fog
cherry blossoms

hearing bells
cherry blossoms shaken
by a breeze

cherry blossoms
firelight comes down
to bare earth

fragrant
the sound of cherry blossoms
rattled by wind

lace
on her sunday dress
cherry blossoms

cherry trees
in full bloom he photographs
his fat wife

amidst the cherries
he photographs his wife
the pimple on her nose

cherry blossoms
their only warmth
cool in moonlight

still beautiful
the barren woman admires
flowering cherry

a young beauty
cherry trees bloom
after transplanting

putting smiles
on cherry blossoms
photographers

balloon man
cherry blooms float
on tree-trunk strings

spring sunshine
floating among cherry trees
gay balloons

ah
the exhaled breath of tourists
cherry flowers

shaming the ladies
in bright colored clothes
cherry blossoms

cherry blossoms
a truck goes by advertising
wonder bread

cherry blossoms
permitting picnickers
a fragrant lunch

a child
offers the cherry flowers
a bite

after viewing cherries
he blows up a paper sack
and pops it

a bee alights
on a page of poems
cherry blossoms

across the border
soldiers and a cherry tree
relatives of mine

a spring nap
downstream cherry trees
in bud

a long journey
some cherry petals
begin to fall

garden waterfall
cherry petals float to earth
in the sound

beacon for bees
a pink and white fan
of cherry petals

the fragrance
filling empty lunch boxes
cherry petals

waterfalls
cherry petals
also

clogging the stream
the scent of cherry petals
in the air

old couple sleeping
under trees twined together
cherry petals

turning to leave
cherry petals flutter around
departing guests

in the remote valley
spring arrives with hail
bruised petals

a fire
above sun warmed bricks
cherry petals

pencil poised
nothing on the paper
but cherry petals

evening clouds
tinted pink in clusters
of cherry petals

weeping willows
over the stream clogged
with petals

vacant skies
cherry trees bloom
all the white light

pale skies
cherry trees capture
all the white light

tree trunks
dark nails hold festival posters
cherry time

scarred trunks
of cherry trees
a bee walks on

cherry tree trunks
twisted tapers with white light
flower fire

yoshino cherry trees
nodding over a book
borrowed from the library

a cooling breeze
yoshino cherry trees
in santa rosa

lace on blue sky
wearing nothing under
cherry trees

old man napping
in spring sunshine at noon
daffodils nod too

mile markers
daffodils gone wild
on highway one

rejection slip
the daffodil remains
unmoved

rainy day
spilling out of a pitcher
daffodil sunshine

sea fog
the far meadow dusted
with daisies

spring warmth
dandelions bloom
more suns

in the shade
a spot of sun
a stray dandelion

under ferns
the roar of the creek
seeping in

bowing on short stems
flowers first day of spring
in the wind

rain colored
by the light falling
into a flower

bedtime
sea winds laid in
closed flowers

footprints
in cracks of granite rocks
flowers

blushed with pollen
her nose in a flower
wet on purpose

tiny blue stones
paving the path to you
forget me nots

morning sun
finding the fuchsia
already pink

garden dreaming
the many shapes and colors
with fragrance

march snow
footprints turning back
into grass

new grass
echoing from yard to yard
lawn mowers

green
the knowing name
of glen spirits

redwood
when one is cut
green sprouts

spirit dwelling
holes in rocks
sprouting green

hawthorn hedgerow
on new-ploughed earth
scattered petals

a roundness
pushing outward
the iris opens

this iris opens
the furled flag
of other worlds

blooming withering
on one straight stalk
iris

a ballerina
unfolding the iris
other music

never known to bees
the iris withers in rooms
of a maiden aunt

on a stalk
the butterfly wings
an iris

waiting with it
one iris withers
evening

opening
the iris
the poem

iris blooming
the seventh one opens
differently

sky
entering the iris
as it opens

eyes
enter the iris
open wide

a breeze
bumping blossoms
bees

folding paper
the faded iris
withers

shape-changing
in the witch's eye
an iris opens

arching
the iris opens
a rainbow

spreading sepals
one more poem
opens the iris

windfall
the broken iris blooms
high in a vase

iris blooms
leaving the clear calyx
its purple touch

messages moving
without muscles
iris fragrance

a blue cup
on the table an iris
half open

fading the colors
of a peacock feather
an iris blooms

applause
sepals of the iris
unclapping

eyes in secret places
deep in the purple middle
of an iris

eyes
on the purple petals
of iris

eyes
entering the iris
half-closed

trinity in
blue gold and purple
iris

listening for purple
the iris opens
with a pop

a shared shape
iris leaves
swollen with buds

purple blue
without moving a muscle
the iris opens

all male
even when in bloom
bearded iris

blue iris
pool rippled water
in the leaves

her anger
painting the iris black
the child in her

sea side meadows
ocean's lupine
a deeper purple

last light
the brightness of lupine
growing low

home-grown lettuce
the taste of well water
green

a hill
under a cloud
of lilac

between the fields
a break in the evening mist
three lilac bushes

light
buried in a bulb
lilies

snow melting
magnolia buds
higher

sunlight
taking just one spray
of mimosa

two sides of a pond
here miner's lettuce
there a skim of ice

sea cliff meadows
the bull sneezes
narcissus

silence
columns of earth sprouting
new leaves

spring
morning finds a new sign
on every leaf

leafing trees
in evening's purple glow
no longer bare

filling
a spring-flooded river
new green leaves

edges of oak
extended by new leaves
bright as blossoms

sea wind
pushing up the mountain
new green leaves

pale light
cool in the dim forest
new leaves

planting onion sets
the roar of surf
that much louder

onions planted
pushed into soft earth
bombs in libya

pansies
in a canning jar
baby photos

peeping through snow
the folded up faces
of pansies

winter ends
a row of peas covered
with earth

plum blossoms
the smell of white sheets
with white

plum blossoms
a fragrance in the air
star-shaped

plum tree
remembering us
that time

plum tree
throwing off its bareness
pure white perfume

where sleep the birds
with dry feathers
a white-plum night

primrosed
the spring sun
among green leaves

days measured
by wild primrose clocks
crocus calendars

in the mailbox
a bunch of radishes
from a neighbor

roots of radishes
sand caught in tiny hairs
her laughing lips

gone fishing
the only takers
pussy willows

bed springs creak
by snow-melt freshets
a redbud branch

far from malls
city women in the woods
pick rhododendron

it's may
the somber pine forest
pink with rhodies

mountain bouquet
the whole forest full
of rhodies

raindrops
opening rhododendrons
at dusk

outdoor shower
rhododendrons stare
at my nipples

leave the laundry
rhododendrons can be
our bright colors

chattering visitors
finally silent before
the rhododendron

fog
the first rhodie
fades

after blooming
the rhododendron bushes
sink back into the woods

root circle
a pool of water
growing in a tree

dark soil
pushed from a seed
a blind root

spring rain
a dance with tiny steps
of tree roots growing

white rose petals
transparent in the night sky
a not-round moon

fragrance
tied in a knot
rosebuds

curling
painted roses
where the roof leaks

a field of safflower
there at the top of the hill
leaning on the sky

dead cypress
in its wind-shadow
saplings

transplanted
saplings from the far ridge
all these thoughts

between rain
showers the slanted rays
of the scotch bloom

escaping spring
tangled in sea weed
a sharp smell

blue sky held by
still wet laver leaves
held by a rock

under the earth
newly planted seeds
part of the moonrise

seedling
larger by a drop of water
caught on its leaf

an arched back
the seedling bursts
into the light

shepherd's purse
growing as high
as my hip pocket

bending low
a heart leans to the soil
picking strawberries

early morning
vine tendrils curl and hold
the day still

river veins
and tree root muscles
green leaf skin

trees held together
upright white pillars
of light

silence in wood
between the growing
rings

everything green
yet some trees naked
with moss

cold light of day
it makes the trees stop
night whispers

whirlpools
from earth to sky
tree sap

deep in the woods
the may month trillium
deep in a dream

tulip fields
the elegance of folk
wearing wooden shoes

standing before
a wide field of flowers
one tulip

bright by the candle
the tulips also
are burning

picking wild flowers
the early spring sun
in my hand

wild flowers
abandoned by the road
a strange car

sea fragrance
rising from the cliff
breath of wild flowers

desert
wild flower colors
all rock

a meadow
made by a violin
wild flower notes

puffs of smoke
logging trucks' exhaust
among wild lilac

hillsides
clouds in the bushes
of wild lilac

lost on the mountain
the smell of wild lilac
sickening sweet

sunshine
caught by wild mustard
passed to the gorse

ancestors
the wild plum
blooms again

time
unmeasured by willows
swaying

water-dowsing
the willows tremble
in spring floods

slanted sunshine
the river breaks and dapples
beneath the willows

spring rains
the willow strings
raindrops

long hard rain
hanging in the willows
tender new leaves

spring
high in the willows
flood waters

wind murmuring
as it spreads pollen
the arched willow

nude beach
the first ones out
pussy willows

spring bare sun
by winter's high waters
willows laid low

water witching
willow wands
bend the river

willow shadows
the length of a nap
on the river bank

contrails
pussy willows fluff
in spring skies

moraine crevasses
a line of willows
winding the creek

river willow
heavy drops on
glistening wands

willow branches
holding together
raindrops

april storms
green willow wands
sweeping snow

spring rain
young leaves the fragrance
of moistened soil

wind perfumed
from a woman's shoulder
desert night

leaving the beach
only she has sand
on her back

sand
where lovers laid
a shallow depression

summer sun
drops of sweat mingle
with sperm

eyelids closed
the naked sleepers
curled into fish

lying naked
open to summer stars
this old couple

the whole bed
yet he lays his head
in my hand

sea fog
hiding morning-mussed hair
places you've kissed

sweeping the floor
sunrise on papers
left by lovers

he's angry again
alone on the porch
with a red star

hot air
his arguments
on my face

crumpled silence
after the argument
moth wings

our angry silence
old faithful geyser
blows off steam

this heat
the harp too
out of tune

the neighbor lady
scolding her child
is also god

picking up sleep
where you left it at dawn
afternoon nap

sun from the east
ocean waves from the west
our entertainment

dancing on the beach
i jab a stick into the sky
to break up the blue

white dance
in the beach walk skirt
folds of moonlight

i come to you clothed
only in the dampness of fog
and our dancing

hard glances
the sun on the sea
a virile man

she
showing him a sea cave
and more

almond nails
pressed into brown skin
a faint perfume

moon lights
houses of hermit crabs
my damp blanket

star paths
the tender roots
of passion

voices
bridging the stream
stepping stones

your voice
tying me to the desert
toast pops up

airport phone call
the heart leaves
without luggage

flying
the mountains bend down
to our meeting

koi dart and hide
from the net dipped
coming of autumn

departing summer
and when it's gone
the river's low

one leaf floats
in the sand castle's moat
end of summer

circus acrobats
come to the end of summer
leaping and falling

asleep in a boat
to dream the dreams
of water lilies

desert nights
the clarity of dreams
warm and real

dream dancer
sleeping without a pillow
on scarred boards

remembering a dream
and then the circus
was over

eyes closed
knowing by heart
the rest

days so complete
words become the calls of birds
the high tide wind

only borrowed
this summer day
this beach

wet silk
cupping her breast
night river

outdoor shower
bathed in sun colors
of hot water

slipping into the pool
naked divides the night
sun-warmed waters

gentle nights
of desert wind
a woman's breast

touching myself
your name
on my lips

placing the flute
against her lips something
slips into place

british pub
an unfaithful man blows
suds from his beer

getting into bed
the stranger
even browner

eating melon
bites given on the point
of his knife

the blood circle
mother and daughter wading
in the surf

i'm not old
all night my eyes have held
the ancient stars

with the ocean's roar
i climb the hills home
not alone

sweeping bare floors
the summer empty cabin
very full

glowing
a flag unfurls
native happiness

long summer day
how many animals
i've been

on a bright sunny day
comes your smiling face
light added to light

just two stars
yet our eyes are closed
in ecstasy

high cliff
the heart beats the blue sky
like a flaying stick

kissing
together in a glass
our toothbrushes

desert kisses
hotter
than ever before

morning stars fade
waking a small bird
our lips

summer night
empty mountain road filled
with our laughter

laughter added to the heat
my lover's farts can't kill
mosquitoes

angel wings
propelled through the air
by laughter

tongue
tasting
pink

shapes
pure light the face
of a loved one

blue spots
tattooed with love
from his teeth

lovers
pulse of fire gods
in bubbling waters

lovers
cradled in caves
lovers

hot tongues
the little language
of lovers

lovers
the lamplighted lane
a way away

nights
the grove of little trees
swollen with lovers

moon white water
lovers in the secret cove
saturday night

just as tangled
paths in the berry patch
lovers

lovers
heat of a summer night
fill the moon

making love
the unevenness of boards
on the porch

skin
touching
whispers

a butterfly
from your finger
light touches

following wet tracks
into the secret garden
he enters

hovering hums
mosquitoes watch us
making love

packing
between unworn shirts
sea sounds

moments of forever
beach day chitin
fossil in lava

gazing into fires
seals in my mind
wind-water pictures

red marks
from your white teeth
mosquito bites

curving sandstone cliffs
the yellow school bus
where time stands still

memories
over a river of sunlight
a time bridge

the narrow bed
we breath each other
all afternoon

on bare arms
the noon-day sun melted
hot metal sweet

before the summer storm
rises the close smell
of two skins

after paying
the whore seems to be
someone's sister

applause
scenery painted
by a one-armed boy

company's coming
over-friendly flies
buzzing at the door

prostitute
now a freeway rest area
her mother's home

finally it's friday
the passion flower blooms
wrinkling the bedspread

crawling on the bed
tendrils of passion flowers
thick on the porch

shadows of leaves
cover the open holes
her flute forgotten

the sun and hunger
watches without winding
on a summer day

tourist fear
the ocean will ruin
land's end clothes

clasped hands
holding the nervousness in
his thumbs

in rain in sun
how do you run from your hours
window box zinnia?

shelling peas
the pregnant woman asks
is forty old?

silence
in a knot hole
stares

traveling through
basho in your town
you in mine

beach party
losing in the sand
her many years

a world closed
the roar of surf
plugs my ears

quiet evening
all the wind
back in the flute

on vacation
the summer sun
far out to sea

summer stars
finding all the familiar things
edged with morning

campfire embers
all the demons nearly gone
in the morning sun

distance softens
and rounds the hills
our relationship

his penis in her
lightning strikes
very close

a gentle rain
in me
your poems

curve of a wave
holding perfect
a summer day

satisfaction
the cooling breeze
between lovers

my head
resting on the pillow
of your voice

we share these hours
gifts with many small parts
complete together

beaches where no one goes
their share of sand
gentle waves

tiny cabin
distant shelter of woods
and sky within me

caught between rocks
seaweed in the rising tide
seems to wave to me

smooth sand
following waves
back to the sea

summer weary
the sky leans down an arch
of cypress

asleep
holding your breath
in my hand

beach-blown
my sea-foam body
awaits your hand

hot night
legs spread wide
where sleep should be

neon lights blink
glances pass underneath
dark lashes

hung over the bed
the unpainted painting
mosquito netting

swirling dust
excitement flickers
within the tent

circus
red flags flutter
hearts

acrobats
unfolding the circus tent
first

outdoor circus
in the center ring
a butterfly

juggling sunshine
on clapping hands
little red hearts

outdoor circus
sun on the brightest costumes
fading

family circus
acrobats lifted high
on joined hands

champion
on the flying trapeze
a butterfly

hearts flying
on the high trapeze
a blond young man

trapeze artists
catching the sun
each other

mountain village
in the one-ring circus
a balance act

juggler
the children's eyes
in his hands

juggling illusions
the circus man
with many balls

circus bleachers
old enemies crowd
close together

circus
backstage the heat
everyone squirms

tinsel flash
under shiny sweat
goose bumps

magic act
wondering where the scarf went
when the wind blew

high wire act
on the ground children dance
arms outstretched

intermission
all the real clowns stand up
and smile

between acts
the quiet music
of bowing trees

clown act
without a tent
the wind as wild

part of the joke
clapping for stagehands
who fix the pole

empty morning light
the trampled grass circle
of the circus tent

dog days
a bitch in heat
laceless shoes

a field of stars
square and curved
the american flag

sea winds
cutting into a blue sky
a square of flag

independence day
all the fireworks
in your eyes

sparklers
in the night sky
stars

sun burnt
and from fireworks
star crazy

patriots
etched in their eyes
sparklers

sea shells
and sky rockets
beach holiday

another wave
the last sparkler
a bent wire

independence day
the empty flagpole
poking stars

independence day
the lower road bridge
collapses

two crows
and a sea gull having someone
else's picnic

independence day
the county courthouse
blown sky-high

independence day
the parade majorette
with the shorter skirt

holiday
a marshmallow wind
on browning bodies

5th of july
the portable ice chest
drying inside out

a single mom
the paper days until
school is out

summer breeze
the shouts out of school
children again

summer skies
the clearness of children's voices
out of school

school picnic
someone very young teaches him
to boogie

school picnic
the ticket seller raises her fingers
as she adds

midsummer's eve
lately bracken fern
invisible

midsummer
day and night balanced
no wind

a broken shoe string
summer begins
barefoot

holes in the hammock
thoughts run through
my mind unfiltered

black pine
against the never dark sky
midsummer's eve

midsummer's eve
her brief white gown
shortens the night

tanabata
and beside me tonight
an empty pillow

seaside vacation
unwinding the kite string
unwinding

in desert sand
cinder temples seem to be
from china

grand canyon
tourists sucked out of california
by a big hole

grand canyon
deeper with each camera click
the tourists smile

in the roar
of yosemite falls photos
kids scared smiles

under cathedral spires
two ancient sequoias
and a trash bin

quacking ducks
on my favorite beach
tourists coming

clouds come and go
just as quickly on the beach
tourists

lake tahoe
tired eyes stare down
at a tiny rivulet

desert poverty
even dirt has been left
in the casino

bare tops
death valley tourists
on a hot day

tourists
overlooking badwater
each with a coke

tourists in italy
pan's pipes and the crucifix
in one museum

out-of-season tourists
at san juan capistrano
hummingbirds

scenic spots
full of a century
of tourists' eyes

mountain gorge
before the great view falling
asleep

snobbish hotel
the rusty old cars
of employees

around the pool
their nipples exposed
men

mountain river
shriveled to harmlessness
summer tourists

surf sounds
then my motel neighbor
turns off the shower

lying on the bed
layered with other lives
motel night

motel morning
the strange bird's song
in another migration

vacation
finally relaxing
fog dissolves

vacation ends
one last splash of a wave
i am gone too

drowsy colored
the summer afternoon
weighs nothing

desert air
invisible smoke of sagebrush
clear

softness
desert air flows
through giant rocks

coming to sea cliffs
the off shore breeze raises
a flower fragrance

beach tent billows
in the summer blue
white clouds

desert sounds
out of the sun's way
clouds moving

morning downpour
raised to new heights
afternoon clouds

dancing lights
clouds sprinkle the sun
across water

clouds
colored by open wall
a driftwood lair

curving with the land
a rainbow of clouds
moves out to sea

ocean clouds
here and there
a sailor's wish

sea clouds
film long exposed to
a white water river

shell-shaped
the highest peaks
swirl clouds

majestic peaks
making majestic clouds
we shield our eyes

clouds
canyon walls
of yosemite

thunder
rolling up the mountain
great white clouds

after the rain
breathing deeply
white valley clouds

western peaks
the last clouds
set afire

between boards
shadows on a sunny porch
a slender coolness

light
rippling the lake
with coolness

the august moon
rises with the coolness
of a thunderstorm

daylight
in paths of falling stars
flights of birds

alone
climbing the afternoon peaks
the day moon

sparkling
on bright water
unseen day stars

first light
pouring into lava mountains
cloud red

dawn
with the light
winds

morning sun
the twinkle of stars
still in the dew

sudden downpour
now we outdoor folks
own a waterbed

drought white
a withered tree hangs
over the bath tub

unearthly
silence of a drought year
drying

constipation
from dry desert winds
only farts

rustling on the roof
leaves of a drought year
in the rain gutter

behind me
fog closes in
the golden gate

ocean fog
hangs in the pine trees
a white hammock

sunrise finds
fog in the valleys
fingers in sand

fog
the sun and i shout
the morning

evening fog
a door slams
softly

crackle of paper
an afternoon of shopping
the heat

hot night
sleep too
has melted

vibrating crystals
the heat
moving mountains

heat waves
bringing to the desert
an ocean view

heat wave
the nautilus shell
unwinds

a high wave
bumping the horizon
curled by blue

evening
drawing a line of pink
mountains

on the horizon
waves by the buoy
bump the sky

incoming tide
covers sun blackened rocks
with a hot day

sun in a towel
drying a wet body
the hot day

summer light
spun into a handmade rug
lambs wool

gazing at sunset
the dark road home
filled with light

last light
rising out of the cliff
seven gulls

today's light
goes into the sea
an open window

power lines
lacing the sky
with electricity

out of darkness
that covers stars
lightning

forked lightning
the river begins
in the sky

car lights curve
nights along the coast
flashes of lightning

in a streak
lightning across the floor
a scorpion

long day
waiting for the cove
to fill with water

longer day
the sun lingers
in the warmth

moonlight
unfolded from clean sheets
covers the bed

moonlight
a child's high voice
above the darkness

pink and blue
birth of ocean-sky
morning

nearly awake
sea-gathered morning
on sleeping faces

morning light
things of the day
taking shape

morning light
the open eyes
of basket shadows

springing up
into colorful cliffs
morning sun

morning winds
eases the slender moon
from the ridge

noon clouds
on lava mountains
burned shapes

noon clouds
a dark spirit shape
on lava buttes

noon sun
straight down
the steep cliff

noon
turning low hills
into clouds

noon-day sun
rolling the fog out to sea
the round ball

as night
the bump and thump
of ocean waves

night lights
in the secret cove
moonlit sea foam

nights
showing us inside
mountains

desert lake
night enters the blue
coolness

evening skies
in a high mountain lake
open to night

nights
a window
to another world

partly cloudy
packing the few things
to leave the ocean

summer rains
the umbrella also
wet waiting for you

vacation
the weather report
all wet

summer rains
drumming
your fingers in me

rain stops
we sleep
still dripping

whisper of rain
on a sunny day the surf
wets my feet

late summer rain
surprising
an open window

rain lets up
colors come to life
with a breath of wind

clouds
curved in sea foam
rainbows

waterfall
completing the rainbow
a woman's body

waterfall
coming apart
rainbows

rainbow hour
across the lake
mountains of sun

out of a wave
rainbows of high tide
arching wind

under rain clouds
the far valley full of light
at sunset

broken rain clouds
one sunset slips
into another

broken rain clouds
slanted sunset light
moving mountains

low clouds
skirting the mountain
a line of white

ragged rain clouds
blurring the sharpness
of lava peaks

sweeping the porch
bright prints of raindrops
followed by splashes

desert wash
variegated stones speckled
with raindrops

hot humid day
in a sudden breeze
raindrops of wind chimes

wind
in a dry riverbed
raindrops

towers of rising sun
spread over the dark lake
wispy clouds

short night
colors of a sighing
in the wind

painting skies
soft hills brush clouds
warm colors

evening colors
fire rock mountains
enter the sky

evening skies
the pink of hills rises
above them

evening blue
shadows from the hills
float to the sky

without stars
the sky eases pink
into the lake

drifting out to sea
sky colors warmed
in the hills

between the two elms
how that patch of blue changes
in the high wind

a south wind
the yellow cat lies down
under a chair

fire-white halo
at the moment of eclipse
i notice your face

solar dust
visible during eclipse
all over the room

dappled forest floor
the eclipsed sun
in a myriad of leaves

under trees
a thousand crescent suns
eclipsed by leaves

spindrift
falling into the sea
stars

between stars
harp chords stringing
unearthly lights

sleepless
another bright star descends
into sea mist

glass in granite
tide pools glitter
stars

all the stars
at my feet
the flashlight wavers

crossing darkness
of deep space
each star

flat sea night
faint wake of clear eyes
gazing star to star

venus and the moon
in conjunction with
my blankets and me

twinkling with laughter
stars
my old flashlight

low desert campfire
a shower of sparks
again stars

white water
the path to the valley
full of stars

a window opens
on the midnight sea
all the stars

a shower of stars
dampened by the roar
of a wave

a rim
of wild foaming surf
crab nebula

high winds
stars spinning by
in perfect circles

venus
watching you sleep
with me

into the sea
a shower of stars
dark edge of land

night sky
so filled with stars
gulls do sleep

open window
stars drift in
on sea mist

stars
in a basket broken
on white stones

my staring eyes
creating in the night sky
one star after another

stars
scratched in the night
light wheels

sunset
the show begins
with stars

velvet nights
the desert wind
warm with stars

a blaze
out of the big dipper
a shooting star

sharing the night
atop a remote mountain
the brightest star

extinguished
a candle leaves the night
filled with stars

summer night
every star
also hot

hot night
all the stars out
naked

counting stars
these two small eyes
close in sleep

night of stars
on her lips his
stars of night

twinkling stars
splashes of light
on dark wet oars

august night
the melon moon seeding
the stars

riddles
the stars
answer

woods so still
one can hear the stars
burning close

storm purple hills
grass green hills pinned
with a wet blue fence

summer moon
feeling our love
warm the night

summer moon
in our eyes
only each other

summer moon
listening to our words
hides in the pines

summer moon-viewing
kids squat in a circle
to knuckle-shoot marbles

meeting the moon
on ash meadows
summer hiker

melted a hole
the moon slipped in
a summer sky

summer moon
on the tails of fireflies
fire flies

summer moon
a jar of fireflies
by a sleeping child

hot weather
the inflated moon rises
in the heat

seaside sun
burnished by waves
salt air

hot tub
a blazing sun
enters the ocean

rolling east to west
the desert sun flattens
low hills

cooling shadows
the curve of rock
around the sun

desert sun
greeting the morning
in a hot tub

purple skies
melting into lava peaks
sun glow

without wind
desert sun slides into
the narrowest crack

dark brown
the desert sun tans
wooden buildings

golden granite
rolls to the horizon
a desert sun

desert sun
on leafless things
growing

cloudy sunrise
all the bird song colors
on rounded raindrops

a warm glow
over lava mountains
sunrise

morning rise
the desert sun comes
cooled

to return
to this place the sun
rises higher

waiting for sunset
the eastern hills redden
at our impatience

sunset
from below the canyon
night

sunset clouds
grand canyon
in the sky

sunsets
below the canyon rim
another world

sunset
snapping twigs
a campfire

warm cool
the mountain valley
sunset moonrise

blood-red skies
sweeping out to sea
sunset

sunset
lava mountain
fires again

incoming tide
to cover wet rocks
the glare of sunset

sunset
beyond land's end
fire into water

pacific rimmed
fire explodes into water
sunset sky

sunset
a hunter hawk drops
back into his shadow

setting sun
on riverside cabins
windows of water

back in their cars
sunset leaves
in the tourist's eyes

sunsets
into a valley
a column of light

sunset
a vacation ends
in the sea

red hot skies
coming home at sunset
fire gods

on the stairs
the sinking sun
climbs up again

sunset
a western range rises
as night sky

sunshine
a path through mountains
east to west

beach houses
blowing bright sunshine
between them

desert salt lake
preserving the last
sunlight

off and on
the message of sunlight
on a calm lake

sunlight
the yellow tablecloth
rumpled by our laughter

blown about
by magnetic storms
sun spots draw us

stuttering
rolls from hill to hill
thunder

yosemite falls
thunderheads gather
more at the top

electricity
into tree roots
thunder

heavy thunder
dropping down
of light rain

thunderstorm
yet on the far ridge sunset
perfect stillness

thunderstorm
in the stovepipe
soot falls

old film
on remote mountain tv
thunder and lightning

quiet now
everyone talking
about the thunderstorm

twilight
some of the light underwater
in a white stone

wind time
desert clouds blow
light into sunrise

desert wind
pale blue shadow
moving slightly

desert winds
blowing mountains
into the sun

summer winds
lined by the appetites
of spiders

rock formations
someone in the wind
with a fantasy

sunset winds
a screen door opens
and closes itself

red rock walls
the cool wind
as wide as holes

curved
blue side of the rock
of cool winds

warm wind
children's voices
melt in the night

a quiet bay
with seaweed and rocks
the sun at rest

a forest walk
ending at the beach
roots

morning beach
blue sand still quiet
in the tracks

cold wind
on the beach
foam fans

beach fire
flowing into waves
flames

rushing in rushing out
the wave's mini vacation
on the beach

darkening beach
the warmth of a person's eyes
for the sinking sun

scattered in sand
embers of a saltwood fire
face to face with stars

shell beach
wind blowing through
a train whistle

city folks
playing on the beach
board games

city voices
on the beach
the litter

sunny day
blown on the beach
clouds of sea foam

damp beach sand
where a naked witch squats
her heart

lonely beach walk
losing in the sand
car keys

tracking
the cliff-bound beach
noon clouds

beach fire
pale calla lilies
flame bright

again on the beach
drifting with dreams
she tracks sand

the beach
blowing sand
in water colors

a windless day
the beach colored
sea foam

pocket beach
after the climb back up
sand in mine

gravel beaches
the corners of the river
elbowing

summer fog
the beach wrapped up
in itself

wooden bridge
words found by a splinter
in bare feet

bridge timbers
a rumble in the creek
flowing under them

bridge song
vocal chords
of the river

meandering brook
my good intentions
melting away

canyon wash
clean
and dry

canyon
closing out
sea sounds

rain-torn
canyon walls
catch the sun

canyon walls
slip into the valley
river gravel

noon clouds
finding in the canyon
opals

wall by wall
the canyon releases blue rock
deep night sky

box canyon
in a dried up wash
ancient river rock

ancient river rock
running once again
down a muddy canyon

paint box canyon
the river a rainbow
of rocks

sloping into the sea
gull wings

sheer beauty
cliffs drop straight down
raising spirits

taking sunshine
into a secret cove
steepest cliffs

green growing
steeper than seacliff meadows
a lush smell

coast ranges
distance spills
into the sea

leaping up
a wave comes into
a secret cove

cupping the eye
the quiet cove
on a rocky coast

uhebehe crater
the inverted mountain
made of wind

crater rim
our kissing
with open mouths

taken by a creek
both feet exploring
wet

flapping in the wind
the whole town

a stretched horizon
of silence

well stocked

sand
curing the glare
high noon

creosote bushes bloom
sunset colors

scraped with yellow light
of sunset showers

of desert dunes

living in desert dunes
the ups and downs
of curved sand

dunes
mountain peaks
as hot and dry

retreating
from the eastern world
coastal dunes

in the warm places

on the way to church
dust devils in the road

awake
quake

remodeling plans
the whole house sways
earthquake!

trembling
the earth touches
us all

moving over the sea cliff
off shore rocks

earthquake
in the thrifty drug store
prices fall

beyond the bar
dancing lights the sun
in the harbor

the hills
touching each other
at the river

washed
hills dribble down
muddy waters

painted hills
morning freshens
the colors

mounding up a cloud
full of thunder

dirt-poor farmer
high on the hill
a priceless ocean view

mountain woman
cadence of rolling hills
in her breast

from underground

not far from the desert sun

rolled between islands

land's end
a rock crumbles
in damp sand

sweeping
out to the lighthouse
a long sand beach

landslide
years slipping away
from the cliffs

landslide
the cliff reveals
its other age

leaving
the lake waters
calm

valley lake
below sea level
dried salt

dark blue
coolness crosses the lake
in ripples

without stars
the sky eases pink
into the lake

meadow knowledge
by sleeping on the ground
death isn't bad

foaming between rocks
fragrance of seaside meadows
at high tide

the stillness
between tides
meadow fragrance

midnight meadow
lying in moonshadows
poison ivy

turning the earth
as mountains rise
they crumble

riverside cliffs
the current recycles
mountains

jagged blue
flames of evening
mountain peaks

lost paint box
mountains have borrowed
all the colors

desert misers
in a wide blue sky
one low mountain

lying in a meadow
kneecap to kneecap
with the mountain

sharpening my pencil
for another scribble

the slim edge

the setting sun
meets the moon

writing
on mountain peaks
tablets of stone

wrapped around
by mountains

at the summit

by a car door

bell tones of rocks
barely wet

summer
at the oasis
evening cool

the ebbing light
leaves shell pink

home to the ridge

sea foam
blowing from a wild surf
gulls

given depth
by a passing cloud
ocean colors

ocean wild
no need to see
a whale

summer day
the ocean invents
aquamarine

holding hands
a blazing log
-and ocean roar

squirting water
between old rocks the ocean
plays with itself

mighty river
a white line through
this pebble

torchlight
inviting rocks by the pond
to dance on water

green round pond
lily pads of late summer
mossy pennies

summer departs
the stagnant pond
stays right here

alone in the storm
anchored to a rocky reef
clang of a buoy bell

narrow river
opening just a crack
the wide ocean

white with foam
the ocean enters
the river's mouth

reservoir
an ancient river
refilled

river days
a stream of light
flows by

river mouth
bridged
by gulls

redwood roots
the river's course
bends and twists

deep below
running in the sea
other rivers

rushing river
brushes the air
with white ripples

walking the mountains
the river goes along
with us

mid-morning
the river refreshes itself
with a little breeze

the earth turns
now and then
the river bends

hot sun presses
water into a river
summer flood

from the river
winding up the river
a stream of cool air

sleeping
valley river sounds
dream

sleeping
below the noisy river
the other one

stopping by the river
sunlight
a bank of fog

rocky stream
a dropped feather
dyes it blue

dry riverbed
covered in the mornings
with puffy clouds

resting
the river
in its bed

streambed
bent to fit the earth
a fallen willow

face to face
with ancient rocks
the tourist touches hers

sea spray
a rock drawn in the air
its water shape

mountain boulders
breaking up
the light

desert rocks
listening to the music
of water

monoliths
holding the rosy sun
against blue night

broken rock
half hot
half cold

rocks
legends
in sand

rocks
leaving clearly
sand

rocks
in veins of ore
roots

magnetic
lines in the rock
writing it down

evening reflected
by glowing granite
lighted from within

rocks
at the foot of the bed
waves splash

water falls
on japanese landscapes
sea rocks

a crack
in the monolith
one star

the top of the rock
in the bottom of the pool
bright with sun

cracking a smile
faces in sandstone
slanted sun

splashing each other
centuries in the surf
brother rocks

after the rain
all the desert colors
in wet rocks

red rock walls
echo
blue rock walls

forces of nature
a sense of theater
with rocks

mountain peak
stars burned into rocks
glitter all day

high tide
lapping the fire
in a rock

road to the moon
between ash meadows
salt ponds

reflected
on the moon
salt flats

death valley
salts a bright blue lake
at twilight

earth fissures
lacing the pond
dried salt

the line
between water and hills
a salt sea

desert beach
green moss white
with salts

lining the hills
edges of the sea
with salt

rolling over
into dry sand
the 7th wave

snow-capped peaks
then the wave spreads
over a sandy beach

dark and growling
from land a summer storm
becomes a glass sea

lying low
before storm clouds
a smooth sea

distant horizon
sea miles marked
by different colors

water drawing
a straight line between
sea and sky

splashes
return to the sea
a dance

sea stacks
the white smoke
of spindrift

two crows land
with sun on their backs
sky country

undercurrents
below spindrift
a mellow flute

spindrift
above the ocean wave
a prayer flag

spindrift
a cloud hangs
where a wave broke

night fall
yet not one stone
moves

painting stones
a mountain brook moving
tree shadows

alluvial fans
the valley heat
on stone fields

shimmering
above the hot stones
summer sea

one stone
climbing the mountain
in my shoe

covered with stones
the stream makes a path
to the river

fire in the mist
rushing down the highway
far mountains

mountain path
the roundness of the earth
arches between my feet

poem maps
under summer feet
paths

midnight car
lining the coast
with highway one

headlights
on a rain-drenched pass
slanted sunlight

yellow line
on a black highway
last sun rays

desert highway
the poet writes a haiku
on the yellow line

mountains
twisting roads
in us

following the river
following the sun
through mountains

rivers
building roads
in mountains

desert paths
the smell of water
paving the way

without moving
our road goes from town to town
changing its name

a summer shower
the asphalt road
rising in steam

beach road
summer smooth
from sandy feet

a mountain
bends in the road
heaped high

mountain road
going and going and yet
time stands still

freeway
a truckload of art
passing tanks

dust
the road disappears
in itself

road
winding around the mountain
mountain views

down from the pass
still the black road
wiggles

in the stream
waiting for wind ripples
to move the mountain

this beach stream
hangs our sandals on two fingers
runs to the sea

an open window
surf sounds
square

night surf
the bright waves
of flame

surf's boom
sun beats into water
sound on metal

earth spins
surf sounds
in dry sand

boiling seas
into a wild surf
a hot sun

black cypress
draining into the swamp
strands of color

home again
a pulse of tides
in our blood

tilted
this side of the ocean
dries in the sun

dry rocks
bubbling up between
the incoming tide

incoming tide
the sun-dried rock
wetted

rattle of rocks
at high tide the stars
an earthly tone

night tide
black rocks blacker
as a dark moon

freshly washed hair
receding tide leaves
wet rocks

high and low
tides weaving
sand

the tide turns
a whoosh of wave
splashes white

pictures
in the burning wood
tide lines

rippling light
night tide flows back
to a sunlit sea

high tide
sharing a small beach
with wet feet

melting
in a tide pool
sun on still waters

deep in the earth
tremors in our knees
magnified

after tremors
in the fear and trembling
frog voices

rocks
crumble into valleys
evening colors

deepening
the lowest point in usa
night shadow

jagged mountains
the wide slope of valley
smoothes the air

mountain shadows
tracing valley contours
across the sky

layers of color
the cliff eases into valleys
blue dusk

san joaquin valley
sand walking valley
after all my years

queen valley
mother earth
full of gold

empty night sky
fills the desert valley
with city lights

the breaking wave
cough drop colored
cool mint

between rainclouds
sunlight slants
deep into valleys

mountain greatness
the gentle easing
into valleys

rainclouds
blowing into the valley
sunset's golden light

bell tones
of the country side
village names

evenings
setting the sky on fire
lava mountains

red into black
summit passes
into sunset

mid-day
heat of volcanoes
still in the rocks

lava rocks flowing
with the river
night-long shadows

lava rocks
flowing with the river
dry summer heat

black lava
pushing into bloodred
sunset peaks

sunshine
the tops of waves melting
into hard metal

sun in front
of each crested wave
its own radiance

night air
breathing deeply the waves
wet dry sand

walls of water
waves in rock
a tearing sound

waves crash
in the curve of the bay
unbroken by man

wave upon wave
sun beats the water
into a hard curve

earth turning
a wave rounds
the blue green

elephant rock
stomping on the beach
ocean waves

asleep
yet waves remember
to come ashore

a wave breaks
out in laughter
two people

waves
unrolling
seafoam

mounting up
a wave rides a rock
ashore

rolling in waves
the white foam clouds
thunder

solid waves
flowing into the surf
dunes

arching into the sky
the wave takes on
more blue

teary eyes
seeing with binoculars
salt waves

white laced waves
tearing silk
across the sand

each wave curves upward
catches a gleam of sunlight
then moves on

seas of silk
shapes without scissors
waves torn asunder

waves
feeling
time

a woman
a step down
a waterfall

taking to the waterfall
the everyday worries
washed away

mountain waterfall
fog flows backwards
into clouds

breath of angels
air of waterfalls
up one's nose

foot of the falls
tourists stopped
in their tracks

foot of the falls
the roaring opens
tourists' mouths

writing its name
on a granite cliff
water falls

quiet river
all of the wind
out of its falls

water drops
a radiance
in the falls

beyond the campfire
darkness draws together
the woods at night

airport
up in the smoke
faces i've met there

waiting area
mom and dad's faces
grounded

airport carpeting
the dizziness
above and below

before boarding
a finger on the wingtip
cold and sweaty

among strangers
sun rises without a night
flares on metal wings

barefoot
her sweat socks
still do

smooth sand
chasing children down the beach
their foot prints

watered silk
bright surf catches
her pants leg

a huge wave
rolling up her pants
still wet

missing the malls
on the ocean beach
she gathers shells

the fat child
gathers the most sea shells
pockets bulging

high tide
the beach leaves a mark
in her book

afternoon wind
all the beachcomber's words
blown out to sea

heat wave
on the beach crowds
cool fog

cold beach walk
on sun-warmed car seats
two sweatshirts

curls of waves
yet on the beach all day
her hair goes straight

smuggler's cove
stones wash on the beach
the size of skulls

a special beach
i put a pebble in my mouth
before leaving

car doors slam
essence of starfish comes
home with us

beachcomber
gift of civilization
a hairbrush

beach bums
at a sermon of gulls
one tries to sleep

smelling the light
on her tanned shoulder
home from the beach

cyclist
picking up a nail
from a crosswalk

flat country lane
a man on a bike
slices the sky

tourists
too tipsy to drive
out in a canoe

choppy waves
the small boat between
two worlds

behind the speedboat
water bent and broken
mends with ripples

streaked with gold
sunset in the rich folks harbor
the tallest mast

in a canoe
a man eating a banana
peeled

a summer day
drifting by
in a canoe

river's bend
wave lengths of setting sun
broken by a canoe

rowing on the lake
boats filled
with empty sounds

stopped down
by the river's pace
drifting boats

studying waves
he drifts off
to sleep

cabin closed
the waiting in the woods
as we come

the tiny cabin
listening to pine wind
its very own planks

early summer
cabin walls leaking
late night cold

back again
in the summer cabin
winter dreams

tin roof
hearing the edge of a cloud
wet with rain

warm dry air
the river low in august
a door opening

leaving for home
summer cabin floors
swept bare

camping
man's first home
a wall of green wind

pillared by pine
driftwood logs
slanted sunlight

a driftwood shack
remembering other times
places

fights forgotten
neighbor kids building
a club house

the open window
screened with a web
leaf shadows

remaking the bed
the river flows by
the campground

nearly awake
sea-gathered light
on sleeping faces

environmentally sound
wiping the new-age camper
with recycled paper

summertime
the way to the circus
childish voices

carousel
the sun goes around
up and down

berkeley sidewalks
the rest of my education
on the street

selling peace buttons
he buys the mulatto a coffee
room for the night

street woman
her tits at home
in t-shirts

city park
hands of the blind
sparrows

home from haying
the weight of a wooden rake
on sun burnt shoulders

a giving sound
wheat leans into
the mowing machine

it is still hot
tractors coming home
with headlights

sound of a fan
blowing a cool hole
back into summer

paper and sticks
the coolness of a ocean
painted on a fan

dry wind
the smell of smoke
bright red

hot moon
marked and spotted gray
by forest fires

plowing a firebreak
the dry earth
a cloud of smoke

clearing a trail
it only seems clean
after a shower

fruitstand
the girl-watcher pinches
a peach

your long letter
a garden around me
tall white summer skies

gardens
voices among flowers
patterned paths

evening song
the scythe set a stone
leans on the fence

snapping beans
she doesn't look up
when the gate slams

garden spider
at home in a hat
dangles at my ear

a new hoe
chopping the grasses
of last spring

cabbage gardener
seeing white butterflies
in a new light

long walk home
the incoming tide
refills footprints

hot stones
footprints of swimmers
going home

homeward bound
our days of vacation
in brown skin

driving in time
rivers flow backwards
as we leave the sea

going home
down the mountain road
sunset

leaving
the ocean waves
come back

tracks on the beach
all the feet have returned
to the city

welcome home
the far ridge filled
with thunder

coming home
to the rest of rain
all day long

the way home
a scent of open fires
clinging to my wrist

ginko   success
finding back home
sand between my toes

the weight of eyelids
home from the beach
full of sand

home again
a bath and the towel
with a blue border

hikers rest
at the waterfall
coming down to earth

heavy sweating
the taste of mountain
on a hot day

squeaky knee joints
canyon river sounds
coming up the hill

canyon springs
where water rest in light
travelers pause

going down the mountain
its rocky river words
still in our ears

tired bones
back-packed in
a mountain hike

the back of my hand
he said
and we were lost

looking down
the tops of trees
rooted in the canyon

hitch hiker
leaving the no-camping area
his pack all lumpy

one path
heel to toe
and warm

mountain climbers
their voices higher
than the rocks

climbers
effortless the assent
of their voices

soft pink hills
the hiker invited to rest
way over there

in the valley
stretched to the setting sun
soles of hiker's feet

hikers resting
yet the mountain moves
its morning shadow

humming
pomp and circumstances
mountain hikers

mountain hikers
morning as wide
as spirit shapes

sierra hike
taking john muir's word
home again

hitch-hiker
on the picnic basket
several small bugs

hitch hikers
a car full of flies
going to la

sun on her knee
stuck on raspberry jam
dripping through toast

august beaches
for moms and crabs
the nitty-gritty

teenagers
tumbling on the sands
over-playful waves

afternoon quiet
the grandson's crayon
melts on the porch

evening clouds
stretched low on the horizon
a child's name being called

on her breast
brightness next to shadow
of lace

ocean foam
all night the loveliness
of a lace gown

laundry day
the gardenia blooms
clear white

billowing white
filled with a summer day
clouds on a clothesline

laundry dries
a change of sea wind
dampens it again

bottom of the basket
the sandy beaches
of dirty clothes

home again
the mountain that remains
laundry

land's end
the low star turns
into a lighthouse

the lighthouse
mirrors over the sea
a yellow pyramid

two lollipops
wrapped in cellophane
matching sisters

a noon nap
rock shadows
restless

picking up sleep
where you left it at dawn
afternoon nap

roadside rest stop
getting out of the car
all the tiredness

not really tired
a summer day
lays down to rest

beach sand
measuring a poet
stretched out

waking
shadows from a nap
have moved

slick rock faces
climbers' strain
against the rope

dots of shadow
climbing the mountain
flute notes on both sides

to the summit
to view the lowest point
in the valley

ridge dark
in town
a good movie

outdoor movies
around the old films
moths

after the show
the smell of rain
on hot asphalt

summer afternoon
the coolness of white
naked on a quilt

moss green bank
the woman reclining nude
as is the river

nude beach
nothing new
under the sun

naked
on the porch
passion flowers

newborn
swimming in the river nude
on your birthday

on the nude beach
from her tits to her toes
it's saturday night

outdoor flute concert
the second movement
the wind

singing low
sea white fog disappears
in an outdoor concert

following strings
stars hum along
with the guitar

harpsichord
tightened spinal cords
jangle

hot summer night
all that jazz
shared by neighbors

going insane
radio rock
a block away

stop light
music from other cars
perfume

in her hands
coming out of the hills
clay pots

beach clay
in her hands palm prints
a vase for flowers

how quiet
the cove where divers left
their trash

dune buggies
in the desert night
electric fireflies

dune buggies
nights in valley lights
parked

inspiring view
eating cereal
with a pencil

row upon row
torn from a notebook
mountain lines

sea painting
a child's water color box
full of sand

watercolor paper
stopping a wave
with a brush

sunlight
trying to paint highlights
on tops of waves

waves
following the brush
into a watercolor

the beach giving lessons
in making waves

a sunday painter
the lighthouse just as big
as a gnarled thumb

dried up
in a box of paints
summer sea colors

a hummed tune
painting a wave
realistic

in exchange
for a special rock
flute notes

a gentle breeze
river willows not moving
lost fishing lines

looking up
from the crime story
passion flowers

as everyone knew
poets who write by the sea
are all wet

empty
desert notebook
fills with sand

the book closed
yet hearing the poems
thunderstorm

green faded ribbon
the english lute
hangs songs on a nail

sounds of a harp
drifting into the forest
into birdsong

in rows
bees and his lips
at harmonica holes

tuning the dulcimer
legs of a spider
crawling out

country market
the humane society sponsors
a flea market

alone
the world stops
just to find it

raspberry jam
on a peanut butter sandwich
high noon lips

weathered picnic tables
after the summer shower
mustard stains wet

ocean view
tourists taking photos
leaving trash

tourists
taken by the view
snapshots

curved
on the ground lens
a wind-swept pine

sunset
when the show's the best
the lights go out

canyon rim photo
after the click he sees
his toes in space

loaded with cameras
donkeys with a master's degree
in photography

worn smooth
the wind-swept cedar
everyone photographs

in the desert
a sudden whirring
camera's automatic rewind

crumpled
silver sunshine
on a photo

summer afternoon
filling the pool
with neighbor's kids

at the gynecologist
knitting a baby blanket
for the seventh grandchild

restless waves
tourists
newly arrived

restless sea
houses of folks
taking it easy

night rocks
in beach fog
drunken voices

newcomers
digging their toes in sand
cliffs of california

playing my flute
indians
ten thousand years ago

aborigines
my mind still fits
the grinding place

desert
bare bones
living

watering the desert
a small yellow stream
between her feet

uphill
a load of firewood heats
wheelbarrow handles

mountain lights
the glow of candles
in jelly glasses

rusty pump
cussing and swearing
it goes again

campfire
cooking clouds
in oyster stew

showering with stars
sandy soap

outdoor shower
in a path of moonlight
surf sounds

outdoor tub
bathing in the scent of pine
still on the trees

city girl
how to brush her teeth
with a wet finger

in the tub
heat of the day
goes down the drain

squatting over earth
just as i pee
thunder

drought
the scorched earth
where he always pees

sleeping on the floor
an indian rug curls up
beside me

wakeful hours
bending a square of moonlight
a rag rug

dried prune faces
guests when they hear
we have only a privy

stern child
on the wall behind the hippie
her baby picture

all day outlines
dust on her sandals
where toes were

hot weather
wearing the day
all night

summer moon
patterns on the porch
a crazy quilt

summer evening
the porch swing moves
a new moon

high tide
waves breaking loud
around my pillow

night bushes
the candle's flame
red in animal eyes

lost
in the night stars changing
the summer sky

a canopy bed
covered with summer stars
airy blankets

mountain winds
sleeping all night
with open mouths

asleep
light from the sea
in her face

dawn
stars turning into
mosquitoes

waking up
the itch of bug bites
brand new

grand canyon
a hole in the ground
filled with mountains

point arena lighthouse
snags the morning sun
and $300 each

unfenced precipice
he remembers as unpaid
life insurance

japanese journey
sacramento rice fields
and mount lassen

stars
carried into caves
tourists' candles

indian cave
songs still
wind

cave dwellers
the grinding stone
hollow

bringing home
memories
of indian caves

caution
in the petrified forest
no smoking signs

harbor town bells
on saturday night
buoys

rock woman
facing into desert sun
her sky-blue eye

holland
flattened against the sky
warmed at the edges

salton sea
its blue also covers
the far hills

on every road
canals with drawbridges
for pictures

country villages
the sloped roofs huddle
against green growing

before their doorways
in the hour before darkness
people as statues

in the museum
yellow flowers floating
a glass paperweight

seeing my face
in the crowd i bought
the mirror

naked breasts
wearing only the dark lace
shadows of her straw hat

her straw hat
asleep by the garden
of noon-day sun

eyes closed
only my breast to view
the sea

off-shore breeze
coming to land
on bikini bodies

cooling the sand
the fat lady's shadow
on a hot day

evening deepens
the tan on her legs
with varicose veins

grains of sand
days of a life
lying on a beach

silence
to seek and wrap around
the body nothing

tanned
except for the places
a fly sits

bodies
given to the desert
sun

hot bathed body
dried by desert
stars

sun-bathing
conservationists
saving water

evenings
drawing closer to the fire
sunburnt faces

green waves
florescent with surfers
in mod wetsuits

sleeping in the sun
only surfer dreams
ride the bright waves

surfers
black suited
among seals

rationed water
in the desert
our wet places

bright blue armpits
the indigo blouse fades
into a hot day

beach day
evening turning
flesh to fire

lumbago's dull pain
a summer breeze frisks
by the bed

feverish
on a hot day defrosting
the refrigerator

summer colds
the neighbor's dog barks
when we cough

on one hand
the liver spots of aging
poison ivy

churning seas
love-making
in the hot tub

making love
into hot tub foam
falling stars

an undriven nail
caught in the lighthouse
at land's end

between our legs
dancing flames
in a fire place

log to ashes
clocks
our love-making

after the tryst
the red candle gutted
yet  comes sunrise

ocean waves pound
the tattoo on his arm
blue skin

the rocky river
our knees a buzz
with the current

swimmers
afternoon heat
underwater

salt crystal ripples
washing shells on my feet
toenails

sitting in the river
rhythmic waves between my legs
does it for me

taking heat
down from the ridge
into the river

hills and valleys
a woman lying flat
in the river

an old woman
swimming the august stream
the mossy smell

catching the big one
a fat old lady hauls out
on the nude beach

swimming alone
the drag of undertow
mom calls

tea house
fresh air fills the cup
with green tree

date groves
palms waving
at single tourists

bound by a bell
strangers in the street
of ancient churches

good for the tongue
names of norwegian
home-cooked food

sidewalks of paris
the smell of coffee
on a foreign tongue

nasal tones
long bread under dark blue

shutting the door
not shutting out

into another window

by the window
a fireplace joins
the lighthouse

to live among birds

birds fly on
stepping stones of a still pond
cloud to cloud

landing
a wing spread with light
folds into feathers

what is a branch
and what is a bird leg?
the answer flies away

in the bird's open beak
only the wind

bird call arcs to call
in answers

for a name

of flight

waiting at the corner
only a butterfly
and this lovely girl

walking
with a butterfly
here i too pause

following it out of sight
a butterfly

before the hot sun
white on the butterfly's wing
melted transparent

of a dove

a nest
found in autumn
the empty sky

empty afternoon

with tears

as empty as
sunday afternoon's envelope

filling the washer
with an empty heart
your blue shirts

locking emptiness
into summer cabins

filling the emptiness
evenings

loaded on a truck
without wheels

rain drops in my eyes
for clearer vision

grandkids leaving
the only smiles
on pictures they drew

leaving
the low tide beach
fills

facing one another
the chairs open and empty
as guests leave

weak fall sun
chairs by the cafe sit
on each other's lap

leaving
dust holds your footprints
and me

walking on rocks
where tears splashed down
dad's farewell

wind-filled rain
tears at the leaves
someone is going

guests gone
the only stars
in the sieve

guests gone
huckleberries ripen
in the silence

noodle soup
memories of your visit
in the left-overs

kissing good-bye
she feels the edge
of his pocket

leaving germany
raindrops in my eyes
tears

autumn's summer heat
on a white paper you drew
a smiling sun

to sleep alone
in the light of the moon
madness

loneliness
crossing the great plains
high tension wires

a lonely day
yet in the afternoon
a breeze comes by

alone
in the desert
wind

on the porch
mold-speckled pine needles
my waiting for you

a son's call
white waves of long distance
returning to shore

kids gone
sea waves return to shore
each alone

foggy saturday night
a woman's whiskey-raw voice
pours from a radio

singing low
sea-white fog disappears
beneath the pines

divorced parents
the cries of the neighbor kids
deep in the woods

the waitress' tip
lying in spilled beer
small brown coins

dreams
burning desire
burning

burning pine
smoke blown about
my longing

deer at the salt lick
so my memories of us
will you return too?

fireplace sunshine
dark in the burned-out cabin
weeds

too late
lovers looking in windows
of closed shops

touching your left sleeve
at this moment of parting
how cold is your coat

watercolor class
a blue sky pinned to the wall
falls

a deaf child
in autumn hearing
the sleep of seeds

lost
in hidden valley
the trail

on the gramophone
a church in holland
where you are tonight

early morning sun
on the face of the clock
time change

time was
my eyes in the empty place
where the clock isn't

golden clock hands
sunshine slants through leaves
passing time

moon dreams
a spotlight turns on
past lives

fingernails
windows to the past
lives

white waves returning
to shore their call
for me to come home

low-tide walk
now deep at sea
my path

at the waterfalls
a woman remembering
a love affair

at least the moon
when it's full
comes to my porch

ribbon knots
tighten a lump in the throat
as it was that night

heavy heart
such a color evenings
weighs nothing

taking a rest
i let the city noises
leak out of my ears

pillar of sorrow
the hours alone
touching it

deep sighing
waves climb the beach
and disappear

earth turns
shadows on a face
fade
and reappear

stepping stones
go wobbly and uneven
tears falling

autumn sadness
yet before the leaf falls
the swelling bud

eyelash splash
curve in the folding
a wave of tears

the cutting edge
your words where the moon
touches night

yet another pine
is the moon ever free
of the earth?

spirit of a place
a film
on the photograph

breathing heavily
atop the mountain gorge
a thick cloud

knuckles of night
cold without human flesh
tap along the roof

forces
holding rocks together
apart

mountain top
aglow with the unseen
moon

walking paths
the land fluid
without feet

after death
naming the unknown
heaven earth

voices
familiar things
without shadow

doors
swinging pendulums
between outsiders

moon shadows
coming up the stairs
a creaking sound

between two birds
in bright shapes
a real name

flagstones
then the border blew away
in colored silk

surf sounds
someone was walking
on trackless sand

bad dreams
the shapes of dinner
eaten late

night bumps
all around the house
other things

spindrift veils
above the crashing waves
finer ones

without wind
a door opens
the candle goes out

a stand of trees
in a setting of weeds
someone kneeling

standing ajar
for the passage of souls
a door in october

incense
smoke in the wind chimes
faint tones of blue

bones
hearing sea winds of the dead
in
flute tones

secret mists
on the broad river
lost shadows

lost shadows
on the dark river
time curves

a creaking floor
the moonlight goes
from room to room

moon path
on the water where i walk
a bridge to

sunset
the shadow steps back
into your heel

two foreign stamps
found in a dream book
borrowed

walking on the mountain
without a step
going inside of it

still alive
in knotty pine walls
dragon eyes

without words
angels' voices return
songs

giant forest
moving between trees
a deeper darkness

giant forest
walking the dark road
night trees

at the pass
a bright neon-blue bush
the future

mineral waters
perfume the skin
a bright soul

lizard
in the slits of his eyes
my soul window

beach wind
taking off her prayer cap
unseen temple

many night thoughts
the big dipper tilts
spilling over

all saints' day
pumpkin-grin fangs
gone with the werewolf

all saints' day
goblins and witches baptized
with holy names

all saints' day
the jack-o-lantern
full of gnats

all saints' day
the moldy pumpkin
grins with a harelip

all saints' day
filling the pumpkin's eyes
with raindrops

all saints' day
among the fall colors
angel food cake

all souls' day
the end table
bow-legged

moon shadows
the doormat comes alive
with a cat's leap

pleasant ridge
all the caskets
side by side

sleeping peacefully
the best western motel
by the cemetery

grave marker
as a cradle headboard
rest in peace

abandoned cemetery
iron keys cross the ground
no one going in

open grave
the iron shovel lifts
autumn fragrance

clods from the grave
sweet potatoes piled in a field
join at the fence

death valley
emigrant tombstones
mountain peaks

a blob of catsup
on the postcard
the missing kiss

mother
wearing her shoes
to her funeral

up in smoke
all those years
of her anger

the calling
of funeral bells
a shoestring breaks

an open mouth
funeral bells fill
earth gap

funeral mountains
at sunset a halo
of golden clouds

the bell tolls
rolling the full moon
out of darkness

burial
driving a car into the trees
behind the barn

sundown
in ghost town darkness
two crows

ghost town
in an abandoned orchard
fresh apples

ghost town road
in a cloud of red dust
a dump truck

wind
in the waterfall
white ghosts

wind in the willows
ghost of a woman
basket gathering

white moon
filling death valley
ghosts

ghosts
in the
joshua trees

snake
death

ghosts
joshua trees
shape-changing

dark night
old sheets turning into
halloween ghosts

in the fog
ghosts by the cliffs
change into gulls

the godless month
busy with preparations
for christmas

halloween
being scared to sweep
under the bed

thunderstorms
the sky saying boo
on halloween

halloween weirdness
the old fence post sprouts
a pumpkin face

deserted house
wild roses still have a view
of the remote coast

vacant stares
from the vacant house
no one looks

natives
guided through the desert
by
water spirits

desert wind
whistling through bird bones
indian breath

indian country
sign on a winding road
a broken arrow

navajo sandstone
face of a rock
weeping

emerald pools
in navajo sandstone
indian red

navajo sandstone
fissures opening
to heaven

painted
on indian cave walls
lizard eyes

prayer flags
ground shadows
in weird shapes

prayer flags
tinkling
bells

vehicles to heaven
pray flags surround
the used car lot

remembering mom
the same old fire
in an altar candle

an altar candle
lit for your soul journey
warms my hands

pumpkin pies
remembering with a grin
the jack-o-lantern

light
from the pumpkin's grin
a full moon

moonrise
wind blows out the light
in the pumpkin

carved pumpkin
admiring our art the moon
comes on the porch

enlightened
the jack-o-lantern
has a fat candle

alone
going to sleep with a grin
on the pumpkin

all the light
inside of a pumpkin
this dark night

light leaking
the grin of pumpkins
growing moldy

together
lifting the pumpkin
the curved stem

night dark
inside the pumpkin
its warm glow

scary halloween
the candle in the pumpkin
goes out

watching our bed
the pumpkin's lid
smokes

bedside candle
putting it in
the pumpkin

shadows moving
on the bedroom wall
a pumpkin's grin

unable to sleep
the jack-o-lantern watches
us all night

grandpa
gives the jack-o-lantern
his snag-toothed grin

kite string
tightly rolled
first day of school

just moved
the chill of giggles
in the school yard

backpack of books
the schoolboy becomes
a deformed monster

first day of school
her bare foot tracks
still on the beach

mid-september
she writes her name for daddy
in the sand

where we shook hands
in front of our old school
a dark bruise

after all these years
the high school band
still practices

still an old maid
the high school latin teacher
on a sentimental journey

first day of school
on the mountain ridge
clouds without thunder

voices along the road
after the school bus goes by
only birds

river so low
all the polliwogs gone
school begins

beach afternoon
school girls drinking
from a paper bag

sea horizons
the soul stretched
into bands of blue

in the headlights
thud of a dark body
a soul rushes by

colorful indian corn
for thanksgiving dinner
relatives from afar

thanksgiving day
an old couple on the pier
fishing

cold turkey
in bed on thanksgiving
with the sniffles

thanksgiving day
seeing an old neighbor
after her surgery

thanks giving
the first cup of water
tipped to the earth

thanksgiving day
after the storm
beachcombing

thanksgiving day
grapes on an heirloom plate
half-eaten

desert thanksgiving
cold turkey sandwiches
under the one tree

blood relatives
for thanksgiving dinner
red beets

trick or treating
with kids only the moon
older than i

without a soul
faces grin in the dark
on halloween

no one home
yet a face grins on the porch
halloween

going into dark times
children dressed as grown-ups
begging

from india
the strange white bird
in a yoga position

banner of belief
lace at the edges
crumbling

granite altar
water not wine
wind flowing

ancient shrine
just a roof
upon the path

chapel
hidden on the ceiling
pagan symbols

cloister walls
shutting in
the outer world

holy mountain
among the bishop pines
bluebirds

late to church
daylight saving
unholy times

back home
covered with dust
magic sparkles

before the coven
how the witches park
their cars

new age witch
in her honda
a whiskbroom

magic symbols
drawn with blood
this holy space

eggshells ashbone
white of the moon
in a witch's spell

a little spilled wine
ageless women in the circle
of a full moon

falling from the wreath
frost
flowers

a wave curls
tumbling over a wreath
buried at sea

the vietnam vet
in his eyes
my debt

late afternoon
water leaking out
of the cove

afternoon nap
a visit with angels
how you snore

between fingers
the empty air
of afternoon

cricket silence
between scraping sounds
autumn begins

the sky
because it is that old
that blue

october's
bright blue weather
out to sea

blue sky
coming into the tree's shadow
salt winds

blue autumn skies
folded into mountains
purple shadow

night winds blow
on the cabin bed
another quilt

autumn
taking a dirt road
to the end of it

a summer hike
in mountain shadows
finding autumn

clouds
turning off the lights
outside the house

mountain stream
afternoon clouds washed
out to sea

shy before the moon
she too slips behind
autumn clouds

mountain cold
getting under a blanket
to sleep with me

white fish fillet
the sky fills up
with cooler air

after the shower
cool wind in the bathrobe
hangs on a nail

canyon click
nothing on film
like the cold wind

in the dark of night
who would have thought
rain was round

dark castle
atop the mountain
rain clouds

one at a time
rainclouds falling
dark into the sea

rainy night
the path home
a black umbrella

the roof
leaves in a drought year
in the rain gutter

dusk
last light caught
in tears

darkness
the wideness of things
fills the distance

at dusk
voices call out
stars

tangled branches
coming darkness
woven in

a wave breaks white
a gull folds its wing
as the sea darkens

autumn wind
the way it turns things around
at dusk

dusk
the room larger than the persons
filling it

dusk
shaking out the tablecloth
a whir of wings

eclipse
white rocks in the garden
bright round

just now
with the incoming tide
supper time

evenings
the long pale waves
come ashore

evening comes
wrapped in sea fog
tied with webs

evening sea fog
descending into sun-dried grass
sweaty lovers

evening ebb tide
the beach widens
into a flat sea

evening glow
dark the sea
shot with color

evening
waves come into the cove
one at a time

dust
so fine the evenings
golden air

evening as it is
the light lays hot
upon our eyelids

evening
corners move into the room
blown by dark

evening
in a secret cove
fog bound

evening wind
colors of the day
blown away

evening winds
the tiny bay filled
up to the cliff

somber at eventide
faces in sandstone
approaching autumn

autumn equinox
cool wind comes scented
sun-hot pine needles

autumn equinox
putting porch furniture away
getting it out again

fall equinox sun
coming through cedar box trees
anthology plans

fog moves
as children's hands wave good-bye
sunday evening

whiteness
fog erasing the landscape
history

sea fog
blowing in the valley
shapes of hills

broken fence
river valley fog patches
the gaping holes

sadness
fog leaving
the sea

fog shrouded
a sky without directions
the unknown way

ocean roar
washing dishes
with fog

gray foggy days
womb warm with light filtered
through a membrane

closing
the notebook
fog

more fog
in the notebook
nothing

alone together
behind us fog closed
the golden gate

the wind's eye
against the glass
a hurricane

indian summer
the cold on my teeth
iced tea

moon spirits
the face of the deep
lightly misted

november spirits
playing in the meadow
wisps of mist

rolling hills
hiding stars
in autumn mists

left and right
the moon bounces over
a mountain road

painted hills
the moon of white
is real

moon
full of blue light
desert cool

into valleys
a moon full
of valleys

headed out to sea
the tide-pulling moon
in the rear view mirror

desert tides
the moon shapes
sand stone

a little higher
another valley fills
with the moon

quivering branch
the moon climbs higher
in the old pine

opening the door
for more firewood
there's the moon

from barren trees
shaking wildly
serene moves the moon

fields flat with fog
the radiance of the moon
fenced with rough slats

moonsky
starlight bends and fades
into a halo

higher from earth
the mountain moon
brightens

radiance expands
the moon blows free
of a rumpled earth

white moon
filling the dry valley
with light

in hot springs
the moon warms itself
between us

gurgling
in mineral waters
the moon bathed

each step
up the mountain
the moon whiter

evening mountains
a line of milky blue
round the moon

a rack of clouds
arranged by the moon
in shapes of white

peeking thru pines
bright eye of the moon
my neighbor

crevices
in the face of rock
the moon

full white moon
the colored earth
rolls around

rounding
soft old hills
an ancient moon

moonbeams
the tender roots of passion
flowers

a crescent moon
earth cut off from heaven
by the fog

crescent moon
a bowl of brightness
full of night

hollow
in the dark of the moon
howling

a dark moon
the cold white rim
of an enamel pan

close to my moon
jupiter with all of his
brightens the night

face of the moon
in the hot tub
a swirl of bubbles

moon clouds
cooling the mountain side
a sunless shape

spotlight
between rocks
a bit of moon

white light
burning up rocks
moon magic

dark world
only rocks bright
where the moon goes

moving rocks
moon rolls over the mountain
none fall

doorknob
the moon looks down
on its tiny self

rocks
piled before the moon
drop back to earth

the full moon
walking the island road
from sea to sea

full moon
ripples reflecting
unseen stars

so full
the moon brightens the room
with poems

all moon
filling the secret cove
with bright water

a full moon
drawing down to the sea
a path of stars

faint with dews
the full moon slides
closer to the sea

full moon
holes in stones
echoes

mountain
giving birth to white light
a round moon

full moon
sculpting sandstone
with light

full moon
letting him in
with the light

full moon
rising over ash mountains
alkali dust clouds

from earth
a light moon rises
tides

moonrise
in the rear-view mirror
sunset

full moon
covering the long dry valley
with light

desert cool
rising to the full moon
desert pool

a full moon
cutting a lock
from the cowlick

cabin alone
the greater moon waits
our return

a full moon
the crazy neighbor's lights
burn all night

closing a slim book
print shrinks in the face
of a full moon

bending the pine tree
with a windy sound
the full moon

filling the river
the complete moon covers
the hole in the bridge

touching her face
fingerprints on the full moon
clouds

a full moon
resting on hoary frost meadows
tundra swans

full moon moves
from poem to poem
through the pine

round moon
rolling from the ridge
gray stones here and there

harvest moon
watching a mouse hole
the ginger cat

turning out the light
renting the room to the moon
for a night

a hazy moon
steam no longer seen
from the hot tub

clear moon
rising from a mountain ridge
darkness on its face

smudged moon
marked by mountain fires
soot and smoke

a hunter's moon
the o's of howling dogs
ring in the mists

late rising
the lop-sided moon
half the night

night
without poems
then comes the moon

late moon
in the poor part of town
second-hand light

the tiny dawn
pine mountain releases
the late moon

ripe huckleberries
the moon comes up
streaked with purple

late moon
shivering before mountains
cold knees

a falling star
the nearly round moon
still not full

clear night
moonlight coats
feathers

brushing moonlight
across night skies
wispy clouds

moonlight
on the way to dawn
vivid dreams

green water
curls into white foam
moonlight

pale violet sheets
in silver moonlight
native hills

moonlight
in the high desert
a river

moonlight
faces in the sandstone cove
laughing

one half a cup
of low-fat cottage cheese
in the moonlight

a window slants
from a rough stone fireplace
a square of moonlight

dancing around
in the moonlight
outstretched hands

nothing moves
moonlight touching wind
chimes

containing
a dish of moonlight
ritual salt

moonlight radiance
behind clusters of dark pine
white clouds

beach sand
wet with moonlight
ebb tide

moonlight
following raccoons
across the porch

alone
how cold the moonlight
on my bed

sitting in moonlight
the empty chair full
of radiance

in my bed
a spot of moonlight
the empty pillow

out to cool
on the porch cakes frosted
with moonlight

promontory
holding up moonlight
crevices of sea caves

moonlight
clothes from the dryer
fresh and clean

moonlight
slipping from her breasts
the white blanket

covered with moonlight
the face of the mountain
my wrinkles

a rock fantasy
shaped by moonlight
fears

moonlight highway
yellow crossing yellow
line of pee

mountain road
winding road
with a yellow line

mountain road
the glow in the moonlight
a night snake

moonlight
reflected from rocks
into haiku

a little higher
another valley fills
with moonlight

autumn leaves
arranging on the earth
silver moonlight

glacier-scarred rock
centuries of moonlight
echo

moonlight
in canyon echoes
stars

moonlight
your image on the mountain
echoes forever

eastern peaks
withholding moonlight
echo your voice

moonlight
in the mountain river
stars echo

moonlight
shaped by leaves of gold
silver

mountains
holding up the moonlight
the highest peak

two headlights
four white eyes
of moonlight

moonlight
broken to bits
by fallen leaves

draping moonlight
over your image
a leafless tree

rolling to the crest
moonlight touches each
tree black

autumn
leaves on the earth
silver moonlight

a black stove
warming a square
of moonlight

round rocks
the new moon rises
old

water striders
on a pale pond
moons

cactus spines
above the desert
a slender moon

incoming tide
curves of spindrift flung high
a quarter moon

sewing by hand
slowly it comes together
the half-round moon

quarter moon
on the night table
a book face up

quarter moon
such a face of darkness
yet you go to him

my longing
voices ask the moon
for news of him

awake
waiting for the moon
him

waiting for moonrise
the scribbled haiku
illegible

washing dishes
that half of the moon
makes them shine

mountain winds
half the moon
blown away

reflecting
on the quarter moon
broken granite

alone in the hot tub
the quarter moon seems
only half there

rising
above lava mountains
the cratered moon

sparks
above the rising moon
a plane lands

fire my companion
too faithful to go outside
see the cold moon rise

a rising moon
her scoop-necked blouse
moves with her breath

unable to hold back
moonrise
the cry of pleasure

over mountains
the moon rises roughly
scarred

moon rise
winds from those barren rocks
moving black pines

scratching his back
from crooked pines
rises the moon

pine needles
radiating light from dark limbs
moon rise

moon rise
waiting in darkness
all of us trees

salty sea fogs
on closed meadow flowers
moon rainbows

mountain pass
night's bright rainbow
a haloed moon

full moon
in a veil of clouds
round rainbows

moon shadows
writing letters deep
into the night

in my moon shadow
the neighbor's gray cat
warms itself

moon shadows
when the wispy clouds
blow free

moon shadow
curving into darkness
fear

moon shadows
writing in a journal
daydreams

darkness
sinking into the sea
craters of the moon

stars scattered
a few fishing boats gather
by the sinking moon

showers pass
on each dark stone
a tiny round moon

moon set
now it's right  how it fits
half moon bay

full the moon
setting into the sea
earth fragrance

midnight
the full moon shines
a bit flat

going out to sea
the moon fills spaces
with my eyes

growing bright
a fog bank at sea
melts the moon

night cooler now
the moon has slipped
into the sea

guiding the moon
into the sea
boat lights

pulling its path
down into the sea
the sinking moon

a brightness
smudging the night
the moon is gone

easing the moon
into gentle seas
your snoring

among starfish
the changing moon sinks
into the sea

moonset at dawn
the sea floor dark
and without water

cold moon
slipping into the sea
the octopus' eye

damp and dim
half the moon
in the water

scattering bright stars
the spent moon sinks
into the sea

bending down
sea clouds slip free
once more the moon

drawn to the porch
by the gold of the moon
sinking into the sea

a huge white wave
the foam becomes
the sinking moon

the moon has set
a cold smell
in the fireplace

shivering
the moon sinks
into cold seas

moon set
a glass of milk
to stay awake

grand canyon
cold to the rim
moon snow

moon valleys
shimmering in the shadows
beads of light

waning
the moon comes north
enters my window

ebb tide
the moon and anemone
no longer round

down the highway
the waxing moon comes
to half moon bay

rising
out of the weight of mountains
moon and cool breeze

flying by
the wind-swept moon
bent pines

spinning
out of the mountain's darkness
white moon winds

moon wind
the full radiance sails
from the rippled ridge

pine-needle clusters
redrawing the moon
each gust of wind

autumn morning
a torn shoulder muscle
wakes first

eastern peaks
autumn stains the morning sky
red and gold

first cold dawn
using my old straw hat
to start the fire

morning dews
coming out a cedar house
the whole forest

autumn nights
filling the wind
with other things

night
rocks soften
disappear

darkness
light's last rays lose
a name

daylight goes
yet we shall stay here
where the stars are

world thick
slat cabin walls
on dark nights

nights
light broken into stars
neighbor's lights

shore-line nights
by waves of darkness
the air shaped

river bends
into the summer sun
autumn's ocean

late afternoon
giant boulders dry
letting the tide ebb

a line of sea foam
the ocean hesitates
and then recedes

low tide
alone on the beach
autumn

a door slams
out in the bay
a wave collapses

low clouds
pressing the sea
flat

autumn sea fog
coming the same way
sadness

shorter days
the clothesline doesn't reach
the sun

a gust of wind
earth tosses up a sky
of fallen leaves

i'm not old
all night my eyes have held
ancient stars

a starry night
somewhere a windmill creaks
as the earth turns

so loud
the noise of stars one can't hear
the wind

evening star
under the dark wings
of gulls

autumn storms
shaking moonlight
from leaves

thunder
neighbor with a leaky roof
nails faster

before the storm
sunset clouds too
all mixed up

full storm fury
the quarter moon beams down
just quiet

such a storm!
on the roof are falling
all the stars

sea-storm clouds
bodies by michaelanglo
ring the horizon

out of storm
heavy clouds letting down
night

moon halo
keep us safe
from tomorrow's storm

talk of war
unpredicted a storm
blows in

sun setting
in beach sand
blue pits

with the sun ball gone
gold pours the horizon wide
sky to sea

sunset
sky and sea dyed golden
from a smallish ball

sea sky line
drawing the sun down
distorted

for tired eyes
after sunset gentle colors
releasing the light

evening sun
in that place tomorrow
i won't be

sunset
moonset leaving alone
low tide

summit peaks
scraping a sulfur match
at sunset

sunset
lighting a blaze
in a dark fireplace

stumbling
the sky at dusk
a bruise

sunset
painting wet sand
purple

wide horizons
spreading the colors
of a long-gone star

munching gingersnaps
desert mountains swallow
the evening sun

sunset
lighting a fire
in cedar logs

sunset rays
stringing masts together
the city skyline

sunset
warming each incoming wave
a secret cove

sunset
the cresting wave
catches fire

beyond the mountain
the setting sun
other friends

ocean coast
bending into a bay
sunset rays

coming ashore
each wave brings gold
from the setting sun

sun setting
into broken clouds
shore lights

scattered pastels
the sun sets its colors
here and there

evening sun
blown by sea wind
into an island

the burned place
in the sky
at sunset

horizons
the full moon at sunset
circling

tops of thunderclouds
sharing with us mortals
last rays of the sun

the sun sank
into a bar of clouds
missing the sea

sundown
the unheated ocean
ice blue

light on the sea
from a sunken island
sunset

sunset on a wall
through uneven stones
starlight

twilight
purple mountains sink
into purple sky

sun-warmed
the smell of earth
hides the moon

rolling downhill
moon watchers hike
up the mountain

in the dark
two trees on the ridge
found by the moon

waiting for moonrise
the page darkens
with poems

curved light
carved out of the hill
moonrise

hand hidden
in the soul given to others
her venus pulse

shooting arrows
autumn winds shred
the straw target

wind
measuring time
in her breast

autumn winds
the smell of a fingernail
torn loose

mountains
rocked to sleep
by gusty winds

autumn wind
a river from the evening star
into the sea

wind
on a starless night
the way home

night winds
binding the house
with darkness

white dew
from cinder clouds
moon clouds

white dew
rising from cinder peaks
morning clouds

white dew
finding places everywhere
i can't sleep

cinders
forgotten
thoughts

lava hills
ashes sparsely covered
with ghost weeds

lava pumice
the part-time cook
recognizes something

canyon walls
curved enough for clouds'
shadows to climb

desolate canyon
with only one note
a bird calls

desolate canyon
the apple rotten
at the core

canyon rim rocks
dwarf pines cling
with every root

canyon rim
something in me flies
over precipices

canyon rim walls
the sound of zippers
going up down jackets

canyon silence
skims the wind
a roar at the rim

music box canyon
wind in the dry river
like water running

canyon ledges
stones return the music
to wind

cemetery wind
sounds in the shells
of one's ears

all of their possession
side by side
cemetery plots

out of the cemetery
the first laugh
a cold wind

thunder
knees on graveyard earth
tremble

their eyes closed
to a million dollar view
a seaside cemetery

crossroads cemetery
the old man asks
the way home

buried here
autumn woods are full
of ancestors

riverside cemetery
late in autumn
chilled waters still

leaving the cemetery
sunrise
on frost-cracked soil

burial ground
naked trees veil
the sunrise

walking the land
that has taken my parents
their years

wheels of the hearse
packing the powdery snow
into useless patterns

swirling white clouds
on the desert floor
dust devils

neighbors
on the road in litigation
dust devils

crater winds
blowing back in
a thousand years

crater
where the earth exploded
a couple argue

photographing
the graves
without film

church bells
a spade cuts through
stony ground

open grave
frosted air penetrates
deep into earth

tending the graves
the dirt under my nails
is just a beginning

childless
standing beside a mother
at a child's grave

out of the grave
the sinking casket
pushes the light

a frosty night
gravestones rise
the width of a crack

hole in the silence
grave diggers alone
lower the coffin

between the graves
fences between friends
falling apart

visiting graves
the stone at dusk
warms

visiting graves
stone gardens lengthen
autumn's cool

his grave
filled with
his earth

his grave
covered with
my sky

rain
covering his grave
with low clouds

juicy blackberries
under the tangled vines
a forgotten grave

after visiting graves
a night of fever-chills
their nightmares

late afternoon
afraid to take nap
while visiting graves

last daughter
selling his house
setting a stone

gone but not forgotten
the white obelisk
in a patch of weeds

forgetting where
the family stone
sinks in

tombstones
marking those things
that don't die

deserted beach
alone with the waves
of septemberness

october beach
in all the footprints
the tread of shoes

autumn blooms
soft white cotton balls
a harvest field

brown harvest field
the balls of white cotton
polka dots

maple hills
stain the evening sky
autumn

barren hills
yet patches of purple
shadow

steps to the cabin
where you once lived
low in broken grass

selling the house
the scratch of a pen
in the family name

a chain of old keys
in a closed house
unlocking memories

the deed signed
taking down the birdhouse
dad built

bodies buried
and now the house belongs
to someone else

village lights
stretch down the road
draw us home

the afternoon sun
slants over a hand-made house
paints it september

selling the house
one last swim in the lake
the water's calm

flying home
at 35000 feet my folks
are not here either

nights the dripping roof
walks alone around the house
on one leg

hot springs
cool in the river
a jasper stone

desert storm
at the resort
hot springs

mineral baths
at night the many colors
in dreams

death valley
the underground river
a healing spring

moonlight
around the hot springs
dried salt

in healing waters
stars
old bodies

soul bathing
in hot springs
desert stars

ley lines
lines
drawn into the earth

earth lines
converging
flute tones

walking
the line within
the mountain

a moonlit meadow
all the nun are dressed up
as clowns

a moonlit meadow
chanting women give a voice
to dark ages

sea meadow ridge
the broken fence moves
when the cows come home

heather moors
rolled r's of wind
between the boulders

patchwork quilt
the rumpled beds
of heather

clouds of fog
hovering over stems
white heather

voices winding
through the heather moor
patterned paths

death valley
in a bluish haze
spectral mountains

mountain peaks
folding in prayer
for centuries

desert basin
mountains washed
down flat

salt patterns
mountain shapes
blue twilight

even mountains
gentle easing into earth
death valley

alkali clouds
over lava mountains
moonrise

wind mountain
inverted in the crater
invisible

movement of a bush
an animal the wind
of mountains moving

white clouds
bury the mountains
in deepest black

mountains between us
holding back the dawn
hours of my longing

mountain caves
wind carving empty
eye sockets

bodies
on indian ritual ground
wrecked cars

where indians died
the carcasses of ponies
of old cars

indian rocks
the night hawk's spirit
with a whir of wings

pages torn
from a sketchbook
far mountain ridges

autumn river
covering my feet wet
with golden leaves

quiet eddy pools
swirl at ankles in autumn
the ancient dead

in this light
flowing through the ages
desert river

fall
rocks tumble down
a dry river bed

white water
well-washed river
spirits

white ghost waves
rocky river ripples
roll upstream

wind rushing
into the valley
rockwater

the top of the rock
in the bottom of the pool
another stone

winding river road
the giant forest
approaches night

atop the mountain
mammoth rocks stare down
a smooth gray sea

bright sun
on the long waves of autumn
end of a day

night
the horizon sinks into the blue
water

stones
in the desert landscape
my bones

ascending alone
the threshold to heaven
barren rock

dry riverbed
in one of its rocks
dreamless sleep

monoliths
shaping the moonlight
granite

moon bright
where a rock fell away
shining

strangers
on the city side walks
one has his laugh

lamplight
straightening the street
of narrow houses

approaching the temple
grasses rub the body
of a snake

logging road
cut trees that never come
to the temple

before the temple
lizards turn
the grass brown

climbing temple hill
leg muscles tighten
in our throats

breathless
atop the steep hill
temple pagoda

breathless
climbing to the pagoda
wind

sea winds blow
from temple copper domes
holy sunshine

tibetan temple
the high-pitched hum
of an air plane

to our round eyes
temple splendors
a locked gate

temple secrets
held together
a chain link fence

temple fence
red and yellow prayer flags
poison ivy

holy smells
free in the air
between fences

temple dump
finding something
we could see

sunday
morning light from high rocks
temples

curving
the sky dome
temple roof

making temples
a full moon

timberline
granite rocks outgrowing
the trees

red rock waterfall
into emerald pools
cedar incense

water blackened rocks
falling with the waterfall
some of them

chipped rock
the shape of water
falling

white rim
on black rock

old forest
on bare paths
moths

night shadows
the valley floor rises
into the sky

tired
valley slopes
sag

the earth turns
in the valley
a river bends

death valley
saving light at dusk
salt

death valley
open blue skies
clouded

pale fog
yellow vineyards over
champagne cellars

wine-tasting
at the family-run vineyard
a cat too

cloud jeweled day
blackberry jam
on the windowsill

huckleberry jam
all the tiredness
up in jars

old maid's tea
pouring boiling water
on unopened flowers

soup bubbles
the past lives of vegetables
throbbing with heat

pepper shaker
in gathering darkness
a sharp sound

dinner over
the knife is clean and
the cup is empty

autumn rain
walking about in stocking feet
tasting the soup

old buttons
threaded on strings
lips closed

a blue coat
the length and width
of a shadow

his old jeans
pockets torn to flaps
in full possession

early autumn day
just right for throwing away
old tennis shoes

her ashes
forgetting
the bad times

morning trees
feeling the woodcutters
coming to work

chain saw stilled
the sound of the ocean
comes into view

old forest
cutting across the road
chain saws

clear cut
a sign on the stump
no trespassing

the mountain path
being drawn through the woods
a sound of saws

chopped kindling
the axe head warms
scarlet weather

silence
above a chain saw
a tree bends

going bald
the logger
the mountain

years going out
the rings of a tree
just cut down

puff of exhaust
our earth's lungs
hauled to the mill

farts
the logging truck
shifts down

sawdust
exciting the air
with sunlight

driftwood
women at the bar
bleached and scarred

singing low
sea-white fog disappears
into bar lights

life on the river
muddy water saloon
mountain still

drinking
in water the colors
of painted canyon

easing
into death
into earth

angel wings
the skeleton's feet
arranged in bones

edge of the cliff
the old couple discuss
going home

my parents
their breath gone
yet the wind blows

last sip
bitter taste of earth
in the water

death rattle
the bookmark in his bible
does not move

morning sun
the basket of fire-starting
twigs white with frost

sunset's glow
the heat in clay pots
being fired

gathering chestnuts
in the fall
a crack

returning year after year
to this one place
chestnuts and harvesters

chestnut burrs
open and defenseless
after harvest

a hunting dog
turning the stones
into quail

pulled taut
his long eyelashes
at the bow

a man with a gun
goes alone into the forest
of armless hunters

almost there
searching the dust
for moccasin tracks

no one home
the indian village
of house trailers

home from the dentist
he brushes his teeth
by a lace curtain

wearing the lace
behind thin clouds
the moon

a kerosene lamp
filling the pitcher
with sunflowers

long dead
he laughs and speaks jerkily
super eight home movie

watching the moon
grandma goes to sleep
with her glasses on

carrying umbrellas
strangers in the woods
hunt mushrooms

autumn sun
in a far cabin corner
a dulcimer

putting the dulcimer away
the last note lingers
drops to the floor

gusts of wind
raking leaves in a pile
without hands

autumn's dusk
the smell of burning leaves
brings tears to my eyes

rummage sale
at the lutheran church
a rosary

leaning scarecrow
real estate dealers also
are not upright

new owners
the familiar scarecrow
left his post

autumn evening
adding a long postscript
to mom's letter

dim stars
in the same sky
bats hiding

hidden in one palm
hundreds of bats
at the oasis

last light of day
into the clearing curves
the first bat

dipped in dark
bats streak
twilight skies

flying with him
red spots on the shoulders
of the black bird

an old yellow cat
paws tucked under her chest
waiting for a mouse-moon

the cicada's cry
leaves in the maples
brittle gold

cicadas
as if they'd won
a poetry contest

red-eyed cicada
wet from molting
softer than their cry

beached boat
each rib extended
by a cormorant

setting sun
blocked out by cows
following it home

cracked stones
a coyote's howl
widens the gap

joshua trees
ragged in night skies
a coyote's cry

light
in the coyote's eye
playing tricks

cold wind ruffles
breast feathers of a gray bird
rumors of war

lightning flash
into the sound of rain
a cricket shrills

nights
where you touched me
a cricket chirps

parental home
several crickets
keeping house

slower pulse
of an autumn evening
crickets

the candle dims
a creaking door cricket
changes form

a crow's wing tips
sweeps from the clouds
dark rain drops

crow wings
roughened by wind
ridged by a cliff

crows landing
autumn descends early
in a valley town

two crows
chasing each other
twilight

ebb tides
a flock of crows pulled
from sea caves

crow in rocks
a crack of black quartz
holds a nest

a light rain
not falling in places
the crow flies

death valley
the crow stands beside
his shadow

hard black white
sun on the crow's wing
before darkening trees

a crow cawing
so he too has swallowed
a fish bone

translating
japanese into english
crows

a calling of crows
crisscrossing the air
dark streaks flap

a bending of leaves
as a deer in passing
a sound

steepening the hillside
deer nibble wild flowers
above the autumn sea

deer hunters
soft brown eyes
reflecting blue

in velvet
the deer with his look
of questions

deer hunters
guns leaning against the sky
blue eyes

dead grass
deer bones
exposed

from the cabin
smells of supper cooking
a deer nibbles grass

frost and moonlight
separated
a dark deer shape

becoming
hillside bushes
deer

bronze bracken
the downed deer
not found

a boy watching
a deer dying
turns with a jerk

a stag's cry
a human voice
echoes in me

lovesick
one wild deer
in me

calling
the cry of deer
human desire

also in meditation
to the river bank deer
come down to drink

moonlight
making in her snowy belly
wild-doe milk

evening wind roars
still the nearby stag
hears my uneven breath

trudging up the path
where the hill is the steepest
a dragonfly

bridging worlds
the grass stalk bent
by the dragonfly

dragonflies
giving to their wings
afternoon skies

lantern light
voices in the grass
ring my shadow

at our farewell
insects chirp in the grasses
our lips dry

a jackal howls
a black mountain opens
moon light doors

sun in darkness
monarch butterflies
orange and black

flight of a bird
unmarked
a feather falls

high in autumn
a dark bird struggles
against the wind

pelicans gathered
ready to journey south
my bag is packed

migrating ducks
changing colors of the lake
to autumn

desert lake
roosting place
for water chickens

floating on the lake
the human voices
of ducks

dusk
horizon drawn by a line
of ducks

an owl hoots
the autumn wind blowing
through the o's

flying
in a dream an owl
leaves a cry

the moon rises
day fades into the sound
of owl feathers

dark trees
as a pheasant's call
night fall

liberated
the peasant hen
leaves the cock

picking grass seeds
how lightly quail go
over the land

the female quail
only there
when she moves

quail crossing
hill to hill
a shaft of sunlight

rolling
a flock of quail
on the run

eating the quail
that ate the peas
planted for winter

shadows moving
the forest floor turns
to quail

a mother quail
followed by her fifteen
separate shadows

stolen plums
rounding out the tummies
of raccoon

aware
raccoons on the porch
in my sleep

a dream of bears
raccoon on the porch
peek in the window

red upon red
dragonflies chasing
autumn

smoked salmon
a harvest moon rises
in autumn haze

smoked salmon
evening sky invites
the neighbors in

middle of the night
where scorpions creep
in cracks

knitting needles
the clack of scorpions
mating

a piece of night
breaks off to strike
a scorpion

lightning strikes
at the door a scorpion
tries to get in

unable to work
the scorpion and i stare
at each other

on his back
the scorpion's mate
dead

wood on wood
the dry scrap of scorpions
crawling between

the many feet
myriads of beach flies
a caressing wind

high tide
backs against the cliff
shadflies

newborn
flies on the beach
dark damp sand

following
a vein of quartz the eye
of a spirit hawk

up the tree
the squirrel stops at the sign
vote for supervisor

a gray squirrel
tire tracks
in his wet fur

termite tunnel
curved by a cypress
long in the wind

rising from roots
winged termites
rusty as redwoods

wild turkey's cry
in the cabin at dusk
a door closes

undulating
backs of wild turkeys
blown sea oats

vulture feather
white downy fluff
at the shaft

nude sun worshipper
the vultures circle
the old woman

a band of sunlight
on the vulture's wing
a feather missing

tangled branches
vulture shadows
on the darkening

last light
out of the cove
a dark bird

oak grove picnic
slow sound of our chewing
acorns falling

jokes in an oak grove
as acorns fall down
over our laughing

dad on high
dropping from his trees
apples for lunch

southern sunset
filling the apple bin
a deeper red

applesauce
the cinnamon glow
of a kerosene lamp

windfall apples
palaces for worms
american pie

dad gone two years
still he cares
with apples pears

baskets in a row
overflowing with apples
on one a sweater

straight falling rain
tiny lakes upon the tree
stem hollows of apples

broken by the storm
the asters' fragrance rises
out of damp earth

amid bare bushes
the flash of a woman's flanks
squatting to pee

darkness
winding the river road
bare trees

roots in the sky
the bare tree turns
an upside down day

abandoned orchard
bare branches
full of apples

hidden all summer
among the oak branches
my neighbor's house

autumn storm
the neighbor closer
by a bare tree

from the wind
the flute lesson
of a bare tree

a frosty night
in all the trees
such a letting go

autumn
the bloodless wounds
of farewell and leaves

touching a tree
in palm the sound
of its bark

picking berries
the brown bear
of a neighbor

autumn sun
lying in brown bracken
both of us

mountain spring
a fall of fern
in autumn

leaving new friends
to return home among
dried sword ferns

higher education
from the school yard
these two buckeyes

an old friend
chinquapin burrs open
on smooth fruits

cactus patch
enlightenment comes with
getting the point

at the point
of enlightenment
holy cross cholla

chestnuts we gathered
as they warm the memories
of italian sunshine

meeting an old friend
chestnut burrs pressed
in our folded hands

falling down
the mums not picked
because you are gone

autumn rain
above the dialysis machine
a withered mum

frost-tipped mums
gathered in withered arms
with black sleeves

all in black
she stoops to save
frost-tipped mums

chrysanthemums
with them in the room
i cannot close my eyes

fall fashions
the tweedy patterns
in cotton fields

canyon crevice
out of red rock water flows
into a golden tree

cottonwood
in the leafless limbs
starlings

autumn evenings
cottonwood trees
seem too cool

cottonwood trees
the dry sound of rain
along the river

at the oasis
wearing the coolness
of willow and cottonwood

late rains
high in a river tree
autumn gold leaves

river of gold
sunning with cottonwoods
virgin river

harvest moon
a bulging corn crib
releases it

small weeds
finding shadows
for the night

autumn
down the length
of tall grass

dried weeds
a nameless spider
loses his shadow

wild squaw grass
wind twining the slenderness
with shafts of sunlight

withered grass
a crow stretches his eye
over hanging heads

ridge top
burnished grasses
the monk's pate

dear mom
her letter on a driftwood stick
washed out to sea

the way! the ocean
arranges driftwood logs
on a deserted beach

driftwood
bright with burning
stars

sunday visitors
admiring sculptured driftwood
in the town square

high tide
the secret script of driftwood
writing itself

driftwood
silver sea mists
petrified

on the island
no one goes to
driftwood

falling
down all sides of the mountain
leaves

nude in the river
a dirty old leaf
touches my thigh

very drunk
bright leaves
fall into a heap

a gust of wind
tossed back into the sky
fallen leaves

in frozen mud
the imprint of a long leaf
lying somewhere else

on the ground
leaves from one tall tree
three inches deep

a swimming hole
filled with the cold
of fallen leaves

drawing boats
on each leaf
ribs in water

sound
from the lizard's voiceless throat
dry leaves

among fallen leaves
a voice from the neighbor's yard
scraping cement

autumn
mountain climbers
one leaf falls

cloves of garlic
arguing voices
braided together

old-timers
finding golden autumn
most lovely

blown leaves
turning the sunlight
from green to gold

riversong
wind blown from autumn trees
a stream of gold

autumn leaves
along with with sunset
a blaze of glory

weeping rock
in autumn dried leaves
gold

low autumn sun
rolling over red rocks
golden trees

late rains
high in a river tree
autumn gold leaves

nearness of hills
undulating in the garden
tufts of heather

patchwork quilt
the rumpled beds
of heather

picking huckleberries
afterwards the lessons
in braille

huckleberries
in her smile
purple teeth

huckleberries
in redwood shadows
round and tart

mountain evening
in a huckleberry sky
the smell of pie

into autumn trees
a rain-wet road winds
sky colors

autumn hills
a mountain of leaves
down from maples

vermont trip
maples color the back roads
of california

maples
because they are admired most
when their leaves are old

autumn colors
in a redwood grove
one maple afire

stone lantern
dark before the flaming
maple

looking closely
under the mushroom
a desert landscape

woman in the woods
touching mushrooms
touching the base

teary halos
round the moon
onion rings

cutting an onion
all the halos
fall in the soup

sun from the sea
swept up the hills
with pampas grass

pampas grass plumes
the color calls from the west
autumn winds

ribbons of moonlight
glowing out of the earth
pampas grass

salt in a cellar
at seven the mirror frame
a mottled pear

pears
coloring themselves
the days of summer

persimmons
their roundness softens
rice stubble

red-breasted birds
among ripe persimmons
hiding from the cold

fallen plums
at the end of the dog's nose
cold and wet

under dark earth
dusty white potatoes
the moon rises

grins
harvested
pumpkins

a redwood falls
the air of heaven
laid low

giant forest
approaching night
in the redwoods

without a step
giant redwoods going
up the mountain

redwood roots
the base thickens
enters the earth

redwoods
her inheritance
with wind in it

running up and down
the tallest redwood
only my eye

volcanic ash
three and a half million years old
saving the redwoods

redwoods cathedral
darkening the apse
a circle of trees

in a tower
redwoods still growing
shelter

among these redwoods
growing old seems
rather honorable

evening stretches
over desert gold
purple sage

cathedral canyon
under christ's picture
wild sage

fire red
without its flower
the smoke tree

smoke trees
rising to sound
in high caves

braided rice straw
i find a photo
of your lover

in back of the school
yellow leaves of sycamore
an acid burn

tar weeds
along the road
covered with it

alone
picking green tomatoes
before the frost

sea oats
bent by the north wind
barely ripens

strange land
hanging in mid-air i am
as leaves in the larch

leaves caught
in cages of limbs
escape

bent grass
the shape of the apple tree
in brown leaves

before falling
dusty yellow leaves
freshened by rain

leaves fall
the air filled
with church bells

fruitless vines
going out of their way to repair
the broken wicker chair

driftwood
taking root in the river
vines

autumn sun
under willows
a yellow leaf

still standing
where others lived
abandoned cabin

dusting the dresser
a gown which shared
our passion

death
the star sailor
home again

as dreams
wood in an iron stove
falls into ash

bubbles and branches
ice moving
the i ching hexagram

tree roots
bones of the dead
leaving earth

a carved name
smelling of bone marrow
round and white

last days
as thin as her skin
loose on bones

people who die
when the sea is full
a law of foam

silence
between old folks
no longer breathing

tracing the blue
veins on her breast
winter

baby's ancient face
wrinkled and sexless
grandparents

touchstone
the body arching the abyss
death

antique
mirroring on tv
gone with the wind

bored by winter
wild surf waters knot
sea grass

bored with winter
a beach walk finds
abandoned toys

another rainy day
cleaning out of the toaster
crumbs

silence
around the old couple
all their repeated words

silence
faces at the party
in a mirror

after hours of conflict
white waves no longer mount
the black rock

blank book
eyes filled with
waves and wind

cold the room
when the last of the ink
has been written

without a lamp
the moonlight turns
my hair white

black ink
the many poems dye
my hair white

spilled wine
finger prints on the glass
shaking

young at heart
still the roses fade
on her nightie

a haircut
less white
on this old woman

winter road
a sharp turn
to the nursing home

gaining weight
the world thicker
with snow

winter leaving
another blue vein
on her leg

first snow
i'm not one year older
anymore

gazing at her photograph
the glass reflects
an older face

painted silver
her wrinkles mar
the smooth glass

fifty years
not remembering which
toothbrush is his

aging beauty
truth lies on the mirror
reversed

winter so cold
the sun leaves earlier
each day

midnight room
rays of candlelight
star-cold

night cold
surf's surge and boom
in the bathtub

lying in bed
cold beside my sleep
wide awake

a new winter friend
up the year's steep sloping
our flow of words

your poem
the brief language
of footsteps

bird song
under winter quilts
bodies touching

together
your tip glows
as incense burns

seaweed tied in knots
ashore in winter storm
we stick together

necking
the never-ending story
movie forgotten

telephone call
your smile in a space
you've never gone

curved ink
the warmth of your hand
in the letters

charmed
a sunny day in winter
a new you

ice melting
her hand touches
his

a glow
the whole candle
a flame

angels
dreams on your face
my eyes

appearing
me in your dream
you in my

uplifting
light hearts
magic

this vow
written so deep
in dreams

their eyes
as a priest raises the wine
blood rushes to her cheeks

evening alone
only pine mountain
my guest

northeaster storm
yet feelings of longing
dare the cross winds

quilt patterns
the full moon's path
of my desire

deep in winter
no one comes to say
look it's snowing

desert
silence between us
cold at night

waiting for you
the dull swish
of my raincoat

pines
bowed with snow
my longing

sleeping
your image in dreams
awakens

in my dream
you touch me
awake

it's black
the road that takes
you from me

waiting for guests
the corner of the rug
keeps turning up

something's coming
in winter's high-water marks
a dry rustle

earth frozen dry
leaves behind my wide cape
thus i search for you

wet chalk
it's been such a long time
since you've written

grinding more ink
the only thought that comes
tender as the rain

the chalk of her pelvis
beacons for a child's soul
now draws a line

distant daughter
hearing her coins drop
into a telephone

driftwood hermitage
cold and loneliness
take up the pen

pages filled
yet the stamp carries away
unspoken words

sleeping alone
the cold side
of the bed

wild surf
shaking the sunny beach
our desire for spring

salt crusts
thin skin on a blown beach
this itching

dreams under the tent
of the burpee seed catalog
winter gardens

eaves dripping
the candle flame
flickers

in the back of my brain
a photo of your eyes
watching my day

blue on the postcard
how far from the sea
we both are

winter days
a heart runs without panting
to the beach

nothing in nature
truly black
my moods

breathing
underlining sentences
in a book

unknown keys in a box
she takes a vow
- no more love affairs

after the argument
the sound of your eyelashes
brushing the pillow

winter cold
the sound of ocean waves
between us in bed

tears not shed
at your leaving
a sinus drip

silence
between your words
anger

silence
after something falls
a coming apart

silence
between words
stories

silence
before the answer
truth

a lover's quarrel
the seamstress tries
to patch things up

asleep
surrounded by things
that don't

hard to believe
the someone touching the roof
is only rain

panic
as rain presses
the window's dark sound

sun on a pine branch
laughing shadow image
a jackeral's face

ghost stories
beyond the fire circle
old new noises

bear stories
interrupted by the clatter
of a garbage can

precipice
the wind blows stronger
my fear of falling

awakened
by the hours of night
an owl's dream

dreams
turning on the light
staying in the dark

nervous
the whole house shakes
in the wind

three minutes
from here to eternity
a phone call

flickering candle
i'm not the only one
who is scared

moving eyes
objects reproduced
a silence of mirrors

fog fear
things so familiar
they have no shadow

from where come ideas
now when frogs are still
as cold stars

last light
glasses comes alive
to watch out the night

at the airport
in the town where i was born
sinking into the mud

by a dormant tree
someone is singing
as the scythe rusts

grief
hours alone lift our feet
from the knowing

alive
the dead go walking
in my feet

mind wandering
dragging a heart-spun net
in heavy seas

a branch
fallen to the roof
downward and sloping

dead
and this morning
he'll never see

sea spray climbs sheer cliff
on the beach without legs
a man in a wheelchair

for her window
persian patterns of a rug
wheelchair spokes

winter moon
alone it journeys northward
brightens my doorstep

her face
a fold in fabric
smiles

palest butterflies
trapped in paper cages
letters in winter

she saw reflected
in the dampness of his eyes
herself alone

gray painted
the level landscape
life as a photo

a white room
its walls drawing in
the energy patterns

only the candle
reads my poems
wavers in the wind

in my chair
listening to my music
a stranger

silence so profound
it takes the shape
of your inner ear

isolated farms
the white sky of snowdrifts
outlining the cold

fog
closing the brushwood gate
silences ocean waves

leaving a book
blind hands touch
her own smile

window
a filter of snow
winter blind

stairs
where no one speaks
or rises

alone again
with the wind in the pines
somewhere else

gone
yet the space you left
shines with light

alone
building a fire
for company

alone
in the fire
voices

a strange land
saying i love you
again

the wind dies
the sound in one's own ears
empty

enjoying life
for all the dead
the yet unborn

his face aglow
the deaf child
making signs

come see the sunset?
the old woman too busy
for endings

touching me
during the ballet
his left hand

winter madness
parachuting to earth
pale blue creatures dangle

written in a dream
all three lives
now forgotten

boxlike silence
after the grandparents leave
empty rooms

a chalk drawing
a piece of amber
very near pain

in my ear
hurtful blood sounds
of the sea

your words
the wind rubs the lake
the wrong way

another tranquillizer
the cat begins to purr
more r's in the room

winter weaves
a pile of pillows
on a hard chair

comforter
buttoned to the bed
a curled-up cat

curving waves
sleep carries away
candlelight

packing
arms of the flannel shirt
holding on to peace

smoothed by seas
a nearly round rock
points homeward

home again
raking in the zen garden
the oldest pattern

driftwood hermitage
a well-chewed stick
writes in the sand

too poor
for a luxury house
walking a deserted beach

his crooked face
peering into a puddle
for a dropped penny

silence
marked down half-price
the broken squeak toy

cloud-covered
a departed soul
sky-blue

wind still
grandma's afternoon nap
lasts forever

the string cut
in death feet go awry
walking labyrinths

no!
the grave is not the end
we remember too much

twilight
finding in an old album
dad is still young

opening her closet
secrets alive in the colors
she has worn

snow
pictures of other lands
other lovers

winter colors
passing in sleep
dream zones

measuring
the box once again
inside

underground
the celtic cauldron
a ringing bell

winter dreams
lingering on long arms
summer warmed

i touch myself
with lacquered nails
as you once did

memories
stored in our muscles
an iron will

without a shadow
on bright days
the hand i know

mailbox
a frozen puddle overflows
a rejection slip

bedtime story
i love you he said
leaving to meet a lover

ebb tide
anger and rejection
sucked out to sea

filled by the sea
the stony places
of hurting

all my anger
singing with the vacuum
cleaner

rows of holes
edging the stamp
of your last letter

after our words
on the lace tablecloth
cut flowers

data processing
her letters from new york
in winter

gutted candle
if only i too
could sleep

sea wind
searching me for something
someone i once was

desiring freedom
her photos no longer
capture views

misty red daybreak
newly lit fires in the kitchen
wish to be on a train

sweet cold
incense in a winter room
alone

treasure
in a seashell serene colors
a day alone

a roof of rain
the sound inside
solitude

silence
after you've gone
the widening world

silence
when all alone
a tunnel

a corner
the shape of solitude
chair and book

deaf child
patterns of a persian rug
echoing

winter
the hours melting
into snowflakes

still awake
on top of the comforter
one feather

long damp beach
winter solstice
at ebb tide

walking in a fog
a solitary person attended
by angels

the shape of wind
writing in dunes
loneliness

alone in the house
the flavor of peppermint
cold on the tongue

a journey begins
the way familiar
to the door

frozen to his feet
the length of a shadow
wanting to sleep

alone in the room
the gaudy television
and me smiling

empty coffee cup
the face looking at me
gone

origami
she explained folding
up the dollar bills

homeless man
tied to his sleeping bag
shoes going nowhere

art store sale
the poet buys erasers
at a discount

an old maid
her favorite dancing dress
yellows the attic

warm-breath wind
words are helpless
on parted lips

since birth unemployed
the rich man
and his navel

darkness welling up
cold waters of the sea
a sob

songs of sorrow
the harp string breaks
the fall of tears

laughter
after the argument
sounds like sobs

a blue wave
on the crest
an eyelid closed

cloves and nutmeg
grandma separated yolks
with one hand

first frost
cutting out cookies
with sugared tops

winter air
warmed in the kitchen
toasted bagels

winter dawn
all the bright stars
in cookie jars

mendocino hills
green for christmas
new lambs

mendocino christmas
on spring-green meadows
red jersey cows

deserted beach
couple in driftwood den
trim a flotsam tree

mendocino christmas
among snowy egrets
flakes of pussy willows

christmas carols
in la the air conditioner
hums along

christmas eve
star of the west
point arena lighthouse

sea side christmas
shore pines bright with mist
at the lighthouse

a solstice moon
13 women around a drum
the old circles us

christmas bazaar
the carefully tied bow
crooked

christmas bells
pouring excitement
into the air

in the old folks' home
practicing christmas carols
children again

howling sea winds
christmas carols
sung by the local choir

christmas
a sleigh draws homeward
all my thoughts

coming ashore
on christmas day
pure white waves

christmas
in the driest places
desert holly

christmas day
a waiting at the roots
of pine trees

christmas dinner
still warm
two crows by roadkill

covered with ice
the picnic table
on christmas day

christmas eve
a life time of habits
not sleeping

christmas eve
out of the sea storm
a lighthouse

christmas eve
sea rocks unmoved
by the storm

christmas eve
out of the dark
hail

christmas eve
hail
peace on earth

christmas eve
the batteries left on
all night

christmas eve
only star
a foghorn

holiday ridge
points of candlelight and
stars

christmas lights
shining in the sun
their unbelief

christmas lights
in the thick pine forest
a rising moon

christmas play
afterwards all the stars
on the school bus

christmas gifts
what to buy
for someone dying

cash crop
jesuit priests peddle
christmas trees

christmas tree out
cleaning the room
for spring

in the corner
where the christmas tree gloried
crooked chair shadows

christmas day
near-by a squirrel poses
on a greeting card

snow falling
the long awaited letter
on its way

letters written
with a thick nubbed pen
storm trees

christmas ornaments
bought that year
we didn't come home

christmas ornaments
last year's dust
wrapped in tissue

unwrapping
valentine gifts
naked

brand new
valentine's gift
herpes

married in the cold month
sea foam freezes
on the rocks

my white christmas
only under the branches
of the snowberry bush

winter solstice
the white night alone
with rolling surf

winter solstice
the sun in the south
with old folks

south sun
december's horizon
rolled in fog

winter solstice
the sun at its own
birthday party

for winter solstice
bumpy as an orange
moonset

winter solstice
warmth of friends
return the sun

winter solstice
greeting like souls
the sun returns

winter solstice
a white eve alone
with a wild surf

heavy clouds
winter solstice brightens
lightning

after the solstice
cleaning the house
trimming wicks

winter solstice
finding a new point
for acupressure

winter solstice
so low in the trees its return
just stays

christmas gifts
wrapped in white tissue
mist-covered mountains

wrapping gifts
a whale swims by
covered with barnacles

frost sharp air
cut into pieces by sunshine
sparkling on snow

winter air
thick as the branches
bare

winter begins
leaving for me alone
autumn

giving away
autumn kittens
winter begins

gathering clouds
heavy and dark with holding
unfallen flakes

low clouds
pressing out of the sea
huge waves

purple lava peaks
rain clouds hovering over
desert sunset

purple peaks
with fire-rimmed steam
sunset clouds

winter clouds
summer dreams
turning to ice

night light
thin cloud cover guides me
across the room

dark on the sea
a rain cloud brushes
the tops of waves

cloud dark
joined to sea dark
by falling rain

roaring down the beach
at the height of winter waves
mist clouds

a curtain pulled back
by a south wind
cold

smooth snow
deeper than garden stones
the cold

beach cold
twisting driftwood
into a windbreak

beach cold
freezing a driftwood
windbreak

winter waves
rolling into sun-warmed sand
driftwood

waves
rolling into frosted sand
winter

winter cold
finding on the beach
an open knife

empty hands
our holes
in the cosmos

bell-tone circles
as path to meditation
across galaxies

winter dawn
sounds of blowing snow
sleeping birds

sea dawn
the journey of snowflakes
to a parking lot

clouds resting
on top of snowdrifts
winter dawn

daybreak
glass shatters
the dream

just at daybreak
a drift of snow balanced
on each branch

winter dawn comes
the sound of blowing snow
sleeping birds

falling out
at the crack of dawn
snowflakes

between mountains
and heavy snow clouds
daybreak

frozen sun
dawn's clouds
faint with pink

the skin of our teeth
as thick as a life
a winter day

daybreak
light drifting down
in snowflakes

snow by candlelight
brightens the turn
to shorter days

for tall folks
the hours of light
shortened

slow rains
as if leaves were falling
at winter's end

first light
nudging frozen clouds
snow flakes

star gazing
all the familiar things
in morning's light

milky dawn
the world without color
takes form

spots of blue
varying the light to fit
tracks in the snow

morning light
a couple on the cliff
as spirits of a new day

just now
the moon set
and you sleep

timeless
in the fog
someone walking

foggy night
farmlights of a lonely coast
separate

wrapped in fog
colors of the coast
quiet

fog
edge of the cliff
edge of the world

ocean fog
in the broken sign
open

fog
the days go by
without hours

evening fog
in town with dampened
spirits

mist
broken from night waves
sleep

asleep
fog extends
the morning

foggy morning
coming in the door
weak sunlight

thick swirling fog
not seeing anything
just a wing shape

new flannel gown
wrapped for the night
in thick sea fog

fog
river mouth
bridged

worldly view
obscured by sea fog
angel wings

fingers
into valleys
sea fog

warming
thick fog
a fire

out of fog
fog colors
in waves

into the cove
fog pours
more secrets

cutting out the world
sounds of the sea
fog

erasing the land
the ocean sends a blanket
of fog

neighbors
leaving as
fog

frost
dropping a basket
with 12 eggs

lace edges
the fallen leaf
white with frost

granite patterns
fallen to leaves
frosted rust

flowers blooming
on dry sand and pond
frost

water over ice
floating among clotted leaves
a face expiring

surf sounds
covering the winter porch
a shell of ice

clouds
still in the mountain brook
ice

before they melt
hailstones hiding themselves
in the gravel path

spindrift
falling on the hills
hail

veiled moon
fragments loosen
hail

silence
after the hailstorm
cold

jingling coins
deep in his pocket
the moon slides behind clouds

cold
the winter moon with you
at the window

full-moon sky
cold high winds blow
from a bright hole

waning moon watches
a pie put out to cool
eaten away

dark night winds
blowing over the seas
the moon sinks in

the full moon
slips into its silver path
sea sleep

melting into the sea
the full moon
leaves a candle bright

plunging right in
the moon and i
cold night seas

time
on a moonless night
a dog barking

released
from snow-capped peaks
a full moon

cold winds
rounding snow-capped peaks
a full moon

from the full moon
cold summit winds
snow-clad

touching eyes
the whiteness of snow
a full moon

winter moon
directing the winds
around corners

winter's new moon
the cutting cold
shines tonight

high on a cliff
the quarter moon finds
dark houses

wolf moon
slipping into northern pines
winter

winter moonlight
the crystal prism turns
with the tides

surf and sea
white with the sound
of moonlight

mornings
the winter moon leaves
a frosted path

cold night
i feed brownies
to aching bones

knocking
cold comes in unasked
the night house

winter nights
enough warmth
to answer letters

night
breaking waves
rocks

silence
in a dark night
an ill-made shape

night the animal
that keeps death in a little space
prowls to the left

night
overtaking the blackness
of molten rock

longest night
full moon whitens
pure snow

northern lights
a white robed choir sings
to radio static

rattle of rain
across the valley
into my hand

downpour
a basket on the porch
fills with rain

raindrops
inside
heartbeats

after dinner
so full of soup
it begins to rain

to the rocks
the sky falling free
a bluish glow

pale skies
winter comes from afar
a white foam wave

blind smoke
touching the sky
with one finger

wood smoke
pressed to the porch
by low clouds

life
of a snowflake
falling

mono lake
on salt-crystal pillars
snowflakes

silence
snowing
light

satisfied
with toast and cocoa
it stops snowing

porch light
brilliant with the points
of falling snow

night light
snow falls
on the porch

rain
silent
snow

the clock ticks
back and forth
snowfall

first snow
deep as a fallen leaf
upright

mountain deep
a sky covering with snow
our way home

blue cold snow
warmed by fallen leaves
russet brown

ticking
each hour
snow deepens

early snow
even in the hole is white
overturned outhouse

the world wobbles
the weight of snow
drifting

no trespassing
yet thru the split rail fence
snow goes

to touch stars
her outstretched hand
fills with snowflakes

snowdrifts
flinging moth wings
across the land

melting snow
your tracks leaving
a dampness

melting snow
the white nets hold down
springing grasses

it melts
last light of afternoon
rest of the snow

cap of snow
on the sun-warmed rock
shrinking to fit

new-fallen snow
scraped by wing tips
leaving the earth

new-fallen snow
screams of children
biting cold

snow predicted
a jar of old buttons
in the top drawer

giant snowflakes
bring to the window
adult faces

crystals
filling the night window
with stars

glistening cold
the stars bend down
a few flakes

snow taste
the cold fire
of frozen stars

high winds
stars moved about
by swaying tress

cold stars
dropping into the ocean
snowflakes

winter stars
pea soup doesn't taste
without salt

the first stars
a farmhouse
and a buoy

before one star
beams from the lighthouse
search the sky

into the sky
notes from the harp
light stars

earth lines
starpaths light
the fluid landscape

in our blood
bright crystals
star journeys

waves
in and out of the sea
stars

curving the sky
storm clouds arch
into the bay

the winter tempest
visiting the neighbors
how still it is

winter storms
passing the rain rattle
drums on the roof

sea storm
blue black clouds sink
salt-water air

after the snowstorm
new paths to old places
the skies clear

fire on water
reflecting the sun
after a storm

between winter storms
a fisherman come to bring
poems and primroses

after the snowstorm
only wood smoke drifts
into the clearing

snow storm
brings white skies
down to earth

this blizzard
blowing about
one small candle

snow storm
children hanging in a tree
paper flowers

storm winds
in all things that don't die
this quivering

winter storm
tearing the waves white
low-scudding clouds

storm winds
breeze through a cracked window
our nightly breath

storm waves
winter tides wave
to mountain tops

storm clouds
forcing the sun to set
far out to sea

night storm
at sea dark things
move closer

winter storms
wrapping around the house
the ocean's roar

storm sails
cloud evening skies
eyes

winter sun
coming in late
for breakfast

low winter sun
covered with one wave
leaping on the beach

low winter sun
walking the length
of the rock's shadow

mid-winter's day
the sun and moon
combine warmth

mid-winter's sun
breaking the ice
in a rain barrel

sunset
stumbling over rocks
shadows

sunset
all the shadows
home

sunset
leaving to the wind
bare rocks

sunsets
blue clouds as land
into pink seas

sunset
all the shadows
going home

night's warmth
sucked into the sea
a sinking sun

ocean sunset
staying by the window
'till the color sinks

winter twilight
gathers in her lap
white folded hands

blue desert wind
pushes the hills' shadow
the long walk home

ocean
twilight as final
as the last one

alkali flats
in the twilight of evening
snow white

the rain-filled wind
blowing away the word
a damp newspaper

wind
being massaged
by wind chimes

from far at sea
waves bring without wind
that sound

winter wind
a red flag waves
to the whiteness

rock music
the beach house shaken
by howling winds

wind
finding dark places in cliffs
for the night

sea winds
not believing in
the silence

wind
from the mouth of something
dark

a blanket of wind
wrapping around the house
ocean cold

sea foam
pulling storm winds
across the beach

night winds
touching crested waves
with frost

wind tears
smoke from the chimney
snow flakes

aeolian harps
rigged for sailing
snowfields

tundra wind
in an ancient poet's ears
followers' footprints

snow
lighting the way
of the wind

across the sea
wind blows to me
stranger's snow

riding white roads
before dawn without a steed
winds of winter

crossing the bay
from island to island
winter winds

unseen wind
water touching water
with its roar

wind
tangling bare air
black trees

homeward
wind pushes us across
evening shadows

winter wind
the smell of french fries
and cold grease

circus time over
now it begins to be
winter

leaves gold shine
holding bright
the wall of winter

scrape of a spoon
in the empty bowl
end of winter

stony sand
coming and going
winter waves

a crust of snow
seaweed flung high
by the night tide

storm-tossed waves
edged with foam
breaking sand

people who die
when the sea is full
a row of foam

beach pebble
round with its years
in the making

waves
break and foam
yet stars

in and out
of the driftwood lair
gull tracks

beach-blown
rainbows in sea foam
sand crystals

a winter's day
suddenly the sun
at a beach picnic

beach laid dark
by low tide now covered
with night waters

high on the hill
the earth smiles
a bay beach

february sun
lying on the nude beach
fully clothed

a stick
poking holes in sand
the beach i ching

the swish of surf
falling snowflakes
have a sound

winter beach
in thin white clouds
thoughts of snow

deep in winter
the babbling brook
white as stone

bubbles in ice
holding till spring
the voice of the brook

the mountain brook
still with listening
winter winds

winter warm
red canyon walls hold
the low sun

night mirror
the mouth of a cave
open  pale

frozen cliffs
swept by lighthouse beams
soft in the dark

giant waves
sea cliff rocks
summer sea secure

high tossed mists
warmed in morning sun
above winter cliffs

after the storm
sandstone cliffs relax pebbles
into the beach

high tide
brings storm waves
to cliff dwellers

sea spray
the cliff laced
by crystal

north wind
reducing the cliffs
by a splashed wave

night wheels
the rolling surf
crashes on cliffs

hill dwellers
winters stormy seas
carving the coast

crater rim
white with snow
our lips cold

crystal veins
in the darkest rock
stars

rocks
crystallize
sand

living rock
in veins of crystal
waterfalls

winter desert
forgotten the heat
of cinder paths

desert vista
in silence between us
the little heat

windows
in the cinder rocks
wind ohs

the cutting cold
pulled up on a dike
a silver canoe

winter leaves
in the ditch a glove
without a hand

wind
song that curves
dunes

a field of snow
fenced in by fields
of snow

wind-filled snow
now brushing the eaves
now sweeping fields

snowy fields
in a row of winter trees
veins of leaves

the winter moon
diminishing into snowflakes
open fields

fields of bones
beyond the cemetery
white with snow

dark fences
encircling the snowy field
eyelashes blink

snow and moonlight
fill the open field
sky high

snow fields
half-melted
a quarter moon

her long thumbnail
fallow fields lie empty
with snow

stitching together
now-covered fields
blackbird wings

warming
the corner of winter's field
an unattended fire

nuns
all old women who work
fenced in fields

a whiteness
in and out of the woods
as flakes

frost
on the granite
gravel

light spilling
into a waterfall
frost

tiny gardens
huddle together in winter
on the windowsills

glacier gorge
after the snowstorm
empty with light

nap time
warm on a granite wall
glacier marks

glacier
rounding rocks
now a woman

under low clouds
evening sky glacier
cools the wind

a journey ends
where the glacier melted
a field of stones

granite
without shadow edges
ice on black water

clouds
leaving their shapes
in hills

winter rain
brushing wild hills
a faint green

low winter light
hoarded in red hills
at sunset

crystal waters
warmed with the scent
of earth

ancient earth
tiredness of my old body
in hot springs

winter stars
warmed in mineral baths
foggy

dreams
from hot mineral baths
a bright lava flow

winter night
joining us in the bath
foggy stars

silence
ice all by itself
squeaks

crystals
designed in dark cold time
ice cubes

out of a rock
water flows with history
rimmed with frost

icicles hang
yet above my face
her naked breasts

windless days
surrounding the islands
in deep sleep

winter morning surf
brings to cold sand
a ruddy glow

tapered
the knife lies in the river
an island untouched

red and black
jasper and obsidian
from a volcano

jasper
volcanic gift of healing
from earth fires

fire spirits
gift
jasper nuggets

a glare of ice
to walk without a path
the frozen lake

snowstorm
dropping white skies
into a lake

the lake thawing
an image of a woman
awaking

tufa towers
reflecting in the lake
volcanoes

sunrise
burning in the salt sea
a pillar of light

fire spirits
underwater architecture
comes to light

winter-bound peaks
the snow not melted
by our gazing

snow-capped peaks
sun setting fires
with fog-smoke

out of snow
sun sets mountain peaks
a fire

snow-covered
sweet water mountains
rising upward

mountains
folding in the sky
blue snow shadows

north wind
guardian of the narrows
bares the trees

without a guardrail
the tumble-down place
where cars go over

faults
folding mountains
unfolding history

nothing to wear
just clouds
covering mountains

as in the sky
mountain snowfields
trackless

mountain cabin
a wedge of winter sunlight
pushes in the doorway

closing the mind
the sameness of gates
mountain passes

snow blowing
far from the ocean an aching ear
stuffed with cotton

arctic snowfields blow
across sky-blue waters
white caps

where the sun sank
a ship sails cool
on western waters

winter sun
waving the ocean's brightness
a blue-white flag

winter white
on the ocean's block of blue
melting crust of foam

storm-washed sea
each flat wave
a dirty gray

pounding the beach
with storm wild waves
the foghorn

storm waves
falling from angel shoulders
sea spray

all night
the sound of waves
purple silk

cold winter ocean
warms spindrift
in the sun

winter ocean tossing
spindrift over the cliff
into morning sun

curving waves
sleep carries us away
all night

wave songs
pound upon eyelids
sleep

dark blue lines
in a salt sea
dreams

sea ironed black
stars hang at the edge
of winter

ocean waves
and things that sleep
so words can hold them still

kneading dough
silent in the window
wild surf rolls

sea winds
a rush and noise
learned from water

silence
between crashing waves
white foam

a flow of snow
returning the wave
foaming surf

winter waves
playing tag
with old folks

winter waves
crowning plumes
of white spray

a sunny corner
all the winter winds
in white waves

seaside town
emptied at night
by a roaring tide

midnight air
pounded seas
a throbbing

tearing night
wild surf rolls in
morning light

wild surf
on glistening wings
harp rhythms

wild surf
sea and earth
singing air

snowfields
whiteness at high tide
the surf

snowy hill
stretches the unbroken field
curving it just a bit

wild seas
footprints fill
with foam

listening to sea waves
the cup of tea also
tastes cold

surface tension
the smooth ocean
a sacred mirror

snow-covered peaks
covered with blackness
obsidian fields

a peninsula
the gulls carry their name
from sea to sea

land's end
pushing into the sea
white water

the old pond
how snugly it fits
new ice

winter millpond
the moon cuts wavelets
in silver slivers

in time
oars dipping
into winter

upstream
the solstice moon has frozen
the river

sun shine
in a drop of melting snow
the river black

rocks frozen in snow
a lonely woman stares
at the river's cold

snow-capped rocks
above the river's current
nimbus

surf tongue
a whispering roar
in the river's mouth

each day anew
river's mouth finds
the sea

river mouth
rushing to the sea
curves a smile

suspension bridge
so narrow my shadow
waits on shore

his days measured
a river flowing
across the sky

mouth open
dangerous as the river ends
in ocean waves

late leaves
skidding over frozen snow
yesterday's news

bright earth
filling to the ceiling
snow-cold

cushions
on summer chairs
snow

bright aura
everything covered
with snow

mountain air
crystallized by snow
and granite

snow-capped peaks
on the desert floor white clouds
of alkali dust

windowsill
piled with snow
far ridges

almost a mountain
the hills grow up
with snowdrifts

dark place in snow
the bag of coal
now white itself

cloud shadows
the sky's footprints
on mountain snow

cold night
stacks on the woodpile
a cover of snow

snowbound
the lake also
disappeared

snowbound
fire spirits
in a salt lake

snowbound
all the colors
quiet

heart of an agate
slivered with polishing
turns to the sun

a quartz crystal
light years ago
keeping time

facing the sea
weathered rocks of age
wrinkled and gray

painted stones
tree shadows
not moving

bubbling out of the sea
rock burned black
a million years ago

soft round mounting
a rock the sea leaves
it jagged

curved straight
a sea rock spreads
white spray wing

silence of stones
songs sung low
and slow

unheated seas
dark rocks dissolve
into evening mists

high tide
water covers rocks
as sleep

waves breaking
the ragged shore
into sea rocks

white
alone on a dark rock
with small waves

crystal clear
the rainbow colors
of his shining

low winter sun
lights a fire
in a stone circle

wind echo
in round rocks
crystals

desert wash
every sized crystal
clear light

trees
scattered in the soil
petrified

massive rocks
wind sounds pushed
into the pines

shoreline rocks
loosening the wind's roar
from each wave

water dripping
stories etched on rock
howl in the wind

dragon jaw
biting winds claw
off-shore rocks

sun warms rock
winter storms swept bare
of frost flowers

rocks
record players
of time

old society dame
a lifetime of faces
studies the rock

long shadows
stumbling over rocks
on the way home

death valley
oldest rocks on earth
writer's block

pushing sunshine
into dark seas
slanted rocks

ancient river
draws a white line
in the tiniest stone

winter carves
in mountain rocks
deep shadow

centuries of stone
your voice echoes
forever

resting on a rock
by a snow-melt stream
winter-cold butt

low tide rocks
bubbling out of the sea
still lava

fog
in the valleys
cold hands

white winds
from snowy peaks
cover the valley

wide desert valleys
push apart peaks
soul bodies

winter shadow
a low mountain fills
the wide valley

icy streets
today of all days
his first steps

half-frozen ice
how the idiot fixes
his wayward feet

roads
in winter
stream

snow-clouds
the cooled fires
of volcanoes

passive
an extinct volcano
covered with snow

fire spirits
making mountains
out of volcanoes

volcanoes
covered with pure clouds
silent fires

jagged peaks
swirling their fires
into clouds

clouds
swirling their fires
into jagged peaks

a brick wall
splintered by frost
back to the earth

orange winter
windows beginning to dream
night fears awaken

riverstone house
water pushes snow drifts
into walls

river-rock house
at night the walls
a babbling brook

city walls
of no one
sunless dark

noises
the mossy parts
of a waterfall

snow pond
yosemite spring time
a waterfalling

falling
into water smoke
snow melt

rocks bending
sound paths
of the waterfall

from living rock
the purity of snow
waterrise

sunshine
pouring down the canyon wall
snow-melt waterfall

upward spiral
wind pushed the waterfall
into a cloud

sunshine
carves the rock
snow-melt waterfall

moving up
in the falling rain
our empty well

cold rain
falling into bean soup
chopped onions

soup cooking
in the wood stove too
rain on the roof

out shouting
rain on the roof
bean soup

candlelight
opening
shiny doorknobs

not seeing
the candle shorter
the room brighter

red candles
above a rusty wood stove
leaking light

candles
into the hot tub
firepath

dimmed lights
dried flowers imbedded in
candles

first daylight
a bowl of whey
pressed from cheese

wrinkled hand
fists of another grandchild
clasp mine

open mouthed
amazement seeing grandma
clean her glasses

winter
folded in grandma's linen closet
pure white

unpainted house
a crystal in the window
coloring the walls

after dark
the machine washing
white clothes

winter's cold
dishwater hardens
white grease

dusting
mismatched socks
in hand

silence
after the dishes are washed
a smell of cabbage

unfinished poem
because it stinks
dumping the trash

holes of winter
unseasonable snow
a mended gown

hard flash of light
stabbed by a knife
falling into water

gray dust
the fluffy cat brings something
from under the bed

knitting
death watch
a dropped stitch

freezing rain
another breakdown
in the dialysis machine

death watch
one thread
unravels

sobs
the oxygen tank
hisses

death morning
snow flakes falling
each alone

windshield wiper
not brushing away
the tears

the child that dies
before its shape is clear
in heartbeat waters

given in marriage
and with a child
she dies

sucking bones
the toothless old man
buried by a crooked pine

boiling water
to make tea
dulcimer tune

morning light
the taste of snow
in thin tea

heart-shadow
handle of a cup
of herb tea

clear tea
holding a calm
in the storm

out of the cup
cold air giving steam
a shape

a farmer
how he walks through his meadow
when his boots leak

weathered wood
the old guy leans
on the fence

for ships at sea
the sun also
sinks

arthritic knuckles
winter fogs untangle
knotted fish nets

a thin man
opening a jackknife
leans on his elbow

garage sale
buying the skinny lady's
old wide pants

foiling heredity
mother and daughter
diets

stone church
the breath of statues
frosty tonight

mountain villagers
a stony church with candles
warming each other

cry of wind
in chapel walls
chanting mouths

heavy chapel stones
weighed down with bass chanting
a cold apse

gregorian chants
sunlight on stone walls
rounding warmth

monastery
power lines on
crosses

cathedral
the many visitors
polished rocks

crystal glass
monastery bell fills
it with wine

rows of crosses
a monastery bell tolls
above the vineyard

a sermon
the deep breathing
of a sleeping child

her scarf
covering the sleeping face
a dream soul net

gnarled knuckles
knotting rag rugs
for a hope chest

dulcimer chords
patterns of a quilt
fitting together

spittle strings
collecting threads
from the new quilt

sunrise
string catches colors
on the loom

a shuttle hums
between strings
a deep twang

crippled fingers
the forgotten way
of making paper

winter drizzle
crocheting a blue rug
at the door

knitting
to farmlands
bare trees

weaving a blanket
this wood stove perfumes
carded wool

knitting
to close out the gossip
a stitch snarls

a chalk drawing
a piece of amber
very near pain

stained hands
a rag rug crocheting
winter's evening

deep in winter
the lady lives alone
unfinished baskets

foggy morning finds
a torn book of poems
the patchwork quilt

black buttons
under broken baskets
bugs stare

before the fire
deer hunters discussing
cars

old hunter
confined to setting traps
for mice

snapped!
caught in a mousetrap
a night's sleep

a broken mirror
now the ice breaker pushes apart
the joys of skating

in the 'fridge
the dark chocolate
with the door closed

the young boy
refusing to build
a snowman

incense burns
inside a moon shell
whorls of smoke

knots in wood
temple walls echo
a gong

monks slow song
of evening chanting
stomachs growl

tantra monk chants
the mouth nearest mine
breathing

monks chanting
the crooked pine
wind straightened

sun moves
over rough-sawn planks
monks chanting

one bowl koan
zen students laugh
and lap it up

channels
the balance of chi
in two hands

earth-loosened
ascending heaven
monks chant

earth heavy
chanted prayers ascend
into high humming

lessons
stars during the day
still there

alone in the forest
closing one gate
opening the other

tapered prayer
a lone pine points
into heaven

zen garden
patterns raked by falling rain
still the dust

stiff from sitting
how welcome the fire
of crooked branches

zen student
asked the way home
shows his koan

om
the fog horn
hums along

a flute concert
the cat breathes gently
through her whiskers

soprano solo
measures the cathedral's
highest praise

organ recital
loosened soot falls free
in the stove pipe

piano concert
by firelight the flickering
of notes

the oiliness
of earache medicine
organ music

organ recital
the cherub over the altar
sways in time

organ music
the school principal's words
go to my office

church organ music
wondering if my tampon
will hold it all

high tenor voice
carries into a vaulted arch
my tears

harp notes
sewing the hem
of winter's robe

madrigals
humming in pine walls
winds

soprano's aria
a cavity in my tooth
fills with pain

flute concert
salt water crashes
into silver spray

flute concert
blown from foggy skies
silver drizzle

madrigals
from the 15th century
rain continues

christmas carols
the buddhist convert
hums along

in notes from the harp
stringing together
evening hours

singing old songs
the surf rolls on the sand
its roar

winter room
warmth of a string vibrating
old songs

desert wind
composing a flute concert
in pine wood

deep at sea
wind in the harp
of whale songs

with the harp
the whole house hums
a windsong

closing his eyes
his horn finds
the blue note

plucking the strings
frozen flakes fall
far from the harp

imported
a german zither
snowflakes

saturday night
in the widow's cabin
dulcimer music

rented house
harp hollow
cold

lamplight
the room seems empty
without zither notes

going out to pee
he gives it a shake
hurries back to the fire

outdoor plumbing
with a shower of snowflakes
soap bubbles

winter nights
thawing pipes
taking a leak

stars watching
me shower
with snowflakes

starlight
all around the shower
snowflakes

clean feet
on redwood steps
a pad of snow

freezing
an outdoor shower
snow caked soap

more white
in washed-wet hair
snowflakes

winter storms
dinner by candlelight
every night

computer software
reading the new manual
by candlelight

lamplight
how small the room
without power

cheese sandwiches
warmed on the wood stove
where soup cooks

yuppie neighbors
with central heating
around the cookstove

without power
the snap sound working
in a mousetrap

haiku poets too
chop wood carry water
when the power's off

dog-eared
zen flesh zen bones
corners turned down

after the fasting
the bitterness of salt
speaking again

castle of light
a spiritual pattern
on the path

book of poems
on each page fingerprints
of a soul

breathing
underlining sentences
in a book

down from bookshelves
ancient myths come to life
thick ocean fog

paperback romances
the eyes of a woman reading
her own story

finger of darkness
a forest of black shapes
closes my book

whispers
my ancestors turning to larva
under the mounds

smoked glasses
in oak wood frames
faces

grandfather nods
portraits on a farmhouse wall
in a wobbly mirror

in a flash
not letting him die
a photograph

rest home
knitting potholders for the kitchen
she no longer has

laughter
in nursing home halls
peeling from the molding

old folks home
the no trespassing sign
faded

gentle holes
in clean underwear filling
the sewing basket

snow and sunshine
pulling cars with skis
into mountains

bouncing from snow
so young the sunshine
on childish cheeks

streaks of sunshine
sliding down the north slope
laughing children

putting away the sled
the frayed rope drags
in the mud

snowbound
digging out
haiku

catching a chill
the failure to photograph
snowflakes

shoveling her snow
the parakeet hops behind
glass frost flowers

a chapped lip sound
the neighbor shoveling snow
on a brick path

an old woman
the harshness of winter
in her hands

casting snow
from a bundle of twigs
the first warmth

borrowing twigs
his hand outstretched
to the meager fire

cold gathers
the sulphur spark
against thin wood

striking a match
dawn flashed in
the oval mirror

cloud mountain
sitting around the stove
feet on the fender

above the wood stove
the antique mirror
reflects the warmth

sunsets
in a much-used fireplace
a scratched match

deep in the forest
a blazing stove
hearts beating

black wood stove
the bright sounds
of warmth

into the clearing
wood smoke
for pea soup

a rusty wood stove
warmth spreads into the room
star-shaped

silence
a log breathing
tongues of flame

the conversation
between wood and the iron stove
our few words

behind the stove
the old clay demijohn
of firewater

burned out
remains of a cabin
a fireplace

dark in dark
then lighting logs
in the fireplace

blazing logs
gas flowers bloom
red and orange

gas flowers
warm a winter room
blazing logs

embers darken
the eastern sky
a warm glow

heavy fog
enclosing the hearth fire
gray stones

silence
warmed by a wood stove
winter

runes
cracks in hearth stones'
messages

polished red eyes
in the copper kettle
firelight

worm holes
in the blazing log
warm again

hearth stones
around dark embers
warmth

spirits
forming fire
into logs

quieter now
flames subside
in ashen sleep

rusty iron
drawing flames
above logs

punchline
sparks from a log fire
brighten the night

ah the heat
from old playboys
the fire starts

cliff side house
inside ocean spray
a fireplace

picture book
flames from a curved log
warm the heart

unfinished cabin
insulated with bookshelves
warm day and night

crash and burn
the sound of surf
in a fireplace

nights something growing
wood in the stove
a flame

humming
the started fire
my chattering teeth

winter clearance sale
the size of snowflakes
coming down together

wild with fever
dreams come wearing masks
pale at dawn

my back to the floor
walls become slatted trees
wobbly with fever

sick in bed all day
how the shape of the oak
has entertained me

after the flu
cups half-filled with tea
very small steps

even when ill
the day ends
with evening

chewing cough drops
a basket of nose-wet tissues
spill to a sneeze

around the eaves
the wind whistles
into an earache

in her fevered brain
the patterns in the quilt
solid blocks of light

winter cold
snowdrifts
of damp tissues

coughing
the sky fills with flakes
of hard snow

for grandma
with love at christmas
the flu

sickroom feeling
the fake formica
flooring

ears open
the soul follows
the pain

to smell a splinter
long under the skin
my little finger

rain predicted
calling the doctor
for an appointment

a confused brain
unscrambling the diagnosis
renal failure

at your side
the huge bandage
without comment

in the hospital
your house slippers scuffed
by our floors

after the injection
you smile at my story
and sleep

migraine
sitting in a canyon
on a split rock

recuperating
all the electricity
back in the lamp

care full
folding  the new stitches
into a chair

a fuzzy bicycle
straddling my nose
bifocals

new reading glasses
a black blur
crosses the threshold

a poultice
on my shoulder
dreams of haymaking

two days
separated by the sameness
a broken bone

cast
in plaster
throbbing

blue tin cup
the burn on a finger
blistering

steady rain
the dentist's drill
turning to snow

snowing again
a cold wind bites
the newly capped tooth

junkie
veins holding a heart
above dark waters

pain
a wound without shape
cut-away skin

winter rain
the cook eats alone
in the dining room

roof
a silent slice
into the sky

broken shells
the fishing boat pulled ashore
for winter

closed shops
a loose board bangs
on the winter wind

well-tended gardens
here lies the snow
especially deep

blunt with ice
the barge's bowsprit
anchored fast

wind
bothering the drapes
of a closed window

battery cables
giving winter's morning
a jump start

home again
my lacy white pillow
ocean surf

unpainted porch
sea fog comes
to a closed door

clearing his throat
the lawyer plays with the fob
on his watch chain

light heart
the pressure of writing
with lead pencils

ashes of incense
a page of poems
hiding words

before the journey
my last poems
copied neatly

winter shadows
poems written on the back
of an electric bill

poetry
covering holes in the wall
with a wide brush

silence
white paper
unmarked

ink blot
where haiku
sleeps

smudging
a page of poems
ashes

sleep
with the poem
written down

poetry contest
my name misspelled
on the first line

rainy weather
award propped on the table
sticks to the sugar bowl

rainy day
poems on the page
water spots

pen moving
in the dark black ink
of clear images

a chain link fence
writing renga in prison
holds him together

beach poems
written on driftwood
with charcoal

rough paper
snagging ideas
in black

writing down a poem
in that time-space
the fire takes hold

morning's faint light
seeing again the words
in the sent letter

cows in the barn
the wet eye in the meadow
frozen shut

tall tales
of bears on the ridge
a garbage can tips

winter day
as a hairless bear
sleeping sleeping

flying from the branch
sun in a bird's wing
a shower of snow

blackbirds leaving
on bare winter wands
pussy willows

winter birds
kicking down fireworks
from snowy twigs

arranged
on bare branches
bird songs

bare branch
extended by a bird
in flight

river clouds
clots of black birds
darken the sky

a flutter of wings
yet the bare branch
stays bent

story of a life
in a foreign language
nut hulls on melting snow

drawing cliffs
a black bird
the brush

feathered wing
tips jagged sea
rocks sharp north wind

mirrored
in a bird cage
a child's face

winter dawn came
as the sound of blowing snow
sleeping birds

thin wet snow
the warm wiggle within
a cocoon

what dreams
holding on one's lap
a sleeping cat

dreaming
her quivering paws
still catching mice

into a windy night
the cat takes her cries
to be let in

winter's cat
all of her wants
in my lap

winter stars
cat claws in the screen door
desperately cold

storm wind
in the cat's teeth
meowing

cold
comes to bed at two
the white cat

his dog moves closer
the owner quotes a price
for land and trees

injured dog
all of his words
in one eye

the dog
scratches as owner
his fleas

only vertebrae
the found white flowers
of a pet dog

a barking dog
little bits of night
breaking off

dark voices
of night bushes
a dog barks

a pekinese
barking at mozart's aria
then everyone claps

crunch of bones
in the hollow places
between the dog's teeth

retreating waves
a tiny barking dog
has them scared

dolphins
arching rainbows
of opal light

hands in the light
at peace demonstrations
the flutter of doves

eagle soars
beyond boundary lines
a judge on a bench

line of words
holding the day
we saw the eagle

snow white
egrets preen their feathers
by cotton fields

nobility
wading in up to their knees
egrets

an egret
the elegance of patience
in a tide pool

salt sea
the bones of fish
crystallized

red winter's dawn
trout for breakfast
slightly smoked

ripples in water
fish spines
and mine

mountain moon
part of the ice-rimmed pond
eyes of trout

scaling fish
from the waning moon
snowflakes

thawing
frozen fish
caught in summer

shapes of geese
cut from the snowy whiteness
nothing lacking

a sneeze
in the old sea gull's
knobby knees

white surf
lining the coast
a band of gulls

screaming
at the booming surf
a band of gulls

silent sea creatures
feeding
the cries of gulls

passing flock
out of a clear blue sky
cry of a lone gull

visiting sea gulls
on a winter beach
an old couple

winter storm
landing with a sea gull
one feather falls free

sea gulls
the sacred script
in blue

sea gulls
lifting from wild surf
spindrift

shadow on the sea
a wave forming
a gull's wing

a blue heron
staring at
a blue heron

deep snow
the horse walks the paths
of summer

a white cloud
hanging on the horse's nose
to keep warm

riderless horses
in the high road sky
before the storm

with the thaw
buckling the old saddle
on a frisky horse

snowbound
black and white horses
stay in the stall

a white stallion
sea fog on snow
suddenly solid

high-tide beach
filling hoof tracks
horses

my new road
violated by a horse
ridden by a stranger

after days of rain
the first sunbeam on the road
a galloping horse

riding in waves
horse tracks on wet sand
scalloping

wet monkey hair
organ grinder's tinkley tunes
in a cold rain

in winter walls
our own mice hoard
the warmth

wind moving grasses
quick as a mouse
stealing seeds

a mouse
immeasurable
in me

the mouse and i share
her nest in the sock drawer
my house in the woods

high tide
mussel soup
ready to eat

from his tongue
wind tears the screech
of a snow owl

sea fog wings
over coastal hills
a white owl

wind
in the snow owl's wing tips
whoo

moving
a handful of moonlight
the owl's wing

your snoring
the owl answers
some dreams

night skies
on the owl's breast
dawn

cathedral canyon
suddenly an indian maid says
see the white owl?

night skies
under the owl's wing
mouse hearts

ham and beet tops
for dinner our neighbor's
pet pig

solar cells
in polar bear hairs
ice crystals

thawing
the face of the lake
plovers crying

raccoon's silence
emptying garbage can fill
the night with sound

waterfront motel
for $125 a night
watching the rats

fertilizer sack
hiding the salamander dreams
up more magic

sandpipers
skimming from the beach
silence

mother sheep
in her mouth melts
hoar frost on grass

stop sign
the sparrow lands with a bug
dead in its mouth

patterns
on the starfish
snow crystals

notes arranged
on telephone poles
starling songs

three-string banjo
songs of starlings
on telephone wires

after the dart game
in new fallen snow
deer tracks

on the path
the hop marks of rabbits
wink of snow

thanks for crumbs
scattered on the frozen snow
seed hulls with tracks

circling us
vultures sense
a rotting marriage

whale migration
mapped
songs

whale songs
long slow straight
grain in wood

quiet sea
only migrating whales
blow

ocean depths
sunlight laces history
in whales

south on highway one
passing whales
headed north

newspaper folded
all eyes drawn seaward
by passing whales

evening
sunsets into the sea
a guide for whales

hot tub steam
in ocean fog
whale songs

whales
following the quarter moon
with half-closed eyes

whales
dividing the ocean
east and west

a wall of water
curves and crashes
a whale

great ears
whale bodies ocean deep
messages

sand and rocks
building whales bones
sea stars

sea surprise
plumes of whale breath
bell buoy clanging

small bumps
on wide blue seas
whales

stars
whales
roadmaps

a high hill
calls to a whale
lighthouse

to sleep
where whales deep
and dolphins play

bones buried
in the backs of whales
their hind legs

floating island
carrying its own cloud of mist
migrating whale

whistling swans
birthdeath of a wet year
on a green wing

goose pimples
seeing in winter
many whistling swans

the wild duck
as if to shake off frost
the moonlight

winter
coming around the bend
wild ducks

dawn even lighter
than snow covered branches
cry of ducks

winter fly
chased by the rainbows
of cut glass

a night howl
from deep in a wolf
into the dark

tall dead pine
the tiny holes of the woodpecker's
pantry

a small brown wren
trapped in my house
i in my realm

swollen
the amaryllis bud
already red

low-slanted sun
in the red amaryllis
turning on lights

live oaks
changing their shapes
the fog

leaving the light
trunks of tall trees
sink into roots

in the clearing
hovering a circle of trees
their halos

bare trees
hidden in purple vapor
swollen buds

german gray
decorated with snow
popsicle trees

wood smoke
shaping the radiant bodies
of trees in winter

melted snow water
trickling over the veins
of a dried beech leaf

crossed at the ankles
her lovely legs
among young birches

birches
in the beveled glass
winter

snow rain
the thin birch branches
so very slender

white birches
black and white in snow
at lava point

the fire dies
among naked birches
burned bones

black forest
night extinguishes
the snow

sun and snow
still in the pines
the black forest

rusty red the bracken
its shape lost as the cold
takes the bird's wing

winter bracken
frail hands push aside
a garden path

after the storm
rain covers the scar
a branch blown away

whalebone tree limb
to rock this child
the sun's passing

winter freeze
buds of passion flower
faint with pink

rhododendron park
buds too
closed till spring

silence
of winter leaves
tightly rolled buds

bent cedars
facing north all night
snow-covered

before rice shoots
in paddy ponds the tips
of ancient cedars

low clouds
bending cedar tips
rain

mountain winds
from the unseen temple
cedar incense

cementing
the cedars in place
sea fog

rooted in rocks
winter rains
twist a cypress

sky calligraphy
the pruned cypress
grown tall

her tinkling laugh
dried weeds stiff
with ice

thin dune grass
weaving winter sunshine
warm into the wind

white rim
of wild winter seas
withered grass

water music
sea winds scraping
frozen grass

seeds scattered
around the evergreen trees
a complete circle

silver tipped
snow deepening
fir silence

well-watered
the hothouse violet
withers

storm seas
tearing from sea cliff rocks
ice plants

granite boulders
footprints from dancing
covered with lichens

spaced out
tiny manzanita flowers
among snowflakes

bouncing
out of manzanita bushes
hail and blossoms

stronger white
blossoms remaining
after the hailstorm

resort in winter
the black fountains
of oaks

wrinkles in hills
shadows of crooked branches
of barren oaks

all their halos
falling in the soup
onions

pulling onions
sea fog drift apart
neighbors come by

red candle
holding a bunch of oranges
for the winter sun

winter sun
wet silk folded
in an orange

winter storms
as plumes of surf rise
pampas grass nods

red-breasted birds
among ripe persimmons
hiding from the cold

north wind
spinning snow blossoms
into bare plum

snowfields
black pine roots twist
a dark stream

scrawny pines
all twigs and branches
in scanty snow

a crowing crow
up the canyon a wind
sharp pine fragrance

cliff hanging
in a gnarled pine
crooked sunshine

alive again
morning sun
on the dead pine

snow-bending
pine boughs
drifted

crossing to the island
pines have arrived
before us

deep in the forest
the taper of pines
brightens the clearing

high principles
inner power of pine trees
reaching the sky

pine needles
sticking into the fog
raindrops

moving around
the wind in the pines
comes home

snow-covered pines
yosemite falls
in white water plumes

wind fury
in its shape
a crooked pine

shadow of a tall pine
sweeping an arch
low around the earth

a split rock
pine shadow
slips in

sighing
wind takes from pines
their history

spindrift
hangs in shore pines
moss

wisps of fog
writing persian poetry
with the pine

bright red leaves
held so high by a winter stem
poinsettia

country christmas
under a sprinkle of stars
stringing popcorn

rain in the reeds
in her mind the river flows
backwards

withered reeds
all bent one way
by ice

even colder
the breath of the north wind
between broken reeds

meandering stream
dark amidst the snow
twisted roots

winter willows
a vase full of roots
rain runs from

the meekness
of trees with roots exposed
the icy creek

mountain pines
moving as i walk
these rootless things

sagebrush
sweetened with snow
plump flowers

sage brush blooms
five inches of snow
purified

cleaner
on the sagebrush
snow

sky writing
sedges gracefully line
mirror marsh

snow-melt
speaking to noble sequoias
in whispers

giant sequoia roots
running away
in a snow-melt stream

fantasy
in an old sequoia
a brown bear

standing alone
the elegance of sequoia
balanced

giant sequoia
a finger counting rings
touches history

keeping cameras away
the imperial height
of sequoias

running water
giant sequoia roots
not moved

sequoias
their tallness presses
roots in rocks

sequoias
their roots
rocks

yosemite
after all the waterfalls
uplifted by sequoias

2000 year old tree
it should live forever
whispers a child

snow-melt stream
the sound of giant sequoias
growth

cinnamon red
the last rays of sun
in fragrant trees

cinnamon red
the fragrance of sequoia
in the color

on the wooden path
old folks walk slowly
among ancient trees

on frozen snow
still warm from the cow barn
broken straw

surrounding a tree
the puzzling shapes
of sugar-pine bark

tumbleweeds
piled against barbed wire
snow's lacy patterns

winter rain
on holland's tulip spears
empty rooms

vines
against a brick schoolhouse
clinging snow

small bushes
cover the desert floor blue
winter sunset

up to a branch
wind took a winter leaf
let it fall again

snow
cooling the colors
withered leaves

frost spikes
the growing cold
of withered leaves

a new year
rising from wild seas
a few stars

be begin the year
fresh sheets of winter's night
snow

moon mirror
reflecting a wrinkled face
born the same day

my age
spoken four years ago
a younger sound

birthday beach walk
wetted by a wave
born again

a huge wave
thundering across the beach
my birthday

in the tub
the day before
being born

bells
in the natal place
a uterus opens

sky-clad
the new-born comes wrapped
in previous lives

mountain echo
i'm older
when i hear it

a shower of diamonds
my birthday gift
from a snowy branch

that too
a present of sour plums
on my birthday

feeling older
the new calendar doesn't fit
the dirty wall

a new calendar
my unlived days
already numbered

filling
the glass with candlelight
champagne

champagne bubbles
fifty years
up my nose

drought year
ends with champagne
rain

champagne sleep
tolling bells ring out
the old year

last of the year
the ferry boat leaves
for another shore

snow
it barely covers
end of the year

open mouths
in the clanging bells
end of a year

end of a year
book pages
stick together

a new year's friend
up the down mountain
our flow of words

old year departs
on the highest tide
in history

cold
rolling into a wave
last day of the year

last day of the year
walking a country lane
to the end of it

leap year
suddenly on the beach
a gigantic wave

new year's breakfast
peeled cold eggs
snowflakes

new year's day
tarnish on the silver mirror
fits

threading a needle
on new year's day
the spool unwinds

new year's day
granola breakfast special
with chocolate chips

new year's day
the warmth of touching
dulcimer strings

new year's day
between clouds the sun
a bright beginning

new year's day
a wind-blown twig
writing on snow

night snows
the words on new year's day
clean and white

new year's day
at land's end
a lighthouse

snow white birds
on sea-foam beaches
new year's day

prosperous new year
the ocean full
of whales

new year's day
meeting the neighbor's smile
with cold on my teeth

a mountain of ink
spilled on white paper
new year's day

new year's day
reading another how-to book
with broken glasses

a new year's dream
very close to shore
a whale blows

together yet
telling my new year's dream
to the pillow

new year's morning
the first day begins
in the same dream

new year's day
waking together
in the dream

alone
at the end of the road
a new year's party

new year's eve
the angel atop the pine
a full moon

new year's eve
on the country porch the sound
of a full moon

the first gong
pushed out of the steeple
by the second one

new year's parade
in strict formation gulls fly
over a lonely beach

new year's snow
a radiance in dark pines
white full moon

new year's day
no resolutions for me
i've shoveled snow

days shortened
tall pines crowding
the year's turn

year of the horse
moon and mars
rising together

year of the monkey
beginning in new hampshire
national elections

year of the ox
yoked together
our little jokes

year of the rabbit
moving in and out of
holes in the garden fence

year of the rat
the ad man has designs
on mickey mouse

year of the sheep
the wolf at the door
is nuclear

year of the snake
a banner waving
she's my friend

balmy breeze
swarming bees circle
the river bank

whitecaps on the bay
the overhead cries
of migrating birds

deep within the lettuce
a slug shaped hole

siskins' trill
sunlight floods
the bare larch

drifting fog
an acquaintance
i'd rather not meet

frost lingers
i clean brussels sprouts
in the kitchen sink

boat house
the graying planks
one with the cliff

the small cabin
one room
and a sauna

summer's day
a dad shows his son
grandpa's work

on the jetty
above the fish
my feet

soft breeze
the gentle hum
of a beehive

spring morning
in the hands of the child
daffodils!

insomnia
in my waterglass
moonbeams

spring dusk
more and more stars
on wet branches

dance studio
a crack in the mirror glued
with paper hearts

my ear conch
to your ear conch
sounds of the sea

sunny noon
a wheel-less scooter
at the pub door

housewarming
a kitten chases
his own tail

i draw the snow
said the child
with an empty sheet

winter zoo
a rat walks in
the monkeys’ cage

leaving home
a curve carved off
the moon

stepping into
the same snowpath
year of the monkey

another glass of champagne
remembering what i choose
to remember

cluster of juncos
in the apricot tree
silent snow

twist of dust
across the plaza
going home

dry leaves
in a snow pocket
blind faith

midwinter
a red amaryllis
lights the fire

overgrown path
saskatoons ripe
for the picking

textured light
the lily
fills with dew

rainy spring
carrots sprouting
among the peas

folded poppies
await the light
summer solstice

a butterfly’s
feather-light breath
spring sun

approaching dusk
a single raven
claims the sky

spring mist
the last swans sail
into the sun

from somewhere beyond the pines
the cry of a child
not my own

christmas long gone
three crows
in the pear tree

so like my own plans
hms resolution sunk
next to endeavor

one mosquito
and the sun porch
suddenly too small

goldenrod
i wade through a field
of autumn light

smoky amber beads
the music box plays
fly me to the moon

still carrying
summer on its wings
swallowtail

sudden thunder
a juvenile mallard
snaps at a gnat

sparrowfight
in elderbush
spring thunder

lingering daylight
i pick a primrose
for its taste

heavy snowfall
a hawk on a fence post
almost white

winter depression
the color of rain
in the river

whitecaps
a gull's wingtips
taming the wind

the languages
we learned as children
moss-covered stump

first light
shadows of branches stroke
the bedroom ceiling

winter solstice
i message my sons
dinner’s ready

sleet
the draft
of the scythe

drifting clouds
what the trees don’t know
about the grasses

cloudy skies
the other thing
she was about to do

winter sun
in the cut down forest
a lone moose

high speed train
along the railway line
wild apple trees

home town
slowing down my pace
as i count lampposts

looking at you
without the squint now
winter sun

silent hour
a snowflake tiptoeing
on the window pane

embracing
smell of tobacco
from the empty lift

windy
your hair tells
everything

two voids
clinking each other
christmas balls

new year's eve
looking for batteries
among snow maidens

soul searching
i punch all the buttons
in my new car

sighing
the narrative
of snow

morning chill
petroglyphs etched
with frost

first snow on the mountains
the ponderosa
appear

sandhill cranes
lifting off the bosque
the earth tilts

from window
to window
still snow

cutting me off
at the inbound lane
crescent moon

white on white
snow buntings
rise from the mist

morning sun
the smell of rice tea
in an iron pot

stiff fingers
the warmth
of crackling flames

past midnight
on the lake
geese still squabble

the smell of horses
on the trail
a cougar’s tracks

wild cleft
the sough of wind
on sintered snow

receding whistle
of the last train
a cold trek home

distant thunder
the crash of coins
in the beggar's bowl

in the musician's garden
weeds growing
con brio

last of the fall color
a black limousine
glides by

first oriole
i follow its song
to a magnolia

my son skips
all the way to the park
spring runoff

autumn
buzzing at my ear
last wasp

drought
the garden gate
swings open

less so in winter
black headed gulls

happy hour
the shopping mall santa
takes off his suit

a moving van
stalls the traffic
morning frost

canal boat's interference
rocking waterfowl

what a crow dropped
sinks the river's darkness

collared doves
cooing again
the cold rain

flickering street light
from darkness to darkness
the flight of a bat

monsoon
you take my hand

the conversation
grinds to a halt
peak oil

fog
my own headlights
blinding me

gale
the moorings
reinforced

morning frost
she curls up
even smaller

open sky
the sea claims the sand
under my feet

first frost
water runs slowly
in the fountain

first snow
the football field lines
slowly vanish

home city
touching the inner side
of the bridge

night cafe
my jacket on the back
of the next chair

up their necks in ice
the leaves of grass
so green

first frost
everybody brings his own
cloud

in a leafless park
sweeter rowanberry
and darker crows

empty beach
the rain fills
her prints

unlikely truth
a milkweed pod
cracks open

change of life
cutting into a vein
of chard

dark afternoon
the weight of air

mountain chill
his tightly kerned
words

hot summer night
click of mahjong tiles
lifts the air

soaked in sky
a prairie morning
blooms

autumn dusk
the wilting apple tree
lit from within

smell of ripe wheat
thresher blades
catch the sun

digging potatoes
a yodel
from the loon’s last chick

feathers of hoarfrost
ravens await
the dawn

winter camping
cooking
with moonlight

on all sides the prairie
touches sky
winter stubble

bare cottonwoods
the river folds back
and back again

in darkness
footfalls
of mule deer

shifting
my point of view
the skunk

snow flurry
tasting his chapstick
on my lips

frosted windows
i toss more greens
in the soup

once again
lifting my spirits
balloon flower

falling blossoms
the snap of the cards
as he folds

gusty day
the windmill motionless
on the delft beer stein

mixing spices
for a mild curry
ginger fall

moonrise
a basketball bounces
off the hoop

heat haze
the road ahead sinks
into its mirage

winter dawn
the preening magpie's
pink-tinged breast

new coolness
the postman leaves a note
without ringing

sheets of rain
along the foothills
summer lethargy

nightfall
poplar seeds
keep drifting

the hooded crow's
gray underbelly
snow bearing clouds

small hours
the frosted edge of a glass
sickle moon

after the rain
a glimmer of sun
in the gutter

spring morning
a wild boar turns over
my neighbors lawn

insomnia
the cold on the other side
of the pillow

at the edge
of a round-up crop field
cornflowers

blackness staring
into that old pond

she always
loved the blues
forget me not

leaf fall
a new baby hat
in neighbor's stroller

client meeting
a black rook paces
the gold of leaves

sunshower
my umbrella chasing
daughter's balloon

lying in fall leaves
i wait for
the next one

village morning
ashes of two moths
in the candlestick

autumn draft
helicopters descend
from the maple tree

sunset
the shadows of her legs
grow longer

leaving
nothing to doubt
summer hail

evening walk
a dry leaf
chases me home

sundown
that one note sparrow
finally silent

summer rainstorm
the old elm embraces
its scar

distant thunder
the mountains
move closer

midsummer
we stroke light rain
into night music

in a stand
of shadows
ponderosa pine

winter waves
eiders keep
their down

arctic blast
the birch
grow sideways

blue sky day
wild geese wait
for the thaw

long shadows
the fading call
of a jay

arctic storm
whitecaps pound
an empty shore

almost daybreak
the crows
suddenly silent

paling moon
a loon’s
atonal cry

snowy wood
the hush in a cathedral
of norway spruce

white eyelet curtains
snow piles up
on the cedars

crescendo
of wind
the kettle boils

calling me back
from my thoughts
bellflowers

wind in the poplars
we both
speak at once

snow lantern
across the pond
a white magnolia

between the butterfly
and the sky
forsythia

it has been too long
since we last kissed
with waxwings

tick of wind
crows parlay
in the bush

sunday at noon
no sense of
shorter days

late arrival
headlights point
to crickets

oxygen high
slow steps around
the dead chipmunk

flotilla of branches
mastering the sway

gap in the trees
i see the lake
behind a moose

nose prints
on the patio door
belting rain

dew
on meadow grass
soaked to the bone

magpie chase
from branch to branch
the yellow wind

fall migration
the dog covered
in duckweed

beaver logs
too huge carry
morning mist

red leaf rustle
my stick hidden
in the deepest bush

sleeping longer
at the foot of the bed
autumn equinox

shoebox memories
one size fits tall

montana
the cowboy hat my son wants
fits me

mono versus stereo
the rain
begins and ends

river opening
the politician promises
faster

the eulogy
mascara runs
gothic

autumn breeze
a kitten heads off
the fallen leaf

autumn morning

collects the village cactus fruits

talks about war
dad walks on the reef
barefoot

vast blue sky
for the second time
dad rolls his newspaper

early morning news
the suburb chimney issues
darkness

abandoned station
the broken sign darts
to a new direction

the mourning flute
i listen
to the player's eyes

empty nest
i walk through the house
naked

a cigarette hangs
from the old lady's lips

prints in the sand

clings to her nest

on the surface

speeding
at twelve

feeding sepia lettuce
to the tortoise

granddad in his rocker
their creaks in sync

sweater weather
the bullfrog's
absent croak

limbs leafless
but the wind
an iron-clad alibi

having a night
on the town
the fog

in the family nest
ruffled feathers

ready to pick pumpkins
their withered roots
umbilical cords

nip in the air
twitch
of the fox's tail

full moon
ghost crabs
race their shadows

beachcombing
pistachio
shell

suspended
in my hammock
spider web

the long shadows
of sunflowers

the river full
of stars

measuring
the marsh grass
harrier

between the lines

the smell
of sweat

bigger
balloons

a fixer-upper
feral sunflowers
fill the gate

a weed flowers
the hoarder's yard

burial vaults
a warmly lit billboard
above the snow

amazing grace
no skylight for gulls
to gray

salmon fished
the weir's
bones

unfinished wall
a balloon seller pats
the trapped mountain stones

starry night
fireflies take away
their shadows

spring sanctuary
a kitten buries
its own shit

shadowless summer
the old bike's wheels' creaking
over and over

reading lesson
at the end of each sentence
a full stop

ocean of ink
i drink
my tea

after the rain
a chameleon jumps
on to the washed path

heat wave
the sweet scent of rain
in humid air

years later
the armadillo's skeleton
still on the roadside

approaching storm
the dog growls
with the thunder

windstorm
palm-sized spider clings
to my window pane

receding tide
the merging together
of black and white sands

dawn
tree tops dipped
in sunlight

fresh mown lawn
a lone dandelion
stands tall

day moon
lavender in the air

old boats
fleeting colors
haunt the silt

chequered sky
gulls and crows
weigh each turn

hedged views
the cherry tree
where we meet

joined
in the churchyard
nettle tea

sunday's child
teaching a kitten
to genuflect

hibernating
i miss the harebell

no trespassing
but the weeds
can't read

found
in the cookie jar
her false teeth

flash of anger
in her eyes
snapdragon

whale watch
floating islands
again and again

flock of white doves
lace the sky
my grandmother's doilies

electrical storm
enough sizzle
to curl my toes

returns

and i

aligned

with an accent

my shadow
left behind

from an unknown nest

of my old notebook

starts purring

the scented dream
of a gardenia

parrots and humans

blowing in the wind

on a brown vine

and car fumes

on a sliver of lemon
near total eclipse

beneath the statue
do not climb

against the glass

its highs and lows

from its mother

on my ice cream

leads me on

by his song

her tail

at the stars

with sheep

comes and goes

third anniversary
the hawkers selling pearls
at discount rates

the corn kernels

on the silver ashes
the black
of a used kettle

no moonlight
a rickety pier strikes
through the dark sea

barren trees
even the tiniest twig
embraced by the mist

the floating sky
in her half-empty glass

spring mist
a lost crab in our garden
folds its claws

winter snow
a red bird pecks
the empty birdfeeder

leaves rain
on my roof

broken shadows
splatter the lawn

after last night's storm
a tiny white feather
floats in a puddle

a full moon
between fractured branches

invited

on picnic rock
mosquitoes

for my toes

the curve
of her back

with the tide

floodwaters
the old oak
rooted in the river

in the company
of kings and queens

salt marsh
a flash of silver
in the heron's beak

spring rain
the dog's coat finer
than mine

the song
of a single cricket
harvest moon

after curfew
a snow angel fills
with moonlight

last day of winter
snootful of snow

fresh snow
chewing the stuffing
out of my cow

spring hike
the stick
as long as the dog

fireplace logs
burning to ash
mouth full of squeak

arrows of geese
the puppy chases
leaves on the wind

last year's grass
another dog
fetches my ball

winter
puppy whimpers
spring rain

thunder
when the
time comes

along the twilit
summer ridge a coyote
drags my eye

calling the bobwhite
as if it knows its name

over snow
the red waiting
of forsythia

like all the others
particle decay

sooner or later
partially cloudy

two feet beneath
the crusted snow
garden waiting

yukon hike
water sloshes to the beat
of the bear bell

the smack of sandals
on the sidewalk
summer rain

lone yellow flower
in the graveyard
october sun

embarking
up the wrong tree
squirrel

at the tulip festival
she holds a bouquet
of dandelions

campsite with the view
a gull
steals the hot dog buns

break in the showers
wind in the trees
sounds like rain

so much to say
and you are gone
twilight sky

winter again
somehow a coriander leaf
inside my wallet

many more rounds
before the sprinkler stops
summer lawn

ghost town
sound of army boots from
alley to alley

autumn sky
swaying wheat field
shaping the wind

winter solstice
a charas pipe making rounds
around the bonfire

vanished airplane
the void left behind

hyphenated
the twig between
branches

wedged
between syllables
a stray thought

late evening
the street empties
child by child

left brain
a half-chewed
poem

winter solstice
a furlong of a dream
curls inside me

not so long ago
the color of silence

from the corner
of my eye
pigeon's flight

station emptying
most of the leak
missing the bucket

melting snow
the grass appreciates
and appreciates

a day of rain
the street cleaner clears
one puddle into another

first day of spring
my popcorn bar
raining pops

tourists
pouring over their map
summer rain

blue sky morning
the hospital huffs
the only clouds

at odds with the world
tilt of passing brollies

pauses
the tiger lilies
the road construction signs

mourning
the frost
on the power line

summer shade
only the grasshopper
ticks time

off grid
spring stars
beyond my breath

still-life lilies
residents sitting
in the nursing-home lounge

the street artist
brush-strokes the sidewalk
summer sunset

longing for spring
even the frozen-flow
from the water spout

out beyond
the lit night sky
meteor belief

old age
made braver
by the sea

at the same time
as the first time
afterwardness

tracking your path
by the lights you turn on
fireflies

here i am
and so on
without repeating

ocean swim
not knowing what's
beneath me

out of a dark marsh
a doom of bitterness

white building
site crane

toy dump truck
the sidewalk
clear of snow

yukon forest
after months of snow
crocus

the crosswalk sign
terns overhead
chirping

high tide
wild blackberry canes
overtake the shore

flies circle the room
the second hand
of the clock face

first frost
the outdoor runners
hibernate

evening mist
a drunk man stops me to
ask the way to the moon

stranded
where her neckline takes a dip
a blue vein

golden thaw
from peak to peak
mountain sunrise

adding wings
to our eyelashes
butterfly kiss

year's end
only the sound of mouse clicks
from every desk

garden walk
in and out of my mind
a butterfly

air hostess
her eyeliner's tail pointing
towards the sky

december
incomplete to-do lists
in the bin

rehashing my wish
birthday candles

forked road
the choices that
never mattered

graffiti
someone else crosses
my t's

spring again
a songbird's paean
at dawn

ending
before it begins
amuse bouche

wet asphalt
fallen flowers more
yellow

thinning crowds
the station mouse obeys
the keep left sign

chalking off
the days to christmas
neighbor's wreath

footpath closed
the pedestrian arrow points
to anywhere

year's end
purple cyclamen
outside the florist

empty restaurant
all the tables
candlelit

two pigeons
strolling outside
the morning mist

another year
the tree rag
ever more ghostly

war news
even the chickadees
fight at the feeder

spring dawn
the neighbor's hound
sings with me

driving over gravel
the grit
of a country song

souvenir t-shirts
in the closet
summer vacations

rolling thunder
the bass on the car stereo
passing by

spring cleaning
the soccer ball
where snow melted

back to routine
after vacation
mouldy orange

a maw
with feathers
spring

winter drizzle
the blue in the black
of crows

chunks of carrot
in the carrot puree
midwinter

returning
to the universe
the stench of a deer

the first shovelful
on the coffin
the loudest

receding
into the scenery
nature

summer cloud
feathers on the wind

daybreak
the egg
cracks open

stocking
empty to the toe
the spray of citrus

the busker
buttons his collar
north winds blowing

oh the wind
pounding
on the wind

solstice sunshine
snowflake caught
in a spiderweb

night train
at the end of her back zip
a safety pin

half bloomed rose
an ant enters into
its fragrance

pattern of her
fingertips on my bare back
midnight rain

tipsy night
searching for the milky way
between double moons

after the rain
only a few petals left
with the rose

meditation hour
sound of someone's broom
clearing trash

waking me up
from my midnight dream
glass bangles

digital clock
blinking

over tea
he tells me he misses
his mom's coffee

between heartbeats
a flickering candle

father's day
more glitter on my fingers
than on the card

the dull thrum
of lights
cityscape

last leaf standing
autumn's dervish

when there's nothing
left to say
eclipse

heathrow planes
coming to the fore
morning song

espresso bar
latest tech
passing me by

autumn's last month
still awaiting
my inheritance

twenty yards
from another rat
rainy spring

a line of gulls
fencing the shoreline
unbroken sun

everything i'm not
autumn sunset

slap bang
in the middle of a squabble
park gulls

holding onto summer
the last sweat-pea
bouquet

the whole field
mushrooms
constant construction

leaves falling
in the river
going with the flow

well being
the rooster's crow
on the hour

pausing to ponder
the dragonfly
on my pen's point

beach volleyball
the swat
of mosquitoes

the wasp
in the glass of wine
skinny dipping

block of flats
i know how
my neighbor lives

big thaw
the clouds closer
to the earth

porcupine quill
a day of big wind

jet lag
my watch
needs resetting

almost too
dark to see
bats

all night drive
the moon goes full
and past

ice in the driveway
she slips
into something more comfortable

unkindness of ravens
at the side of the highway
blood-stained snow

paper cup flowers
in the garden

cars drive by
snow collects
on the roadside wreath

tax time
a gnome hunches over his desk
in the garden

evening
swallows
shadows

gusts of wind
rattle the deck chairs
early autumn

rose garden
i tuck another dream
into her hair

monsoon sky
from someone's guitar
come september

garden buddha
the glow of his face
even after sunset

spring morning
guessing the color of
the first rose bud

a whiff of jasmine
as she unties her hair
hint of rain

monsoon lull
the street dog in search
of a dry spot

cloudy day
all the sunflowers facing
each other

blackout
even our shadows
don't touch

dreams
crossing frontiers
boxcar

sunflowers
my laughter too a shade
of yellow

crimson leaves
the evening rustles
into a hush

cold feet
in warm socks
spring thaw

jamun tree
the stains of summer
on my lips

graphite moon
a bat's wing spans
its radius

long afternoon
i decide on
the red apple

border trim
the gardener's
straw hat

all that remains
of the gutted house
summer heat

spring evening
dragging the
moon along

a better day
the sink ant granted
a reprieve

water
sliding off the station roof
summer's end

wine tasting
another empty bottle
hums in the wind

rusted mailbox
the message
that slipped my mind

willow grove
the feral cat
purrs

in the art supply drawer
a mouse
with her nest

contract signed
the wind catcher
twirls to the right

tanned knees
through ripped jeans
end of summer

in the country road ditch
the black bra
fills with snow

no temple bell
needed
the woodpecker's tap

doughnuts for dessert
the zen master
only eats the center

schoolyard
the acorns
have all lost their caps

no hands on the handlebars 
riding past 
the pretty girl

clown car
nothing works
but the horn

log cabin window
the snow flakes
take their time landing

art festival
mimes work
the silent auction

even the leaves
make no sound
tundra

alpine nightfall
tent pegs planted
in a bed of stars

wing dip
sea birds
northern swell

long morning chill
the rise
and fall
of dock iron

autumn dusk
not feeding
the geese

river eddy
the ripples of fish
catching twilight insects

arctic sun
rising
fulmars circle the ship

midday sun
a hill sits
on its own shadow

coastal rain
idle excavators stand
on the sea-edge

darkness thickening
the last water bird vacates
the lake

hospital wards
morning reaches the top floor
through the lift

morning lights
an egret cluttering
yesterday's foot prints

patchy rain
cars from downtown enter
with wet panes

snake hole
the tail of a train
in the hill tunnel

dusk
a green bee eater
gets lost in greens

just as swift
as a passing dream
a deer

midnight
the heavy noise of
trickling rain

giving away its fragrance
to the passing breeze
a champak

still holding
onto the shores
a broken boat

morning
a busy spider weaving
leaf to leaf

full moon
the cotton sprouts shivering
the night away

black silk
the larvae slips out
of its skin

the transparency
of a shadfly's wings
evening sun

streaks of beach
smudging the horizon
brush fire

river bend
a great blue heron curves
from sight

light pollution
the fireflies flickering
out

the wide eyes
on the moth's wings
harvest moon

berry wine
the chipmunk teeters
along the branch

stale arguments
a blackbird mending
pine shadows

first snowflakes
painting the dark side
of the full moon

plum blossoms
the night distils into
birdsong

deep shadows
a glow worm exhales
the milky way

brown yellow leaves
the dog digs up
a cloud

hovering
over summer clouds
mom's lullaby

laughter
dripping from her elbows
mango orchard

autumn deepens
my mother's shadow
before me

that lull
after the wind dies
cicada shell

snoring deep
in the night the
river frogs call

long summer rains
mixing the colors
of hydrangea

the garden
gone to seed
sunflowers

trade winds
arriving on
greenmarket day

light air
sailing lessons
focusing on the little things

knee deep in heather
the purple scent
of summer

hay harvest
summer sun wrapped up
for winter

hedge clearing
fledglings
in a flap

out of the mist
a charm of butterflies
court the wind

ear
of barley
crescent moon

march stroll
the sun follows us
into the hills

into a spring noon
my garden shoes and i
shedding cobwebs

one by one
into the sea
fishermen

new bridge
a river coming to terms
with the stone pilings

dissipated rain
dim flicker of lightning
in the distant sky

temple tank
near the stone bull
a real bull

still pond
a crooked coconut tree licks
its own image

straight fall
from the roof
dead rain

passing boat
a river bend hides
the boatman's song

dusk
a whistling thrush waits
on the fence

mountain hike
how the mist hides
the trail

outshining
last night's storm
cuckoo song

sunrise
a snail crawling through
the dew drops

deep noon
a squirrel chases a tree
shadow

drifting skies
the color of
changing seasons

walking along
with an old melody
humming bird

storm warning
the calm at the eye
of the potato

wild irises
along the shoreline
goslings sleep

bachelor buttons
the best man catches
the bouquet

sheared sheep
poplar cotton swirling
in the breeze

undercurrents
the snapping turtle
surfaces

heat lightning
knee-deep in lily pads
the heron strikes

indigo dye
the hurried moon
rushes on

mountain lay-by
the call of a blackbird
carries me onward

distant waterfall
an ounce of sun over
the icy rumble

moon bow
her scent slips away
like silk

strumming
my guitar the abandon
of a lark's flight

midnight moon
the violet of violets
almost black

death verse
a fisher woman scales
the moonlight

moon breath
the sharper slant of
my shadow

early autumn
falling for
the last time

fast moving current
never pausing for breath

antique pink lacecap
something new in
the bride's bouquet

the pause before
puddle jumping
still plum rains

endless summer
every morning strains
from an untuned violin

dry lakebed
listening for
what does not come

scraping
night away
morning frost

washing day
sheets billow
shaping the breeze

out of the thicket
a pair of
pecking pheasants

suspended
between bare branches
crescent moon

graveyard visit
a white butterfly
on angel wings

hotel ruin
a chime of finches
in the rafters

a butterfly
cupped in her hands
hibiscus sunset

embroidered hedgerows
the yellow scent
of summer

forest trail
the evening closely follows
the winter sun

afternoon drizzle
a clear sky in the puddle
below the swing

evening rain
hillside shadows
running off

hailstones
do i live
a little longer?

passing train
strobe light of the setting sun
on the hedges

evening breeze
pigeons swing and balance
on a loose cable

night fishing
moonlight escapes
through net holes

fall
the slight pause in between
each step

november
what the dark clouds hide
in their wombs

first rain
somewhere a peacock
unfurls its feathers

the bulbuls continue
their practice
morning raga

long drive
scent of fresh tea breaks
the mist

paddy fields
the unheard steps
of a heron

dusk
the clouds steal
some orange

across the roof shingles
sunset

of the swallow's wing
paper cut

the squeal of a rusted
clothesline

the peregrine scatters
the street pigeons

hangman
the snapped branch
of the silver birch

potholes
the pigeon dips its head
to drink

burlap
shrouding the rosebushes
twilight

still in the rain
under one umbrella
this dog and i

carrying the weight
of a lark's song

monsoon night
the restless strokes of
her paintbrush

spring cleaning
dusting the cobwebs
from my shadow

a fishing net catches
the first light

pebble moon
a patchwork quilt of
stray dreams

a parasol leans into
its own shadow

home away from home
someone else's
green mountains

late blooming sasanqua
only one sister
remains

blue afternoon
on your hands the scent
of eucalyptus

the breeze
through the bower vine
turning blush pink

mistaking
someone else for you
rabbit ear iris

butterfly crossing
wild blue phlox

gossiping
over the back fence
trumpet vines

mountain haze
the remains of my dream
in fading blossoms

the glow
of spring eventide
daffodil sunset

spring sunlight

cast into shadows

the wind curls
with a wave
daylight folding

into the blue
a white swan
rising

bells chime
from the monastery
evening stillness

a boat sails past
the picture frame

the boy leaves behind
an unfinished sky

the moon crosses the river
on my left

at airport parking

the sea unseals
a thousand puddles

puppies strive to reach
the winter sun

a palette for
the horizon

the frogs croak
at the sight of it

flight of cranes
shooting stars
at noon

sun tags along with
the banyan roots

jasmine blossoms
the farmer returns with
fishy dreams

soft drizzle
scent of old books
in father's room

spring breeze
the sand unsettles
empty shells

the slow climb
of turtles

the dip and rise
of memory

off the grid
the mathematics
of flowers

orion's belt
tracing the scar across
your cheek

the slickness
of the otter's back
night rain

the crescent moon
of the hummingbird
a flower opens

somewhere
in my bones
a cricket

cascading
down the mountain
moonbeams

winter mist
so softly the cat jumps
upon the ledge

sculpting the dark
under an old banyan
cicada song

stitching the ends
of a cerulean sky
darting swallows

c section
a lark hatchling beaks
the full moon

an ocean
within the raindrop
raven sky

the ballerina held up
with band-aids

in the dark kelp
wrack the shadow
self

on silver lake
another bare branch bends
to complete itself

twisting in the wind
no one's favorite

from both sides
of the border

in a crow’s cry

before dawn

crouching
in the storm

and retreats

above the snow

and finding it

against the frost

at the wind

where will you be
when i get old

among new lilies
she waters
the stone buddha

why should a fiddlehead
become a fern

and coconut oil

all day long

after midnight

for a moment
we share the same path

of goldeneyes

forsaken

in the tall grass

mid-winter
the heart of sweetbox
thru an open gate

their steam thickens
the valley mist

winter meadow
a doe blows warmth
into the dawn

banyan roots
braiding the darkness
with light

sculpted
by the loon's call

in its roots

the gerberas
in bloom

after the storm
the wind chimes
realigning

under the rock

riding down the escalator
the scent of snow
on damp coats

autumn wishes
leaves fall into the well

grandpa's tales
lightning grazes the
tobacco patch

eternity before
the trembling leaf
tomorrow

autumn plum shadows
moonlight
across her face

broken twigs
short end of wishbones
among the tombstones

waking to the sound
of dali watches

passing cumulus
kite for the
beggar's wind

not knowing
if we can take care of her
the sea the sea

setting gibbous moon
a golden jellyfish drifts
under our kayak

mouth organ lamentations
drifting down the coast
road fog

christmas morning
leading me at low tide
over quick sand

low spring tide
the rocks i haven't seen
since the tsunami

between them

on fire

rolls over

around itself

on kauai

taking
the blue notes higher

in a broken egg
the imperfect sky

of the express train
i uncurl my toes

within themselves

in your hair

of my youth

judging the cloud's thickness
by the day's darkness

of a boy i thought i loved

bending to the weight
of the weather

into the sky

beside buckets of apples
apples in the grass

so suddenly
chrysanthemums bloom

a pelican turns
dives and surfaces
crescent moon

the hummingbird’s small song
wakes me

hugging the contours
of stones
moonlit ripples

pass into evening
mum's lace curtains

leaving the hedge
in a flutter

distant sheep
grazing in the sky

in the wooden buddha

into the clouds

collide in midair

at twilight

of a cormorant

and closer

in dappled shade
dappled light

forty years ago

on his marker

of a
tulip

in an empty cicada shell

among the poplars

where there were songs

of their dog's tongue

over the telephone

of each branch

with me

of tent

out of the blue

in the ice
in my glass

darkens

the gray clack
where the rails join

we begin to think
of home

in the forest dark
the light her hands offer

on the cold wind
winter seclusion

rasp
of the fox's rut cry
midwinter

drawing near

from afar

to nowhere

in the mouths
of sand-strewn clams
delta blues

i fill my flask
with moonlight

of a red-winged blackbird

her natural sense
of rhythm

from her child's finger

stirs the twilight

hoofprints in the dark
the bolted horse
slows to a trot

sunset over
neither of us wishes
to speak first

spring sale
the mannequin stripped
by the wind

late summer
a firefly goes
to ground

after camping
the one flat spot

dead of winter
i was where i am
when the snow began

brief tremor
the bonsai nods
and nods

dawn
and still a few shadows
in the bed

empty
now my garden blooms
with stars

black throated wind
a junkyard dog
charges the gate

bitter morning
i wrap myself
in a wildflower

the poker player
twists his ring
starry night

falling through
a metal net
city moon

into the distance
the cafe car barista's
cinnamon eyes

origami
the folds
in a beggar's blanket

pumping gas
a sparrow pecks dead bugs
off the front bumper

warm winter rain
the beach and i
collecting sea glass

riding on owl wings
the stars above the stars

buddha's birthday
goldfinches mating
on a mailbox

anniversary
of my father's death
leaves falling off a mountain

watching
the street darken
thin november rain

sudden left-hand turn
the eye-blink of
a dogwood blossom

afternoon rain
the bus driver's rhythmic tap
on the fare machine

fog-shrouded windows
the train commuters
turn inward

a cloud of birds
this way and that
november rain

storm's end
the leaf cup
full of light

eventide
crows find the last piece
of blue sky

afternoon crow calls
glimpse of winter sky
from my hospital bed

yellow smudged moon
scent of hoya flower
in the empty room

after the red tide
the closed clam flat
reopened

waiting room
spending time
with a clock

sundown
sedimentary rock turns back
into a lizard

autumn sunset
salmon in the smoker

on the edge of town
an outfield
keeps on going

winter wind
its weight on
woodsmoke

all these funerals lately
my lasagna

winter solstice
a robin queries
the silence

between cupped hands
air
and a crane fly

snow-covered buddleia
the shapes
of old dreams

beyond the horizon
a tractor
ploughing the sky

graduation day
cool breeze stirring
gowns and leaves

wind turbine
looming ripe wheat

formless garden
the scent of
dark snow

awake
while the whole world sleeps
the small light of stars

summer dusk
a bee can't leave
the lavender

a firefly lit
by the bat's wing
night heat

in the glass
of cheap red
sun

summer night
she smells faintly
of fire

a young snake hides
in short grass
i've become kind

will pay anything
the medal collector
who missed the war

starving
the darkness

no groundhog
a mars rover photographs
its own shadow

valentine's
an extra scoop
for the litterbox

inlaws coming
the dog knows how
to play dead

the silence
between
languages

the members list
dead poets remain
in good standing

snow mold
a magpie picks through
last year's trash

white hairs twisted
to the fireweed's stem
autumn wind

low hanging clouds
wiping the dust from my shoes

first frost
trapped in the oak's shadow
the rising sun

snow melt
the barn owl
glides across the moon

pounding tent pegs
at midnight
late-season rain

first day of spring
the riverboat trapped in ice

behind the dead willow
the white blossoms
of a dogwood

on the cliff edge
my folding chair
unfolds

in the blackness of night
the sweet perfume
of a winter camellia

city at dawn
a cacophony
of voices

on the underbelly
of the falcon
the dawn's pink light

hawks in flight
shadows cross
the midday sun

years later
she polishes the silver
with his toupee

rain
runs through the hills
a harpsichord

dark windows
abandoned saints
of central london

thinking of throwing it away
i crack and fry up the full moon

morning escapes
through newly empty air
acorns

reluctant to hyphenate
the clouds of august

folds of a dress
in an old painting
the southern hills

a stone
in the tire tread
daffodils

the sound of nylon
as she crosses her legs
waiting for snow

the scritch
of small claws in the ceiling
smells like rain

the flaw
in the afghan pattern
christmas rush

in the snow
footprints going away
her last gift

page 46
adding to the mystery
a squashed moth

spring prom
asking dad for advice
on garter belts

deep snow
the calls of migrating thrushes
far overhead

after the storm
the sound of chainsaws
in the forest

river flowing
the song of the dipper

night rain
neon lights flash
in puddles

heat haze
the call of doves
from the oaks

spring breezes
the changed way
that sound carries

strobe lights
in the underground nightclub
my nettle stung arm

cloudless morning
she chooses a deeper
shade of blue

swans on the lake
my daughter fidgets
with her tutu

antique book shop
the sales assistant
reads my lips

ghost story
the little ones add
their voices

warm sand
we leave our impressions
behind

war memorial steps
a gang of skinheads
blowing smoke rings

a humpback's song
father fiddles
with his hearing aid

palm reader's eyelashes
my fortune in a hat pin

wall portraits
i begin my yoga count
from the top

turtle pond
a girl shares unshelled
peanuts

first stanza
the missing subject
is a snail

adrift
in a fishbowl
stray moon

what if
beneath footfalls
an egg laid

always
a raindrop hangs on her gaze
black-eyed susan

sounds of life
tinkling bells
and a snoring dog

afternoon sun
light haloes
his hair

dawn
a swarm of bats
dives into my chimney

behind the nun's smile
a glimpse
of black teeth

dusk
moths doze
on my window

thunderclap!
the hawk drops
his rabbit

moving day
my parrot flies
from my shoulder

in the mouth of an orchid daylight
at the dead end

the scent of old books
overpacked
for the afterlife

the crunch of tobiko a twenty
in the gutter

raccoons
also fighting
in the dark

clouds cling
to the mountain
stories you try to forget

black grapes ripen
where odysseus rested

hide and seek
the harvest moon chooses
a neighbor's gingko

bare hedge
banked with snow
i accept

humidity
further warping
the dali watches

night ride
the moon and i
stand still

cool nights
the morning glory's
delicate purple

pop-up fly
briefly the sky
has two moons

layers of skin
on the gas nozzle
freezing wind

frost sparkles
on the pavement
starry night

frosty fields
black sheep eat
discarded turnips

edged in frost
the last leaves still hang
on the copper beech

darkness falls
a black dog crouches
by the fireside

fading in and out
of the overcast sky
crescent moon

urban canal
a mute swan swims across
reflected houses

snow piled
between silver birches
a fox barks

bonfire night
i press my finger
against her lips

emperor penguins
a toddler shuffles
towards the glass

chinese acrobats
her unborn child
changes position

slave museum
the rattle of my keychain
breaks the silence

day's end
my daughter asks
for the moon

a few snowflakes
the exchange students
stop in their tracks

nana's wardrobe
no lions or witches
behind her coats

brittle to my touch
an old moon

cold sheen
in the raised chalice
her wet mumblings

empty birdhouse
i check my voice mail
in gray light

as needed to plumb
the darkness night dew

red lobster
her prying glance
through the mist

snowfall
in a cup
the hush

swing
twisting by itself
wreathed school yard

while whistling for my dog
a mockingbird
whistles back

dusk
silver light
shrouds the magnolia tree

midnight
lightning thunders
into my sleep

when looking at me
i wonder if the old dog
sees an old human

dawn
a sudden beating of wings
against my window

after the funeral
a blue moon
against a silver sky

sword practice
even the bees
stay away

never a bookmark
when you need
one shooting star

after the dive
not enough salt
in my soup

from the canoe
pointing out every turtle
at first

spring
my wish
not to wish

dust
in a beam of light
this bride to be

october
what flowers are left
lie down

the newscaster's hands
gathering clouds

arthritis
the first tips of green
in dark soil

only
the shocking sound
of the bug zapper

twilight
breaking the mirror surface
a loon

the rose
losing its blush
at dusk

thanksgiving
huddled on cold asphalt
gulls with no necks

a glow
through the nylon tent
full moon

early morning
the housefly and i
rub our eyes

evening rain
a saxophonist plays
in the underpass

low sun
shadow crows chase each other
across the walls

lightning
in the orchard
scent of apples

insomnia
the rattle of rain
on the window

urban rainbow
the factory chimneys
glow gold

dark clouds
on the mountains
my bruised knees

last waltz
a swirl of autumn leaves
outside the window

30000 feet
a reminder of home
in the pilot's voice

winter stars
my son trips over
his rocket

a heron
knee-deep in the stream
i adopt the same pose

plum blossoms
we pick up his ashes

low tide
a band of surfers
compare scars

birthing pool
my hand skims
the surface

dad's house
i unbutton a shirt
that no longer fits

because it's your turn
autumn rain

tideline
the calculated risks
of dreaming

cloud shapes
the turns we make
in secret

summing up the stars
fallen leaves

late night special
the postman rings
a broken bell

chill
a brick tile
cuts across
clouds

carapace
the strand of emptiness
i tuck away

evening meditation
i follow the rhythm
of the old dog's breath

misty morning
a shadow flies
across my skylight

among new saplings
the armadillo
finds his roots

the old dog yawns
a ladybug
escapes to the light

florida spring
the brown chameleon
turns green

night rain
a spider's lacey web
twists in the wind

evening
the old dog's breakfast
still untouched

more cold rain
my nails still too long

spelling
cumulonimbus with my toe
long grass

the colors in a pile
of crushed cars
autumn

she turns away from me
a floor above the moon

the name
i call you at night
white blossoms

a gull drops a crab and
the heat

shadows in the carpet
little skulls of summer

her contours
softened by lake water
mosquitoes

picnic
using the blanket
as an umbrella

evening tea
the gingko sheds its leaves
in minutes

summer holidays
comparing bruises
after the rock fight

watch repair
all the clocks still set
to standard time

you
in the soft rain
iced tea

libra
this tiny expression
of our dna

a picnic
under the cherry trees
waiting for blossoms

evening blackbird-song
the flautist stops playing
to listen

the neighbors' cat
no longer on their doorstep
fading roses

in the ash
at the bonfire site
a new lace bra

old railway tunnel
still hearing the sound
of birdsong

birthday morning
the cat lays a mouse
on my pillow

gray heron
roosting in a pine tree
daytime moon

wolf chorus
all of us
join in

snowflakes
i ball up a pair
of odd socks

walking
to where the ball stopped
rolling thunder

lobster moon
she pulls me back
into the hot tub

crow caw
i stretch my arms
into the wind

hotel entrance
we re-examine
the stars

morning stroll
i close my eyes
to hear the sea

driftwood
the strange scent
of sunrise

rumored dawn
a crow's cawing
rises

smoke rings
an eagle curling
its wings

cloud peaks
tilting on cliffs
heron's wings

summer rain
on the clothes line
down feathers

moving day
distant chimes rattle
in the breeze

vespers
the chipped pout
of a stone angel

vernal equinox
opening all the windows
to bird song

falling into sleep
on my folded hands
spring moonlight

new year's day
the light shining on
empty branches

the cactus garden
stiller than ever
winter clouds

a tiny branch
the hummingbird keeps time
to summer rain

light fills
only the topmost leaves
hint of autumn

the small buddha
leaning to the side
winter rain

the pepper plant's
gnarled fingers
first autumn chill

pond ripple
a goose lifts its wings
toward the sky

approaching winter
the christmas cactus
at half mast

harvest time
the gleam
of freshly sheared wheat

monkey puzzle
trapped in the heart
of the garden maze

sun-dappled path
the grasshopper visits
every leaf

ducks sleeping
beneath the breakwater
autumn leaves

in my teabowl
this morning's
thunderclouds

smoke from grass fires
fills the sky
plumes of pampas

waiting for
the kettle to boil
bird song

sound of the wind
through dead leaves
bird song at dusk

pale sun flickers
across the buddha's face
pulse of crickets

forest hike
a smear of gnats
on my chapstick

beachcombers
the sea takes back
all their discards

after the storm
the stillness
before the frog

a shock
of blackbirds
scattering daisies

the day's heat
rising
cricket by cricket

puddle
just big enough
to hold the sun

the cry of a nightbird
how slowly a rose opens
in darkness

harvest moon
in the loneliness
between owls

feeding koi
by the pond
a broken butterfly

wedding
in the garden
mosquitoes

i watched snow
fall here
dragonflies

the comfort
of being together
a sandwich

dust swirls
behind the car
my old bike

trays of canapes
at the picnic
crows

welcome mat
yellow lilies
by the door

mountains
misted with heat
beach party

roads not taken
the shifting shadows
of summer clouds

last kiss of summer
the sweet flesh
of a plum

whispered secrets
the mist
absorbs the night

prayers of remembrance
cranes
folded in our hands

long summer night
pale through the fire
the rising sun

house sale
we bury
the hamsters' headstones

closing the church
the angel wing
of an approaching storm

a pile of cones
beneath the pine
waning moon

new coolness
an empty snail shell
under the heather

windless night
the steady cadence
of chirping frogs

melting shadows
waiting our turn
at the ice cream counter

lamb's ear
the softness
of summer rain

lifting clouds
a yellow monarch
heralds the sun

wisteria petals
our voices adrift
on the breeze

flower garden
the mantis turns back
into a stem

summer breeze
the shapes of clouds
reshaping

forest trail
the sunlight dapples
a horse's flank

mossy stone
the wheelchair
gathers rust

work day's end
the chimney smoke curls
between raindrops

out of sheep
i turn to counting
the raindrops

still lake
the rising sun
splits in two

departing spring
a nest of hair
in my hairbrush

white moth
tangled in a web
queen anne's lace

summer's end
crows claim
the adirondack chairs

get-well card
gold glitter spackles
his hospital gown

last breath of fish
in the seagull's beak
broken sand dollars

cocktail hour
honeybees buzz
the tips of the mint

slicing lemons
at the kitchen sink
summer heat

first sunflower
a little boy fences
with the moon

evening jam
a banjo picks
through the wind

only one cloud
stained with sunset

dipping a beak
in evening's white breath
bluebird

coyote tracks
in the sand

violin sonata
the shape
of a cirrus cloud

riding ripples
of the moon
a swan

snow-storm
the smell
of hot chilli

on the swings
a magpie swaggers

first frost
the hum
of the furnace

shoots the puck

evensong

rose petals
on wet earth
footprints

my grandson takes
his first steps

hurricane
i lean against
the wind

last summer sunset
gulls circling
the sun

carousel horses
the young widow changes
her name

my niece tracks fairies
the silver trails
of snails

family dinner
so many forms
of silence

winter morning
the stillness
of your face

the brush
of an old lover's lips
autumn mist

white feather
our sandcastle surrenders
to the tide

blackberries
on every trail
summer morning

day moon
sparrows warming up
their voices

the cling
of spider silk
lingering heat

lazy afternoon
the slow circles
of a redtail hawk

moonlit orchard
deer up to their necks
in fruit

blue lobelia
a hummingbird sips
the morning stillness

mosquito's buzz
a fish leaps
through the crescent moon

summer breeze
the dandelion raises
its bald head

planting season
the farmer stitches
a scarecrow's face

summer breeze
the pheasant's tail
into the reeds

lightning flash
the dog's silhouette
also trembles

vanity mirror
a butterfly lands
on its reflection

teapot's whistle
the birdsong outside
changes pitch

thatched roof
from the hollow eaves
cricket sounds

the mottled rock
lifts from the river
night heron

leaving the zendo
after meditation
he swats the mosquito

last day of summer
the whole neighborhood
smells of new-mown grass

remembering
the costa rican sun
clink of ice cubes

hazy autumn moon
i sleep between sheets
of wild roses

by the fire hydrant
a single hollyhock
spilling its seeds

waning moon
a pile of ladybugs
waits for summer

late afternoon
even the blackbird
is golden

last dogwood blossom
a butterfly rests
on the old dog's tail

white to dark to white
a flock of ibis turning
the sun

at the burial
grief pauses
for the mockingbird

the baby's smile
on and off and on
first fireflies

in the seeds
of a dandelion
the shape of the wind

shooting range
leaves crackle
underfoot

two women
hold hands
wild-rose hedge

fireworks
beyond the mountain
full moon

late summer
the old farm mailbox
under brambles

table tennis

both win

heavy rain
both cats
in the armchair

our old home
someone else’s cat
in the window

summer evening
the long secrets
of our shadows

a brief pause
at the kissing gate

your birthday cake
twenty years
of the same candles

thin and graceful
the bending reeds
the laughing girls

we choose
tofu

a weekend traffic jam
of ducklings

the garden yields
your son's red ball

white crayon
the maple’s branches
outlined in snow

of crashing waves

my shadow melts
into me

snow
in the valley
the lowering sky

purple magnolias
lingering
twilight

daisy petals
spring arrives
robin by robin

the zigzag path
of the moon

a beehive
in progress

the kite's string
pulls taut

for the houseplants
i buy new pots

summer heat
the ant carries only
its shadow

class reunion
everyone else's
ring fingers

canyon
my echo also
speechless

rising tide
the bottled message
back out to sea

flattened on the road
a spill of peacock feathers
winter rain

three crows
dive-bombing a hawk
the contrail's steady course

curled up with the cat
dusk takes over
the catalpa leaves

scuffling through leaves
i compose a letter
to my dead father

this morning autumn
in the husks
of sunflowers

pastel pink
the canal
pulses with petals

no trace
of summer heat
sparrows at twilight

mountain evening
a quiet whiteness
swallowing the raven

winter forest
the soft green of spring
breaking the silence

first cup of tea
a squirrel nibbles
a patch of sun

first light
the city sound rising
with the sun

sunset
the heron steps out
of his shadow

with each lightning flash
the dogwood blooms

of black and white

but the mist

on the beach
end of summer

early dusk
baby too tired
to sleep

cherry tree
in full bloom
grandpa's hair

frost sliding
on glass

piled clouds
gulls scream
over refuse

the tide withdraws
over gravel
castanets

cherry blossoms
i let your cold hand
fall

midwinter
all the warmth of the world
in this tent

night market
the bass flexes its back
toward the sea

the next morning
in the gutter
one red shoe

arms flung wide
the laundry
surrenders to the wind

bookshop
i lose myself
in someone else's dreams

the old oak's death
we close the summer house
for the last time

old-growth forest
pausing
for a banana slug

morning walk
weaving in and out
of sunlight

evening solitude
the mountain lake
deeper than starlight

grandma's ring
on my finger
trailing roses

waking
to the hum of the furnace
winter dawn

cormorants gather
in the dusk

gingko leaves
brush the sky

the sound of snow
on snow

capsizes

out in the cornfield
stalks bending

somebody else's
new year's kiss

the bicycle's
single track

the cameraman's
long shadow

the maple's reflection
redder than the tree

in the back of her pickup

a hundred ways
to say i love you
origami dragons

in the pine's limbs
vernal equinox

november sweetgums
her colorful language

haloed lights
in a snow-covered parking lot
hometown visit

on the koi pond bridge

iceblink
the rhythm of the ship
keeping time

ibis etched
in evening light
rising tide

calving iceberg

than the sky

through my window
the shadows of
sea birds

an albatross dips
below the waves
gale force swell

splintering brash ice
the whale's steady breath

changing seasons
behind the maple
her red dress falls

all the way
around the oak tree
no squirrel

silence
a woodpecker
breaks through

bare feet
meet the welcome mat
spring mud

cherry smoke
on the mantel nail
her white dress

starlight
the summer grass
still warm

a chinese box
inside
a chinese box

suicide moon
the sharp edge
of the icicle

summer concert
the thunderhead swells
to crescendo

3 am
a telephone rings
in a dream

knife wind
my white breath
stolen

chance of snow
my son asks why
i never smile

blue horizon
the cold precision
of a hawk's cry

full bloom
full stop

vernal equinox
drops of ice bind
first buds

long distance call
the friend's voice
from yesterday

quiet evening
the tap and memories
leaking

spring melt
a sheet of snow
punched with crocuses

winter's close
instead of snowfalls
snowdrops

fetters of winter
a wire mesh fence
sealed with rime

return of the light
an old bull calling
to the mountains

again
circling the willow
this lone hawk

morning star
waking before
the dandelions

summer cloud
he brings me
a hawk's feather

first thunder
the echo of
a peacock's cry

mid-summer storm
a herd of dairy cows
huddle together

sleepless night
between the moon and i
only the willow

winter rain
dress rehearsal
at the black piano

flurries
the scent of wood smoke
in the wind

waiting for midnight
the fire working its way
through the log

humid night
between notes
the rasp of cello strings

beside the graveyard
train parked
on the tracks

autumn field
the glint of sunlight
on a railroad track

lavender sunset
stopping to smell
the neighbor's lilac bush

hospital window
the traffic at both ends
of the day

bees in the mist
the foxglove
humming

deep snow
sleeping to the sound
of white noise

winter solitude
graveyard headstones
back to back

day drizzle
scrubbing the rainbow
inside the pot

thin winter air
the hair left behind
in her brush

forgotten frost
we no longer make
snow angels

laughing
as i chase my hat
spring wind

all day long
this rain this rain this rain
april moon

watching the sunrise
rose garden

her body
laced in black silk
midnight

first warm day
the melancholy face
of the tv dials

long walk
down a short road
green moon

toes in the river
spring turtles

still
two or three crows
corn stubble

dark lighthouse
beyond the breakers
ghost sails

country road
we exhale
the milky way

snow on the unmarked grave
deeper

ripening sky
another slow turn
of the cider press

wildflowers
a blind man stops
to listen

new neighbor
a dragonfly enters
my house of cards

falling star
the gap between a wish
and wishful thinking

low clouds
the power plant's chimney
scrapes the sky

window table
a beggar's and my
t | here

deep winter
the hot scent of lavender
fills the sauna

sleet
on the playground
emptiness

on and on
a small boy tries to hold
fresh snow

house hunting
she times the walk
to the beach

cold moon
still the weight of her baby
in my arms

dial-up
the soft rain
of dandelion clocks

between the rattle
of gum-tree bark
a magpie's nest

moving day
inside this matchbox
a cicada shell

afternoon rest
where the willow and the fence
meet in shadow

late this year
the cherry tree
turning into autumn

clover bent forward
the bumblebee's weight

one white goose
in the pond
melting snow

even in darkness
their presence
snow-covered peaks

noticing every
twig
first snow

autumn sunset
in the brown field
a red tractor

holly bush
without berries
the cardinals flirting

no moon
the snow lighting
the way

evening fog
blackbirds switching
power lines

blossom drifts
up to her knees
in pink

taking her coffee
with morning frost
lunar eclipse

steady rain
the old chevy
up on blocks

morning haze
the voice from the dash
relocating

one large maple
his yellow raincoat
in the picture

bell ringer
donating the jingle
in my pocket

where i left
my shovel
only snow

purple sky
the jumbled geese
unjumble

curve of her shoulder
evening stroll

a helicopter
hangs in the air
city heat

thunder
the stray dog
bolts

snap peas
a stress ball rolls
past my cubicle

indy 500
my grandpa
fast asleep

sick bed
from an open window
the sea

dejà vu
eating the plums
from the ice box

lulled back
into dream
cicadas

fortune''s turn
beneath the desert moon
snake eyes

this winter night
slowly unfolding
first star

autumn colors
the changing shape
of the mountain

total eclipse
spade by spade
a gardener turns
the earth

crossroad at night
virgin snow reflects
the flashing amber light

a pair of glowing eyes
out of the night fog

mozart's requiem
the moment all the choristers
turn the page

it's been a long time since we
it's already autumn here
lonely evening

deep autumn
the half-naked birch
fully yellow

gossamer threads
a solitary oak
cocooned in light

full moon tonight
he snores louder

spring tide
a layer of dust
on the condom packet

celebrating
the tulips too
this line of ants

blood
on the hospital sheets
sunrise

friday's dusk
he brings home
dark chocolate

first spring day
this breeze
her hair

white sky
i burrow down deeper
into the bedsheets

winter storm
the unlit fireplace
filled with wind

indian summer
a brown leaf drifts into
the open window

all the cherry trees
in bloom
her pink umbrella

waltz at dusk
in the audience
the old couple link arms

overcast day
the lamp posts
filled with snow

cellos in unison
nightfall

keeping secrets
autumn mist
above the fields

evening darkness
unlacing the spider web
thread by thread

hunters moon
the pigeons perched
on clay shingles

acorns dropping
his cane barely
taps the ground

dragonfly
the illusion
of bare sky

condolences
i choose the card
without words

wild yarrow
the grass trapped
under my feet

enough space
between crows
autumn sun

only one of us
comfortable
june funeral

morning fog
settling in
at the wrong cubicle

lazy dusk
the cat's stretch
touches mine

far-off owl
the phantom scent
of father's pipe

yet another bug
buzzes the zapper
whiskey moon

trail loop
no difference between
the pond and the rain

early light
patching up the holes
in my story

one face
then the other
falling leaf

cirrus clouds
her fingers barely touch
the piano keys

her wry smile
in old photographs
crescent moon

the farmer's old scythe
a harvest
of rust

morning fog
the distance
between boat and shore

fresh snow
the labyrinth's
new path

in silence
firelight fills
two wine glasses

midwinter
the snowman's nose
half-pecked

hot cocoa
a jetliner crosses
the milky way

forest brook
the red beech trees drift away
leaf after leaf

drizzly field
the rattle of a tractor
wades in the fog

autumnal equinox
a leafless persimmon tree
full of fruit

orchard cleaning
the smoke of burning leaves
among bare limbs

under cherry trees
he eats fish n' chips
from a newspaper

dream speak
sunlight on the opening
tulip's tips

winter streets
the steam rising off
roasted chestnuts

the night he left
the many sounds
of summer rain

cutting
the last rose stem
woodsmoke

spring cleaning
the rhythmic sound of her
sharpening pencils

cherry blossoms
the bride-to-be offers
a sun-kissed cheek

new year
bare branches
full of seed pods

thunderclouds
ravens wait
along the road

rising moon
in the orchestra
one black violin

flags at half mast
the temperature dropping

purple lightning
irises
in bloom

the color
of september leaves
evening sun

windswept night
the erratic songs
of crickets

father's day
his wheel tracks
in the carpet

drifting clouds
the old folks
sipping wine

storm watch
the black wick
of the candle

a rainbow in one
of the chandelier crystals
spring rain

the fat cat
sits halfway home
squash blossoms

mayfly season
the bird untangles
the worm

summer evening
looking for the stars
that fell

flute concert
the old man's fingers
play along

fireworks
at twilight a field
of daisies

doctor's office
the rain gutter
also leaks

late comer
to the outdoor concert
the neighbor's dog

pine slabs
dovetailing together
carpenter's hands

each year
lower on the neighbor's tree
fireworks

sun down
sliding between redwoods
flute notes

raspberries
frozen to the vine
winter moon

wading through snow
the cry
of a stranded goose

a single leaf
in my bike basket
autumn wind

almost twilight
tree full of lanterns

switchback
alpine aster
all in bloom

summer storm
the uneven rhythm
of wind chimes

snow mould
under every fallen leaf
spring opening

a pine cone
on thoreau's grave
october rain

butt cheek moon
the pumpkin turns
under my knife

whispering
the darkness between
fireflies

cold snap
the sharp bite
of a radish

autumn light
sinking into moss

the stillness
of the carousel
morning mist

scarecrow
birds
anyway

summer fling
strands of twine
litter the hayloft floor

geese on the wing
bending both arms
around a pumpkin

thistle down
a cursory kiss
before bed

flea market
a monkey's paw
under glass

a drawn-out shake
wrings the river
from the dog

firefly night
sharing the sway
of a porch swing

emptying the grass box
scents of bygone summers

of mice and men
blackberries rusting
on the vine

empty chrysalis
trying to remember
last night's dream

mehndi
from wrists to fingertips
last of the swallows

sparsh-swars
from the sitar
jasmine breeze

testing the water
through rings of raindrops
the egret's steps

midsummer night's dream
slipping the punt
from its moorings

writing a list
for a black garden
starling song

banging about
inside my ribs
cherry blossom

clipping the hedge 
a butterfly escapes

among the plastic bags
the plover's yellow head

stormlight
the magnolia
bursts into flower

the old hurts
resurfacing
bluebell sky

larkspur
on the calendar
another anniversary

thunder claps
rolling away
to a grumble

roadside lilies
facing west
a deeper orange

full moon
on my neighbor's porch
a new light

day's end
disappearing footprints
at the water's edge

alone at dusk
waiting for the company
of fireflies

rain wet grass
all the windows and doors
thrown open

sluggish morning
the bedroom fan
begins to squeak

opening a window
to hear the cicadas
continuing

box turtle
stepping from mud
to mud

just before
it disappears
twilight

woodsmoke
the milky way drifts between
now and then

spring rain
the lips and throat
of the iris

commencement
chasing a new generation
of fireflies

in the corner
of the war memorial
a new spiderweb

on the floor
the wall the ceiling
an ant

feeding time
the mouse's heart thrums
in my hand

snorkeling
sunlight patterns
on white sand

lavender
unclenching
my fists

wet pavement
the texture
of the toad

lingering
in my sleeping bag
campfire smoke

hummingbird
everything else
disappears

rusted gate
clouds open and close
the dandelions

dog days
a single shoe left
at the tide line

moths at dusk
the memory of talc
that grandmother wore

labor day
lifting the weight
of a shell

autumn weeds
the orb spinner's
warp and weft

flea market
a flaxen braid
in a family brooch

tractor pull
the sunburned line
on a farmer's arms

cutting my cloth
according to its width
the wings of swallows

picture window
the cat stretches the breadth
of the sunset

silver lining
the shimmer of rain
in the egret's plume

summer solstice
a damselfly bends
an ear of grass

unfolding
a field map of summer
butterfly

swaying in 
a sky of stars
the hammock

fox scat
a dream curls back
into darkness

closing the biography
the scent of violets

sheep country
shifting the flax bag
to my other hand

feeling it
not feeling it
the grasshopper
between my hands

the sound of a star falling
your arm at my waist

pushing her lips together
to form the sound
frogs

winter sun
the length of time it takes
the sheet-scar to fade

pumpkins in a bin
small hands stroke
the biggest one

fresh cut meadow
the alternating path
of the tractor

storm brewing
an abstract arrangement
of cherry blossoms

beach roses
sweetening the odor
of low tide

afternoon stillness
my neighbor's chimes
announce the breeze

parking garage
nesting pigeons
on each level

seagulls in flight
the sun's reflections
through a wine glass

white crocuses
the first exposed skin

seed starting
a pile of rusted nails
on the workbench

birth pains
all day squirrels
building a nest

purple loosestrife
all the things
i can't get rid of

night rain
the fainter sound
of the ocean

crescent moon
trying on the dress
that never fits

sap rising
three or four gumballs
in my pockets

sunday afternoon
i only pretend
to bait my hook

grandpa's shirt buttons
minnows flashing

morning sun
an empty castle
in a glass bowl

summer storm
we discover
electricity

hazy sunset
the weight
of a ripe peach

monkey cage
a butterfly drifts
in and out

the smell of earth
in the root cellar
tornado warning

indian summer
the drive-in brimming
with cricket song

caterpillar breeze
fledgelings crowd
the birdhouse door

old cemetery
the hemlock stand
at the water's edge

rainbow
a bluebird
feeds its mate

first crush
apple branches
nearly touching

robin song
the fleeting touch
at first base

thunderheads at dusk
the faraway jingle
of an ice cream truck

forget me nots
wishing i knew now
what i did back then

rain in the air
finding the perfume
in every pulse spot

honeymoon lake
tucked away
the mallard's wing

mellowing
the slam dunk of blossoms
through the rusted hoop

open atlas
the continental drift
of clouds

full moon
a pinhole camera
captures the night

greenstick fracture
a moorhen steps
from the reeds

coming round
the last bend
a skylark’s song

deadwater
the slow tilt
of the rowboat

first yellow leaves
blowing across the lake
late-hatch cygnets

dandelion moon
the book i ordered
unopened

butterfly house
we're all
six again

rain and more rain
the welcome mat
begins to sprout

bitter tea
the moon's tongue
lapping

woodland phlox
filling the spaces
between trees

weeding
with each turn of the trowel
another worm

january thaw
the garden exposed
to my dreaming

moon gazing
fogging up the cold window
with my breath

left-over snow
in the juniper's shadow
an old suet cage

cicadas
swelling into summer
dust in the air

sky and pond
newly green willows
nearly touch

between fence slats
the missing names
of flowers

birdsong
close enough
to silence

mud season
what to apologize for
first

willow
leaning over
to touch you

lightning-split oak
what would i be
in another time?

owl's wing
the darkness
darkens

swingset
into
and out of
thin
air

pear blossoms
which one of these houses
was yours?

traffic jam
the honks of
passing geese

he straightens the picture
above the bed

just beyond
where the path ends
a broken compass

snapdragons
the echo of
your laugh

white sky
a cloud of blackbirds
erupts from an oak

abandoned house
sinking into the weeds
a skeleton key

followed by
someone else's dog

unpaid bills
tomatoes left
for the mailman

raccoon tracks
the first boy
that stole my heart

playground swings
dappled memories
of childhood

the way the cow path
rings a hill

autumn cricket
cornstalks scrape
where they touch

a fringe of trees
on the mountain's back
tipping moon

white-tailed sea eagle
a parting
of the ways

hearth light
a touch of my mother
in my shadow

jasmine breeze
the sense that summer
passed me by

the crow's
stone-filled craw
winter sky

the arch
of her foot
feather shedding moon

sunlit frost
my breath on the heels
of a hare

flying ash
from the camp fire
pipistrelles

between tour groups
the garden
just the garden

tropical moon
we shell peanuts
for one another

lashing rain
one by one the lights go out
in the cathedral

record heat
a song thrush beats
against the tomato cage

reading and re-reading
the same sentence
lotus flowers

summer rain
finding chocolate frogs
at the back of the shop

heavy mist
the last leaves fall
in a straight line

first day of school
bobbing on the lake
a new rowboat

leisurely lunch
the bouquet of peonies
drops a petal

flock of black birds
we drive into a shower
of poop

short-cut home
weaving my shadow
through storm-toppled trees

early breakfast
with morning glories
the ticking clock

twilight stroll
my fingers perfumed
with sage

another birthday
a hawk comes to live
in the neighborhood

winter dawn
a coffee cup ring
on the sleeping laptop

first strawberries
i open my mouth
for you

lichen
the places i hid
when i was a child

humming fridge
the quiet thoughts
of a robot

abandoned building site
wildflowers in progress

alternating current
the river
and the moon

working through hamlet
to get to the tempest
autumn rain

the snap
of an apple's skin
autumn first

eagle pellets
at the summit and me
without pockets

dark night
imaginary bears
showing the way

easter morning
a rapture of hawks squalls
beyond the scud

milkweed
in the empty lot
childhood

spring thaw
where a boot trod
the glistering earth

the shriek
of a foreign gull

wind through trees
the whole forest
breathing

ocean waves
the taste of salt
in my margarita

dragonfly wings
like bells
the river's heartsong

liftoff
clouds looking
larger

monsoon
grackle stepping
through raindrops

shivering
pre wedding
flu

sun on my shoulders
pedaling into
the bike's shadow

on the trail
pausing to watch
the heron's stillness

empty nest
we gather kindling
for the fire

dirty snow
her wedding dress
in the resale window

apologies
cutting the bruise
from the apple

building a snowman
with one arm
the veteran

winter storm
the mailbox flag
stays up

sultry evening
the moon's tide
pulls me in

buenos aires tango
at the end of an alley
the big dipper

still life
cezanne's apples more like
warhol's soup cans

cherry blossoms
the thud of textbooks
on the window seat

halloween
witches on brooms
come up the escalator

lost
on the appalachian trail
i murder the map

crows in a pine
moving the dark
from limb to limb

almost lost
in the snow
new-born lambs

snow falls
into a deeper silence
war graves

in the snow
and out of it
snowdrops

icicles
the shepherd whistles
through gritted teeth

icy wind
a shiver
in the blackbird's song

frozen river
he skates a figure 8
around the arches

winter tracks
moonlight rides
the midnight train

red dusk
two snails couple
on my father's grave

dream over
a crow calls me
into another one

fading fury
retiring into
the snow flurries

a belling deer
at dusk solitude's sound

woodland
the silence
of history

winter dawn
still on the fields
the sky's blue

red snow
in front of the door
a kiss

hot winter day
the way silence meets the wind
prayer flags

getting it
after 50 empty pots
i have no green thumb

super bowl sunday
empty lawn chairs
face the golden gate

watching sunlight
dance on
the broken tv

weeping willow
her golden hair
once blew that way

march moving day
looking for something
i never had

false spring
we argue over which
song is our song

winter dawn
the long shadow
cast by a dust bunny

spent casing
an old man
whistles

mid-winter
the shadow of snow
on snow

tossing and turning
the potter
unable to sleep

swaths of grass
curl across the yard
first snowman

pitch black
the whistle
has no train

old girlfriend
passing each other notes
on facebook

loblolly spring
even the black lab
turns yellow

first freeze
brushing frost
from the pansies' faces

sanguine moon
the jackolantern faces
show their age

she spits further
watermelon seeds

autumn winds
campaign signs
shifting positions

dining el fresco
above us a spider
readies her meal

in the courtyard
two haijin
weighing words

shabbat dinner
the challah loaf
tied in a knot

a blanket of snow
dad's snoring
from upstairs

deep in the arms
of a rocking chair
baby teeth marks

afternoon hike
a spider crawls out
of his beard

his oil paintings
so unlike mine
passion fruit

new year's sun
a koi gulps
below the ice

a gull's shriek
rips right through me
abandoned beach

winter cove
an incoming wave
reshapes the snowline

finding gaps
between the old man's ribs
icy wind

morning frost
the crispness
of the salesman's shirt

falling snow
hands of theatre-goers
warm with applause

sleet
the wind-chime's
unfamiliar tune

whitening
the heads of rusty nails
hoarfrost

his taxi
going nowhere
london snow

snow flurry
on an empty street
the traffic light turns red

the house
of my heritage
dragonflies

memories
this winter night turns into
memory

forsaken
an apple
in november
rain

medieval city
a construction crane
touches the sky

twilight
the silver statue of a man
i don't know

my past
in the orchard
october wind

christmas morning
the gift
of silence

waving as i pass
the north pole
santa's blank stare

still alive
but not blooming
the condolence bush

rain off the gutter
i could never
carry a tune

50 years slip away
lacing up
old skates

first the stem
then the leaves
dying orchid

winter walk
after the rain
shiny pennies

letting go
the fish
i dream of catching

puffy clouds
sleeping under
the stars

awkwardly
down the aisle
averting eyes

rocky coast
the jagged sound
of water

voices of fishermen
caught between waves

goblet
the shape of the
glassblower's breath

branch by branch
a squirrel climbs
the oak's shadow

no rain
minnow's silver bellies
rubbing rock

in the slope
of the hammock
crescent moon

crowded parking lot
a dragonfly searches
for a spot

scolding the squirrel
that scolds me
replanting bulbs

new home
another child's handprints
in the driveway

into the oak's reflection
an acorn falls
creek circles

going nowhere
a bit of fluff
in the pine branch

woods
a fox emerges
from the moon

front porch
autumn arrives
in a box of persimmons

mayan ruins
the hum of insects
by the coke stand

autumn rain
leaves cover
the dog's grave

outdoor artist
the color of the dog
beside him

old pier
boats in the marina
moaning

christmas day
the tinkle of bells
on the pub door

whiter
than grandma's hair
mistletoe berries

first cold
the aroma of mother's
chicken soup

she ices
the christmas cake
first snow

ping
a sycamore seed whirls
into the wind-chime

morning frost
lifting white socks higher
the neighbor's cat

maple leaves
fall on maple leaves
a deeper red

scattered leaves
fly back into the tree
goldfinches

the big ease
of the milky way

the city's
mania

my way home
between stars

dense snowfall
the world's
white shadow

a waltzing
museum shop

summer dusk
the sound of high heels
from the backyard

small talk
the solitude
in our i

returning
from a long walk
someone stole my shade

first raindrops
an inaudible voice
on the answering machine

now you see it
now you don't
spider silk in the wind

winter park bench
a stranger and i share
the same groan

december dusk
i will never visit
my grandparents' birthplace

november sunshine
squishing my way across
the park green

november wind
carrying off more
than her letter

gathered up
by a cloud
harvest moon

shadow
the lighthouse throws
on the rocks

winter thaw
the river on top
of the river

connecting the dots
i make her
a constellation

sunrise
performing what i imagine
tai chi to be

kayaking on brackish water
some of this some of that

mud flat
tide pool
in an old tire

following embers
into the night sky
shooting star

long road trip
orion's belt rests
on the dashboard

clear cut mountainside
the split-rail fence
dividing      nothing

tadpoles swimming
in a mason jar
when will you change?

not getting the whole story
this ladybug
on my page

beneath bitterweed
a fawn's
last breath

harvest moon
butter puddling
in the acorn squash

garage sale
the smell of old age
in her hand-me-downs

honeysuckle
bees bumping
into the trees

awakened
the snoring
of the cat

pumpkin display
she carves his name
in the frost

carrying on
as if nothing had happened
dogwood in bloom

canvas almost dry
the tulip leans against
the window

sudden shower
under the azaleas
a toad blinks

skylight
a sycamore leaf
slides across the moon

its song
bigger than the graveyard
winter robin

the old man
shovelling winter
off his path

conspicuous
in a frosted field
the brown hare

morning frost
invitation to a white
wedding

holiday's end
her train
swallowed by fog

stuck to the window
a cherry petal darkens
autumn sunset

grains of dust
on my black shirt
birthday night

into a tree's arms
out of the subway
escalator

in love
the spins
of atoms

closing time
a dandelion's dance
with the wind

the shoe seller kicks a butt
into the canal

starts to unravel

i learn more about her
from the open garage

for the first time
letting a feather be

hot summer day
my niece orders me
to make it snow

pebbled beach
no sound skips
into the new year

fading fast
the low hoot
of an owl

open window
autumn rearranging
my desk

sand through my toes
a white crane
spreads its wings

cloud cover
fingering
her lost necklace

peach skin
summer slips away

starry night
pills snug
in their bottle

tugging
at its leash
summer

a morning glory
cupped in his hand
the sky

no moon tonight
dead leaves shine
by the gate

in the fire
sounds the rising
winter wind

fourteen stories up
a leaf rising
before it falls

mountain overlook
we speak
in whispers

below the dock
fish squirm in the net
spring moon

cedar logs spit
into the flames

the red shadow
of my wine glass

dried edges
of summer leaves

another empty field

the deep bow
of tulips

the scent of clover
in her hair

gnarled branch
my grandmother
drops her knitting

in the bluebells

the black cat anchors
my feet

the forsythia sprays
above high water

a vee of geese
we drop stones into
the bridge's shadow

autumn equinox
three chrysanthemums
on an old grave

tall ships
the rifted sky
closes opens

autumn light
my son burrows deeper
in the bedcovers

dust motes
the circled memory
of a vase

the rustle of reeds
as we drift into shore
last day of summer

scarred and gray
a crooked birch
mimes the wind

heirloom quilt
at the foot of the bed
a dog snoring

early frost
an empty space
where the hammock swung

in the shade
of a towering oak
acorns dropping

sawdust
where the old maple stood
crickets at dusk

august sun
a dog sniffs the garden
and pees

late frost
one by one
magnolia blossoms

into the first day starlings
softly scatter their shit

my old car glazed with salt
new moon

spider web
the limits of my thought

a grackle not as black
as the memory of
grackles

mounting
last year's cat tails
a redwing's red wings

skipping stones
on the river
a glimpse of the moon

a dog barks
after moonset
perseids

new moon weekend
a campground full
of telescopes

anchoring
his punch line
a comedian's yacht

cloudless sky
the blueberries
in our backpack

a river of corn lilies
divides the meadow
yellow butterfly

molten sunset
a black-bellied plover
on the inlet beach

a sudden dip
starboard
moon jellies

glancing up
from book to window
wordless moon

autumn twilight
a last insistence
of crickets

half moon
wiping peach juice
from my chin

stray breeze
through the lavender
morning heat

under the voices
of summer birds
raven

the glow
of windfall peaches
morning cool

withered twists
of morning glory
next time

record heat
the crepe myrtle’s fan
against red bricks

humid dusk
in the creek a dragonfly's
reflection

evening stillness
between bird songs
thunder rolls

november field
the buck's antlers
like dried stalks of corn

muggy sunrise
the brown spider crawling
up the web

clouds reflecting
the orange moon
october cornfield

passing
summer storm
no rainbow

window frost
she picks out old songs
on my old guitar

deep shadows
over my father's grave
oak leaves

sit-ups
earth and sky
earth and sky

wisteria droops
over the utility wires
speed trap

high tide
the taste of salt
on your lips

sun-worshippers
wild rosehips ripen
in the dunes

spring fever
the blue sky tugs
at my kite

between the reeds
and a drifting canoe
perfect silence

morning fire
listening to wrens
while the coffee boils

an old man fishing
scowls at the otter
also fishing

just before dawn
a thousand frogs
swallow their voices

green shoots
in the cherry tree's shade
last year's cherries

green apples
bouncing on the sidewalk
summer wind

june rain
our cucumber vines
gnawed by rabbits

my shadow goes first
fallen cherry blossoms

take this rain said the old man
to his wife sweeping sidewalk puddles

lilies bend and pour their tea
summer storm

from atop the lightning
struck sycamore
a blackbird's hymn

on ash wednesday again
my grandmother's lilac perfume

all painting ends with butterflies
my daughter watches the dawn

straining to listen
the crickets' first movement begins

summer moonrise
the distance between sea stars
shrinking

the sun's afterglow
a pile of shrimp shared
off a paper placemat

gentle sway of kelp
along wooden docks
summer sea

august road trip
i fix the air conditioning
on a borrowed car

midsummer quiet
the cascading shades
of mountain ridges

bats on top
of the deodars
waning moon

gray morning
the whole world
a foghorn

not filling
our silences
cicadas

early cool
a bee's zzzs
in a zinnia

morning shade
of the prickly pears
scurrying quail

august night
flipping the pillow
again

a gap
in the leaf shadows
summer moon

morning fog
a yellow backhoe
cutting through

the scar
of a contrail
autumn clarity

maple leaves
silver side up
the sound of coming rain

convertible
the night filled with
honeysuckle

pink dusk
the heavy scent of
mimosas

scattered thunderstorms
the lawn
half mown

one tree without buds
last year's
empty nest

beneath pasture trees
the cows
shaped like shadows

between the trees
hammock moon

french lessons
the taste of earth
on a radish

snapdragons
my mother's eyes
in my mirror

leaden sky
over a flag-draped coffin
each breath

sultry night
the white distance
between us

crescent moon
my old knees
creak up the stairs

hoarfrost
the orange droop
of persimmons

clear water
over river stones
forget me not

faded lilacs
a black capped chickadee
sings from branch to branch

clouds of gnats
hover behind our ears
first drop of rain

apple blossoms
float to the ground
a house wren's trill

spring ritual
naked in the firelight
killing ticks

cherry bush
drooping with fruit
sparrows and finches

sudden downpour
even the cats
come inside

sultry day
bedsheets flapping
on the clothesline

kite flying weather
even the crows stop to watch

in my robe on the doorstep
surprised by the morning moon

the cricket too has a shadow
oaks at sunset

grass gone to seed waving waving
to the abandoned house

his urn finally arrives
a careful breeze in the palms

the oak's shade denser every day
my daughter practices her violin

father's day
the chime of his clocks
over the phone

her collection
of percussion instruments
the rain outside

whale watching
at lover's point
only pelicans

the drip drip
of my mother's iv
hospital koi

traffic jam
on the way to the freeway
spring birdsong

another
dead camera battery
fading peonies

echoes of polkas
a row of empty
accordion cases

her old cd
on the long drive
wild mustard

my fingernails
hopeless once more
planter's moon

flawless desert sky
my husband spots
the warplane

sunk deep
into twilight
the white clematis

a sky
too large for it
oil patch town

morning heat
a swallowtail drifts
into the blue

acoma graveyard wall
the hole for spirits
filled with sky

waning moon
the first crickets
join in

between
pond ripples
dusk

pink peonies
in evening
the scent of wine

dandelion field
gone to seed
evening sun

not a leaf twitches
distant thunder

one vanilla scoop
moon rising over the
brooklyn bridge

flash flood
all the bushes
full of roses

pink dawn
fallen cherry blossoms

blueberrying
the afternoon rolls
off our fingertips

winter rain
streaks the office window
my reflection

va cemetery
the distant taps
of a woodpecker

rifted clouds
the sunlight splinters
on choppy waves

shoveling snow
a wind gust halos
the street light

slanted light
over the mown lawn
i inhale green

deep woods
our old nick-names
on the copper beech

year's end
a trail of frozen footsteps
on the sidewalk

body prints
in a crusty snowbank
december rain

red cheeks
the wind blowing back
what the shovel throws

rabbit tracks
through fresh snow
a prowling cat

winter slump
wearing out the fabric
of my easy chair

plowed and replowed
this icy street
growing narrow

winter!
a slick sheet of ice
on the welcome mat

winter solstice
a crescent moon
quickens the night

funeral party
snow grows thick
on the front steps

he shouts
hawk   above
the whining highway

behind the iris
another iris
watching the moon

framed
in the kitchen window
venus rising

the mulberry tree
has shed its burden
new moon

desert sunset
one crow
follows the moon

winter solitude
each leaf brimming
with water

salt wind
each step in the sand
a bit deeper

summer quiet
the stars dare me
to count them

leaves wait
under the garden hose
temple driveway

easter incense
the prayers i never learned
in latin

the hummingbird
dives for attention
winter cactus

rattle of pebbles
in the cove
september sea

bright leaves
the quick dark
of a field mouse

the spider web
not there yesterday
autumn light

late snow
a red tulip sideways
to the sun

hazy moon
the first stirrings
of seeds

the weight
of late sunlight
peach boughs

these crickets
loud as the moon
summer's end

nothing moves
but the smallest leaves
august

summer moon
yellow canoe
capsized

icicles hanging
from rocks    another
valentine's day

boardwalk off season
riding the carousel
with my parents

early dusk
the scent of fireplace smoke
on my jacket

one white sail
on the horizon
silence between waves

black cows
on the hillside
her mother's missing teeth

burning
the last of the firewood
new year's eve

across the meadows
the whooper swans
that had to stay

the shape of rocks
where the river stops
the sea

lifting seeds
from the thistles
the goldfinched wind

each one on sunlight
the yellowhammer's phrases

tracing the fades
of the spring river
the wagtail's tail

day moon
the little grebes
leap into light

slanted rain
the first lilies
opening

apple blossoms
arc
of the welder's torch

highland
the sheep's wool
slightly longer

father's day
picking up
the same broken shells

lowland stream
pussy willows
put on their boots

easter morning
the tilted heads
of daffodils

a leaf caught
in the chain link fence
dying wind

frozen river
something stirs
within me

not one bird
in hoarfrosted trees
i hurry home

morning fog
deciding what to wear

power failure
watching the moon
instead of tv

nursing home
at every window
a bird feeder

pathway
a dropped glove points
in all directions

wilderness stars
the silence
of our thoughts

flower moon
the scent
of night phlox

watercolor class
rain streaks
on the windows

wading
into the lake
into the stars

sundown
the slap
of a beaver's tail

under the lilac
the scent
of hide and seek

one sock on
one sock off
spring sun

for sale sign
a chrysalis
hangs from the frame

a crow leaps
from the bare branch
spring morning

i take off my glove
to show my daughter
the pleiades

a rainbow of children
gathering easter eggs

clouds racing
a sundog
disappears

cooking
mid-blizzard
i add more curry

snowflakes
on a black windshield
the stars fade

distant stars
scattered across the sky
plum blossoms

spring rain
the lawn chairs
bicker

tui song
borrowing the light
of the moon

houdini's grave
sparrows turn
into clouds

every leaf moving
every shadow
moving

hangover
an empty beercan
fills with rain

silence
after the argument
cicadas

thunder at dusk
moving closer
solitude

mosquito landing
the light touch on my hand
before it bites

high desert
a plane of cracked lines
in the old man's face

greening up
forsythia petals
yellow the ground

iris garden
the sisters pose
in purple dresses

afternoon fog
the tide rolls in
with soft splashes

space between trees
the rhythm of two hawks
wheeling

hammock nap
the distant buzz
of a lawnmower

umbrellas opening
the smell of worms

midsummer
a truck rusting in a field
of sunflowers

rainstorm
smokers huddled
under the stairs

in the bird's nest
my lost bracelet

pulling weeds
the cheery warble
of an ice cream truck

moths orbit
the porch lamp
quarter moon

filling with snow
crow's nest

sundown
a few red berries
on bare branches

winter solstice
under the evergreen
rabbits huddle

parking lot
the moon reflected
in an oil slick

bus stop
the conversation takes
a strange turn

thrift store
i find my donations
in the bargain bin

moonless night
street lights illuminate
falling snow

spring morning
my daughter dances
with the wind

stocks rise
blue space
between clouds

my daughter's first steps
where i first walked
garden scent

fall picnic
ripe berries
in the bush

the fireworks
the constellations
summer heat

his snoring
the fly
buzzing in the window

possibilities
the prayer flags
not moving moving

hours before snow
the white
of the sycamore

cleaning the shotgun
oil stains
on my fingers

new year's eve
raccoons
topple trash cans

out of the endless
winter clouds
a snowflake

outside goodwill
a new pair of old jeans
and the blue sky

the whiteness
as she lifts her shirt
moonlit snow

indian summer
the tang of woodsmoke
sweeter now

throwing out
yesterday's violets
dusk falls

between
tree shadows
bird shadows

moonlight
on every street
moonlight

spring field
every leaf touching
every leaf

still dividing
the family
grandma's will

balancing
on a blade of grass
nightfall

long grass
the weight of raindrops
on my skin

bare trees
silhouetted at sunset
the drift of wood smoke

tree viewing
a thinner crowd
on the steep trail

spring breezes
first peonies
then sage

first warm day
an ant explores
the kitchen counter

evening fog
the crack of a home run
from the ball park

rusty tugboat
rocking on the river tide
an orange sky

coffee on the porch
a moth-eaten sweater
in the autumn dusk

ice storm
each pine needle
dipped in glass

reading outside 
ladybug explores my hand

way past curfew
jasmine blossoms
unfolding

icicles
on the mailbox
valentine's day

january
cat turns on
the electric blanket

cardinal swivels
on the weather vane
first snowflakes

snapped twig
the taste
of stolen apples

hay bales
on the horizon
harvest moon

chinook wind
a dog stretched out
on the sidewalk

glass of wine
the same rosy color
as this sunset

hay field
a herd of black cows
motionless

main street
a sign points the way
to the cemetery

town buried
under a rock slide
fog rolls in

mining town
tavern door propped open
with a pickaxe

autumn morning
the shape of steam
rising from my tea-cup

more darkness
more stars
moving on

chocolate
between sips of red wine
winter evening

cloudless dusk
the hot air balloon
coasting

chipped nail polish
the red
of a leaf falling

first snow
wildlife tracks
now mine

gossip
the mushrooms
in the grass

raw wind
through mountains
what are you are you

autumn dusk
i no longer recall
who gave me this scar

in the orchard
wasps float up
from windfalls

sugar cubes
for the horse
a mackerel sky

half-empty bottle
whiskey trembles
at a touch

outfielder
sees the bat flash
thunder

gets redder

wilting in the vase
my apology

crisscrossing my back
summer doldrums

on a dusty map
the scenic roads

slow raindrops
my polka-dot dress

incoming fog
a forgotten memory
comes in flashes

autumn damp
old leaves composting
in the back lot

late winter cold
long underwear
frayed at the cuffs

last rays of light
bobbing on the waves
a child's beach ball

tire swing
slowly spinning
another leaf falls

winter approaches
woolly caterpillar
stuck to my shoelace

midnight
shadows of bare branches
on my bedroom wall

front yard sunrise
snowdrifts dotted
with rabbit tracks

empty bleachers
a sparrow takes a dust bath
behind home plate

applause for sunset
the steady slapping
of mosquitoes

constellations
melting snowflakes
on a black dog

peeking through
morning fog
mountain peaks

late afternoon
our shadows on the pathway
precede us

moss covered lanterns
in the japanese garden
yellow moon

beachcombing
i find the perfect shell
every few steps

rainy day
the street musician's
empty tip box

overcast sky
the man on crutches
walks his dog

since the wild fires

where two jets passed

snow melt
drips from the roof

the sun through
storm clouds

in the window

on top of the leaves
indian summer

of an un-milked cow

on the clothesline
autumn colors

snowfall

from a deer's eye

all day watching
her pale neck

no exit sign

with boot marks

runs again
in her dreams

drifts by

prays

doubting everything
carillon bells
at noon

counting the atoms
in a blade of grass

the cafe staff cleans
around me

poverty
no matter where you go
the moon

last day of summer
i let the phone ring

two crows
cleaning themselves
fresh snow

frosted meadow
the white horse turns
his rump to the road

morning sharpness
rain soaked leaves
sticking where they fall

fading light
from first to last
a poem not written

summer's end
holding on with coffee
in the garden

silhouetted trees
against a hazy moon
end of vacation

top down
the fragrance
of fresh-cut hay

city park
pausing for the silence
of grass

tulips nodding
students fall asleep
in class

sudden frost
grass shatters
under my feet

mock spring
smell of fabric softener
from the dryer vent

on a split plum

in my teacup

for the hawk's shadow

in the royal fern

the commuter train
sounds its horn

of my wiper blade

forgets the forest

her leg
still broken

meets my broom

of lost mittens

outside the church

into a cross

of my wine glass

between ferns

than on the whale

of catching eagles

beside the bridge

and calf's breath

between the spokes

on a stranger's table

and birdcalls

from the wind

photos in bottles
the sea
of her apartment

stretching out
our conversation

in the roof garden
ice

its checkered coat

of trees

another world

from miso soup

empty

to the barbecue

instead of her hand
i kiss her mitten

blowing snow
not sure which road
will get us home

deciding the rain
wasn't so bad

winter

the song

my teachers
every one
a leaf

all the way
to the hog kill

smell
of snow

tapping
on frozen grass

their whispering

almost keeping up
with the wind

low tide

of a shooting star

already white

taking the lead
spiderwebs
in my face

in cold boots

under the mistletoe
the argument
falters

of a lost moon

through me

of the wild plum
drifted leaves

knee deep leaves
dark with yesterday's rain
and with becoming soil

burn sun pooling
on collarbones

it just began
and already the song is ending
falling leaves

house the color of butterflies
paint chips and flutters away

she checks short dress
long hair in the window
backhoe driver concentrates

workmen lie back in grass
one more cigarette
before the bus

spider leads the sun
into secret places

october wind
extra bailey's
in my coffee

march evening
just enough rain
to fall asleep to

early snow
the last leaf
turns white

sweater morning
cinnamon floats
in hot chocolate

city lights
the distance
between us

autumn wind
how the door
slams

along the shore
the few rocks
we didn't skip

she sings
and the baby hums
hey dum diddley dum

the half-built bridge
i can't
wait

no voice
but wind
october rose

parade over
sound of the old man's
footfalls

tails of two balloons
all they take
with them

moonless night
sometimes it seems
he never came back

rain
the prayer plant
closes early

flock after flock
the sound
of time passing

killing frost
the spicy scent
of fresh thyme

falling leaves
we take the sunny side
of the path

roofless cabin
red flowers
in a crooked box

picking sea holly
the sky
just as blue

first light
chokecherries in
fresh bear scat

falling leaves
pelicans still
on the sandbar

a swirling mist
over november hills
bagpipe serenade

changes in the weather
shadows lengthen
so does his hospital stay

trick or treat
verandah scarecrows
wearing pumpkin grins

closing for the season
we toast
the last marshmallow

weather girl
the low front rolling in
matches her outfit

september departures
my feathered friends
his southbound train

storm clouds
on the horizon
the lump in her breast

all around
the silent backhoe
birdsong

slow night
at the library
flip-flops

pink splits
in the crabapple buds
sneakers today

wolf moon
the path
never clearer

december sky
a jay's voice
shrill blue

flexing sun
across my shoulders
indian summer

faded lavender
the breeze
still sweet

fish-market men
take their time putting up tents
let the rain wash the ocean off

monsoon-season sidewalk
so many umbrellas
a child can walk without one

don't blame the wine
these pine trees keep tripping me
with their shadows

the breeze won't let go of the lilacs
walking away from you

only thing blacker
than raven's wings eyes dark
enough to steal the sun

trees so sunshine-drunk
all the sparrows and finches
can do is hold on

wind shakes the trees the
conversation cut in half
leaves shaped like knife blades

late summer
even the dog
in the shade

evening rain
how quickly the bird bath
overflows

autumn wind
leaving you

snow melt
returning
your call

spring day
flowers
i've never seen

winter night
even the snow
keeps quiet

blizzard
without you
i make
a snow angel

trees
miniaturizing
me

running
with the leaves
autumn

sunny weather
leaves
with you

from the umbrella spoke
rain sliding
down my back

old rosary
the diary
of her hands

after the rain
more than enough blame
to go around

two crickets call
in the dark
a door unlocks

faint shadow
under the straw hat
summer heat

coin's cadence
as it drops in the cup
street musicians

breeze wafts
between the lark's notes
summer afternoon

the silence
of the crickets
lunar eclipse

going the wrong way
down the street
a mockingbird

chasing after
a fire truck
the moon

along the path
footsteps
leading to nowhere

melodic minor flute tones
oak leaves falling

eggs with ketchup
old teacher calls me
out of class

white sail
cloth over water
all geese crossing

well-washed golf shirt
pale canary shade
the last of daylight

losing track of place
on patchwork quilt
despite dropped crumbs

buttered toast blueberries
yogurt cheese with cinnamon
crossword half complete

foot spa forming
copper water
outside orioles

almond blossoms
an old man squatting
near an open cage

autumn leaves
the stillness of the girl's sandals
near a headstone

a blown kiss
pampas grass sways
towards the river

women shelter
yasmin scents spread
beyond the fence

valentine morning
time to release
the lovebirds

after a
long night
the morning glory

first butterfly
a child asks
if it's real

home to his daughter
the grime deeper than his skin
hugs with his elbows

my city's people
a fern of iron filings
to the magnet oil

poised with the kettle
she thinks better of it and
leaves the ants alone

cursing a moss flap
he rakes the lawn in snowboots
shorts hat shirt untucked

insert perceptive
seventeen syllable verse
without humor here

this chinook valley
tangible brahms requiem
choir spit valves and all

in spring the first smell
of mown grass strange to think i'll
be it when i'm gone

in the foxhole
a pair of soldier's boots
yearns to come home

my garden
in autumn
buds cemetery

the space
between a bare tree and a fog
long months of winter

in early dawn
flock of birds returns
with the fog

in an old diary
between pages
withered rose

marble angels
on the church greet me
with carved smiles

moonless night
in my patio leaps
a black cat

nine to five
the lilac sprig
in my hair

wisteria
the hippy sway
of her braid

dappled light
all the fiddleheads'
tight curves

drifting leaves
one flawless
windfall apple

hospice visit
the daffodil stems
in a clear vase

maple leaves
in their crisp shuffle
our childhood

gibbous moon
the teacup's curve
in her hands

floating down
the waterslide
midday sun

one more turn
down the boulevard
into the sunrise

cloud fragments
on a summer breeze
skywriter

the wheelchair
by the swing set
her feet touch the air

a small hand
reaches for the stars
moon bounce

last piece of sand
in his shoe
end of vacation

the blue moons
of her soul
a newborn's eyes

stuffed animal child
on the receiving end
of lifelong love

pine wild
accidental majesty
faun's damp fur

glare from parked chrome
thoughtless neighbor
spitting in my eye

ink on pinstripe lines
my faith
a kind of sentence

squirrel's delicate
turning of acorn
i almost kiss you

her fireside
the inner thigh of snowfall

song accompanied
by flute breath
under sterling skin

silent love
the rose unfolds
its first petal

crowded park
a couple hugs
in my shadow

refugee camp
sculpting a tree trunk
into a cross

a pine tree falls
the sparrow's song
goes on

waning moon
on her mourning dress
a white pacifier

peace talk
the third crow
of a rooster

romeo and juliet
the seat next to me
remains vacant

collar up mitts on
the driving snow chair-lifts me
along the sidewalk

small girls with ideas
the real reason
kittens are born blind

in her cubicle
everything looks real in the
540 sunlight

the bird has elvis
hair wonders at the ice with
eyes like loose buttons

the wet kleenex snow
blob on the sidewalk holds her
entire small handprint

your every thought
comes to flower in someone
else's obsession

beauty is in the
eye of the beholder who
didn't forget his glasses

in the mist
my shadow tries to find its
way home

morning drizzle
birds evacuate their home
while we sleep

autumn morning
nothing but gray sky
and drizzle

chilly wind here
withered leaves there
autumn's home

still sky
no birds no breeze
morning after the war

under the moonlight
my reflection on the pond
a hundred years old

on the temple's bridge
a shadow passes by
that you buddha?

slanted light
the receptionist files
her nails

wisteria
that twisted stitch
in my knitting

heavy rain
all those iris clumps
still undivided

distant thunder
rising creak
of a mooring line

daylilies
my son's face
freckled orange

dappled light
the tight curves
of fiddleheads

fairy rings
in the meadow
an old foundation

moon glides
past the fishing boats
low tide

door knob turns
opening the past
grandmother's house

the long
and short of it
a dachshund

minnows
in the pond
slivers of starlight

sudden rainstorm
the dog shakes off
each drop

half moon
the night shift's
lunch break

fresh strawberry
from the garden
a taste of red

teacup thimble-sized
of harsh root
eyes only for you

shoulder tap
another passenger
returns my pen

losing candidate
with quiet on the brain
resumes the fetal pose

straw blond boy
where you conclude
and i begin

white kimono
often confused
with nine hundred count percale

honorarium
goat's milk
for the dehydrated

light morning traffic
cat walks
against my leg

that fish
endlessly swimming
in the same pot

calm night
those clouds weave
one dream after another

wedding
a daisy stretches its roots
in an olive tree's soil

setting sun
taller than the kid
grandma's cane

earthquake alarm
trees raise their hands
towards the sky

camp
she asks her father
what is a refugee!

borders
the olive branches sway
beyond the barbwire

weeds between buildings
no sun no rain tike's piddle
and still they flower

magpie's jumbled nest
bottle caps dog nuggets and
vole fur welcome mat

summer 300am
the wake of the bicycle
smells like a snow bank

morning the magpie
persnicks the ochre vomit
on the tavern steps

cubical snug plays
solitaire eats like you would
load a pellet gun

saturated drunks
squeeze out of the bars like earth
worms after a rain

all those big snowflakes
spraying slow from the streetlights
worth the sleepless night

dust
against the sunlight
spring dance!

spring break
my wardrobe holds its
yearly sale

on a spring day
smell of carnation and
laundry soap

under the water
sunlight above
kaleidoscope

rocking chair
sits in the attic
counting years

memories of home
smell of dust and
mama's lemon pie

on a green lush tree
sparrow enjoys his
spring rent

roman candles!
her small finger
connects the stars

harvest moon
a bat stream funnels
up to cassiopeia

twilight shadows
in the lakeside pines
herons settle

dust motes
the unfinished weight
of knitting

deep shadows
i play hide and seek
with the sun

bread crumbs
one pigeon
toes closer

sun slants
stripe the veranda
my bare feet

low tide
waves curve
with the crescent moon

tattered prayer flag
along the roadside
spring breeze

leftovers
after the holiday
morning moonshine

morning traffic
the honks
of migrating geese

watching a sunset
in black and white
the color-blind man

blue shadows
singing harmony
humpback whales

sound of birds
under the ear muffs
early spring

she drinks
more for the company

enough
pieces of silver
for flute fingers

her being here
warmth melting
footprints in the snow

phone rings invitation
to forget what i am
doing

pipe leaking
a way to get to know
new neighbors

scent of cigarette
at the front door
ann arbor's winter light

in the confessional
buddha plugging his ears

turbulent sea
the silence of a fish
on that rock

autumn morning
strutting behind his shadow
the old turkey

that full moon
a coin falls into
the beggar's palm

by the river
my rough dream drifts
towards the sea

first dew touch
shyly the lily unfolds
her petals

cloudy morning
a kite flies higher
than its string

winter morning
high waves challenge
an empty chair

one cricket reviews
the night's performance just as
the house lights go up

if this lame assed
kiss ever ends i'm going to
write her a poem

the farmer's barley
threadbare as bad hair implants
will not pay for his

damn before she died
i should have got her to knit
me a grandmother

she's plucking eyebrows
from the wall mirror like an
escher drawn escher

clattering maple
hoists a jolly safeway bag
over the wind's spoils

bee departs orchid
airs its tongue the bee returns
for dusty seconds

writing haiku
me my pen and
brother worm

dust
in the sunlight
spring fairies

paw prints
on the floor
spring's here

white sheets
against the spring breeze
soldiers in white

spring breeze
smell of flowers and
starch

after breakfast
sparrow cleans her
nest

spring morn
nothing but flying kites and
tangled hair

daybreak
the tone poem
of birds

frosted pumpkins
the roofers hammer
a clear sky

wide sky
spreading the pond
the lotus

slanted rain
over his coffin
the echo of taps

this longest night
knitting the baby's blanket
into socks

slow tide
the clam-digger's
steady rake

faded pansies
pressed in the album
all those faces

dragged across the grass
lifted by wind
the kite

scorched tree
and another
porcupine mountain

one hundred waxwings
resting
on thin branches

four crows flounder
stale meat
lost between wharf boards

bottoms in the air
a line
of missing ducks

sparkles across water
green on green on
plunk

red spot
on a white napkin
the lady bug

still alive
under all that ice
the mountain stream

the moment
our bootfalls stop
a squirrel's rasp

painted yellow
its trunk its roots
the bleeding pine

field of rock
the quick teeth
of mountain sheep

growing sideways
in the deep forest
a single birch

black on white
a raven's footsteps
on new snow

athabasca falls
this empty bowl
of winter stone

sick in bed
birds' silhouettes make whole notes
on the power lines

plumbing truck
a flush trumps a full house
dumps a lump of snow

breaking up talk
boyfriend's car parked
facing the street

fruit wedge moon
from the snow-snug hot tub
sky's one big drink

half moon
dog's bark above
the factory noise

first growl of thunder
dachshund sniffs the gravel
for his own scent

crossdrift moire
bible camp kids
swarm the sundeck

we say not a word
nature reminds us time lost
a river slowing

fresh tracks through bare field
behind crows pick clean the bones
of slow city feet

winter's sweeping scythe
cuts first an ear hands cold clenched
in pocket bottoms

men in suits rush past
connecting flights you smile back
from a photograph

what wind finds you here
begging shadows coins tapping
songs for an alley

winter sun recedes
a street light follows us home
white flakes on lashes

moon on a black screen
snow in the projector light
make nothing happen

a full moon night
an oar dips
cutting the moon

evening sun
caught in a braid of cloud
a hummingbird soars

on a full moon night
jasmines hang low
droop silver

summer wind whispers
to the cemetery willow
she fights back tears

skeletons of the aspen
snowflakes dance
the winter away

deep silence of the valley
a cricket's rasp
loud and painful

one by one starlings
fan into november skies
frozen wire sags

lemon slices
in the glass of iced tea
sour thoughts

reading my tea leaves
the fortune teller
shakes her head

tea for one
stack of sympathy cards
unopened

butter melts
on warm tea biscuits
snow almost gone

sipping green tea
from a styrofoam cup
stomach in knots

blizzard sounds
the old tea kettle's
faint whistle

chilly afternoon
we share a pot of tea
and hot gossip

wishing they were flowers
he holds her bouquet of bras
at the change room

star gazing on the trampoline
if he would move the house
they could see the moon too

snow topped roofs
white angles intersect
night black sky

winter night silent
as the o-shaped mouth
of the moon

the blue-eyed cat gone
was it coyotes
or that flock of big ravens?

moaning geese on the pond
the undulating s
of their necks

in the bouquet
on his coffin
love-lies-bleeding

counting hawks i see
i might have been a great man
no time for that now

a blanket of clouds
in the back seat of the car
my daughter asleep

a firefly spinning
in a glass of amber beer
if this be dying

hey mockingbird
quit showing off already
i'm trying to write

freeing the ego
doesn't mean abandoning
your love of peaches

rain!
snail gets home
sooner

long after the wind
pines along the mountain hold
the shape of the wind

death mask?
a crumpled plastic bag
in the bare branches

water tower bar
car commercial reflected
in the view window

empty white chair
at the edge of the meadow
a tape measure's click

considerate wind
leaves a plastic bag
in the blackberries!

clank of iron
two butterflies ascend
in their mating dance

old cemetery
i stop to search for
a four-leaf clover

church atop the hill
hawk glides in smaller circles
above the swather

leafless bush alone
a season without need of
peacocks or feathers

highway diaper change
she coos cold wisps of cars pass
her white breath and mine

white coffin on snow
the diggers are still digging
say earth is too hard

inside the limo
oblong windows the crows pass
through pictures of sky

black cars drive themselves
suits wind flutters pages me
buried in my clothes

cold flesh of waiting
sighing into cupped palms hands
like burning buildings

white winter solstice
dying light of afternoon
listening to snow

dew-washed grapes
the crystal bowl
reflects the ripeness

in the blinding rain
the city lights blink
one by one

the cuckoo sings
a lonely song
i shed a silent tear

a sparrow hops
from branch to branch
a cat eyes him from below

curls of smoke
rise from my coffeepot
the soft patter of rain

mist-wrapped sunrise
frost on aspen leaf
solitary deer smells the day

peeping through a venetian blind
i caught the quarter moon
blinking at me

after
the house party
wiping doorknobs

thrift store
a box of dolls
with tangled hair

full moon
our stroll in the park
interrupted

new moon
same old argument
about nothing

drifting
with the snow
a plastic bag

shining through
the heavy snowfall
tavern lights

liquor store
the help wanted sign
tilted

red stained ravens perch
wing to wing on its ribs
oh deer

berry laden mountain ash
seeks
flock of hungry grosbeaks

downtown pigeons flock
north south back again
indecisive roosters

pre-dawn moon
scraps of silver
patch my floor

a silver scimitar
new moon slices
night blue sky

farm visit
talk of a cougar bear
the big dog listens

1159 my neighbor's fireworks
going to be
a hurry up year

each morning the stink
of fox piss warns the poet
don't prettify me!

the cherry blossoms
drift down in gentle showers
every springcom

a heron peers down
through the surface of the lake
stalking a heron

ocean winds scatter
cheerios tossed by the handful
to a one-legged gull

rabbits at market
their furs pulled off like mittens
shiny newborn limbs

a midwinter fly
banging against the window
me too pal me too

all the bright songbirds
flew from this cold months ago
only crows remain

among new buds
last year's bird nest
a kind of chalice

semester over!
a butterfly lands on
the skill saw blade

lady's mantle
rhinestone raindrops
on every leaf!

gray after rain
still the lilacs shout
we're whiter than white!

little windfall apples
cartoon cherry bombs
that went pffft

son on drugs?
more mud than sand
in the sand bar

plastered with bird shit
the old school piano
still gives us a c

new morning sunrise
dawn's slumbering aria
our silent music

ancient stories told
creaks and cracks of forest trees
refusing language

a river slowing
slates float across still surface
heavy with moonlight

distant mountain peaks
afternoon sun retreating
gold to auburn sky

frost on morning glass
winter's gentle face voices
whisper through windows

borealis cry
banners glowing in twilight
a city in flames

first breath of winter
only the berries remain
remembering red

fading sun
casts fleeting shadows
each brick tells a story

white horses dot
leaf-flecked meadows
autumn wind in the hair

a dewdrop sits on top of a
a freshly curled petal
i glimpse the sky

autumn wind ruffles my hair
fallen petals
float on still waters

and there lies the ocean
so gray and deep
a bobbing yacht

winter's misty rain pours on
slippery highways
the dying moan of a car

i shed a tear or two
standing in the shadow of time
the sun-dappled meadow

storm clouds
sheep on the hillside
standing still

suspended
from the leafless branch
wasp's nest

a clearing
in the forest
thoughts muddled

separating
these trees from those trees
fence in the woods

on both sides
of the cemetery fence
wild flowers

field of hay bales
and their shadows
the hawk's wingspan

morning chill
neighbor's chainsaw
starts stops

warm wind undresses us
coat-carrying woman
sighs

while shopping i sneeze
from the next aisle
an invisible woman blesses me

blushing mom
at the store
little boy brought his doll

busker at the market
my coins sing
in his guitar case

i fill the feeder
chickadee sings
we are grateful

puddle drinkers
feet soakers
three thirsty crows

golden coyote
runs beside my car
we both stop to stare

if you can conceive
of hell dante discovered
you're already there

o dust o broom
o sweeper made of dust
o broom o dust

a long loon wail
from the heart of the still lake
it breaks it breaks

classes at navy
walking past white grave markers
with whitman in hand

the dust of two towers
is slowly obscured by smoke
from a thousand towns

a mare licks her foal
first one ear then the other
tasting herself

cicadas leave shells
deer bones but what shall i
let the wind scatter?

ah grasshopper
such a robust click of wings
for such tawny hills

apples mealy now
better topped with snow
and happy waxwings!

off-leash dog run
both dogs still grinning
all the way home

chamomile
even in the deepest ruts
your dry sweet smell

prickly pear
hidden in golden grass
still green and holding

tawny coulee
against the wind cicadas'
insistent whir

busy gal
the license plate says
she primps in rear view

here in the shoebox
time passes like a creature
outgrowing its cage

winter's voices heard
a goose calls to others trees
mutter to themselves

fog upon the stream
a genie in the valley
seeking his lantern

still morning water
paints a portrait of its sky
brushstrokes of tree line

a sunflower field
millions of tiny faces
smiling in daylight

tibetan prayer
carried in strands by the wind
to clouds made of stone

white sand ocean sky
mermaids undulating hips
drawn into mountains

the shadow of the willow
stalks the meadow
a lone sparrow hops

the iris in the narrow vase
droops low
the fading sunlight

still air warm and suffocating
hangs heavy
a floating lily near the shore

the gray chasm of the evening
fills with warbler cries
the silent pond

a soft whisper of breeze
dandelions gently sway
fleeting time

the hills knobbled with hay
a breath of spring
in the magpie's song

hillsides turn brown
fall approaches
i return home

night sky
over meteor crater
the moon also round

river bank
someone's to do list
flutters in the breeze

biting into
the fortune cookie
tooth chips

wherever i am
park signs tell me
you are here

small bird
on a cattail
not singing

resting awhile
on the memorial bench
cares forgotten

grocery store
the male cashier
touches my melons

frost thaws
on pansy faces
chilled to tears

night sky
one star in a hole
in the clouds

half moon silver bowl
stands on its lip
in the sky

moonlight finds
my face
i shine

night walk full moon
steel rails gleam
to vanishing point

night walk full moon
tree shadows
bar the road

dusk walk
road dance
with a hopping toad

vesper sparrow?
savannah? hard to tell
give me some song

wanted an old porch
horses grazing in pasture
rainy wind loose shoes

pouring coffee
into a chipped white mug
i watch an eclipse

the carpenter draws
dimensions for the new house
on a 2x4

over the hayfields
a barn owl floats searching
ok i'll listen too

lifting firewood
i find my wife's silk bra
inside my shirtsleeve

palominos circle
the split oil drum to drink
water filled with stars

car trip home
up up
to your right
an airplane cloud

quarter moon
shrouded in mist
lovers kiss

ancient oak
displays autumn foliage
i too grow old

smelling the lily
its orange heart
on my nose

between the trees
swoop of colored wing and feather
and hammock song of summer

garage sale
in with the knick-knacks
their wedding album

forsythia's unpruned branches
tap abandoned windows

a cloud wisp
floats down the street
a cottontail runs

remembering which herb
to pick in the garden
gingko

a few gray streaks
over the temple
the twilight

rolling down the hills
with the boys
dog days of summer

his face
next to mine
whiskers

playing tag
on the front yard
the gray squirrels

summer afternoon
the passing shade
of a butterfly

kite-flying weather
soaring in the troposphere
hawk on outstretched wings

goldfish dreaming of cats
open-mouth suffocation
drowning in air

under the top stair
eight-legged inhabitant
busy spinning webs

blossoming plum tree
bees droning in the petals
creating haiku

purple scented air
hovering over the lilacs
transient moment

warm easter morning
fungus grips a dead lilac trunk
resurrection

ewe on her back
frantic hooves paw the sky
clumsy fallen cloud

standing on muir beach
you silent just watching earth's
slow tumble seaward

afternoon light-bloom
soft heavy hot lean against
me an old lover

your arms around me
still eyes whispering my cheek
wave's soft hesitance

backyard smoke trailing
like voices' drift from the street
the leaves die silent

dear c i think i
needed your strength   to get here
sorry i can't stay

the darkness hums all
our forgotten stars  replaced
bent heads of streelights

morsel sticky-sweet
neck's nape where we hide kisses
orange round and pored

walmart closed
carts on icy parking lot
pushed by autumn wind

cold autumn day
lost shoe on roadside
fills with snow

everywhere neon signs
a glimpse
of the harvest moon

stillness of silence
a fish swallows
an autumn fly

goodbye hug
the blue of the
forget me nots

a nostalgic moment
the scattered rose petals
below the rose bush

walking home
i startle
two not-quite white rabbits

first snow
dusts the sidewalk
footprints give me away

gray sky
the combine crawls
across the field

on the table
this morning
a fallen blossom

clay on the wheel
deep breath
reaching for the centre

one last tomato
in the bowl
overripe skin wrinkled

bowl rests on the table
two tomatoes waiting
last taste of summer

not yet dark
a june moon shows up
early for work

in the vase
on the kitchen table
wild flowers

early morning mist
the lake
larger

august heat wave
through the swelter
the crow's crisp chatter

budding romance
between them on the porch swing
a just opening rose

leaves
on the backyard walnut tree
sing in the shower

august dock
in my lakeside chair
slow rocking

the trout
views the hook
flash of rainbow

rip tide
the man's speedos
floating away

dunk shot
caught in the net
of her blue eyes

hundreds of feet
marching down the dirt path
centipede

an hour's walk
and getting nowhere
the treadmill

on the park bench
the laughter of childhood
skates by

sudden storm
the street art fades
into rainbows

moon sets stars fade
sun rises warm on her face
all the hours between

children with scissors
creating paper flowers
peonies in bloom

night of the new moon
shadow pools outside lamp's light
deep well of darkness

water-soaked morning
puddles mirror cloudy skies
white petals floating

skin against my palm
you trace translucent road maps
read cartographer

dandelion orb
gentle exhalation
scattering parachutes

weave the shroud by day
penelope's memories
unravel at night

tangerine night i
open myself to you your
wishless starless pane

like night speaks its soft
regressions into gaps in
us
heart finally flush

light touches down
already present and gone somehow
just like your skin

bring your oiled sweat
in palmfulls  i will set my
self afire here

your flesh a fever
limning me in this way
i lay hold upon i

cut her
hair lost her
fingers on a dare tore her
nothin' but her bones

these films we do not mourn
celluloid skin   ensilvered
time's forgotten flesh

the rip in the
screen door
summer's end

windless morning
the owl feather
on the deck

cozy in the cabin
an owl's hoot
from the forest

on my black and white
running shoe the black
and white butterfly

he shows me his tattoo
the tree shadow
on the sidewalk

safe in his arms
always
the moon

after work
all of sudden
the first cherry blossoms

moon large as a saucer
a black cloud
spilt tea

rain fills ditches
perfect
for boats

late night low rolling
thunder  someone upstairs
moving furniture

gray curtain
pulled across the sky
rain later

strong breeze
clouds sweep by
the top of the tree

the eagle soars
rolls over shows talons
to an attacking hawk

last sliver of the moon
smiles  dimpled
by a single star

late summer
still in the nest
the eggs  chirpless

summer vacation in
veranda beach
and porto backyarda

two squirrels
eye to eye
eying the same nut

from the earth
green shoots erupting
they know it's time

spring recital
mozart on the piano keys
bird warbles at the window

in the lake
two boys drop anchor
school bell rings

on the ledge
of the open window
three halved eggshells

summer sunset
walking down the path
with my shadow

white clouds float
across the yard
dandelion wishes

one quick peek
over the fence
trampoline

summer breeze
under shape shifting clouds
the first rain drop

curling up
when problems arise
armadillo

not by bread alone
the joy
of peanut butter and jelly

lucky dog
on the street corner
a new fire hydrant

classroom bully
five-foot-ten seventh-grade boy
with vacant eyes

angry companions
sitting at the coffee shop
swallowing iced rage

a girl plucks petals
he loves me he loves me not?
death of a daisy

art or graffiti?
spray-painted glyphs on sidewalk
speaking ugly words

left in the closet
an umbrella forgotten
rain cloud emptying

picnic with music
six-legged organisms
form a conga line

muddy feline prints
carcass bloodies welcome mat
feathered offering

icicle slender
bone to her caressing palm
her sun-pregnant flesh

an empty wind sighs
my lungs red balloons hanging
here inspace heartshape

outer shell we only touch
point where one ravels
into absence skin

bone and blood speaking
speaking its deep eloquence
like night speaks darkness

the sweat dripping dripping into your eyes like tears
for all my efforts

wire-latticed sky
telephone lines suture timelines parted flesh mends

dripping wet honeyheaded soft pearl strings of dew
tremble tender shoots

my sandprints
the path behind
the path yet to be

the patchouli scent
from the cosmetic counter
teenage flashback

grandma asleep in hospital bed
the sweet peas wilting
on windowsill

children's coats on hooks
in the old library
the fresh air scent

sleeping in
his side of the bed
still warm

talking after not talking
for so long
the layers of stars

on my back on the shore i
make a sand angel
a cloud angel floats by

spine of the mountain
stretches down to the car
from my tired feet

early morning moon
dissolves
into sky

stars obscured light
slips through blinds
across the street

ripe tomato sliced
seeds spill out
taste of summer

roots of the dead spruce
reach out bony fingers
secret life exposed

a dog's joy
riding in the back
of the pickup

spring shower
wet flakes drift down
settle into puddles

after the storm
the cornstalk scarecrow
his stuffing gone

on the deck
in the rain
her romance novel

rainless summer
in the water barrel
a family of mice

drooping fronds
of downstream willows
touch their own reflection

spring break
crocus pokes its head
through the melting of march

rustle of wind
the cornstalks
talk to each other

hunter's moon
two-legged shadows
over the fox hole

blue moon
on a cold spring night
skinny dippers

faint smile
framed in my memory
mona lisa

the ups
and downs of life
on the roller coaster

the man's arm descends
in a graceful arc
air guitar

radiant heater
a cat by the window
purrs

spring thaw
in the yard emerges
the lawn gnome

rainbow
in a child's hand
bunch of balloons

green willow curtain
draped over pond fragile trap
your hands reach for me

outside the glass bowl
emerald cat eyes mirror
somnolent goldfish

throaty frog chorus
harmonizing with crickets
warm spring night rising

moonlight pulses through
ebony and pearl dreamscape
nightmare fades to gray

echoes of sunset
your upturned face a canvas
splashed watercolor

golden afternoon
bees drunk on autumn apples
amber air humming

inside the hourglass
present made past grain by grain
sand without footprints

eventually
scars begin to speak us he
says as she traces

steam whisp up from mugs
cigarettes clutched in chapped lips
the dead awaken!

her skin line of music
acid-etched in gathering
darkness of the room

leaves from dying trees
a fire-wind drop through darkness
ascending the hill

from tree-shadow to
lighted pools startled koi paintbrush lines on water

sky's soft fragment brought
down around tailored shoulders
painting in autumnal fire

leaves soundless falling
to his work-gentled hands
weathered vein of hands

boy in soccer shirt
kicks broccoli piece
along grocery store aisle

the leaf
leaving the willow
his mother in his arms in the urn

snail trail
on backyard grass
neighbor yells at her son

coffee break
seagull drinks from rain
puddle

exchange
of wedding vows
the incoming tide

after disappointment
my face in the clouds in
car side mirror

the wind
under my clothes
a pelican's glide

driving past the cemetery
black stones
bright with sun

leaves fall into the river
drift by me
spectator to the parade

walking by the river
poplar leaves fall
perfect little boats

tree outside the window
turning gold
touched by midas

bowl of tomatoes
first hint of ripening
early dawn glow

green tomatoes
in a bowl
waiting for red

shelling the last peas
autumn chill cuts the air
summer bleeds

tickled smoke snaking
laps across swelter pavement
barbeque sidewalk

helicopter wings
churning air like weather vanes
world tides rise and fall

gray skewed sky dripping
some say dismal   some say
it is not frozen

frolicking light storm
glitter caked air   earth cover
winter saving face

smile amphibian
servile fly crowning frog prince
order among thieves

vain queen unrivalled
nymphs summon sea-god vengeance
cassiopeia

condensing rapture
one lip claps   tongue slipping
monosyllabic

tomorrow
a brand new haiku!
bated breath

reader sits
wishes this was a real poem
soon

haiku begins
sunday april 29th
new words new authors

new server new staff
soon you will begin to see
new haiku

we will miss you
farewell mr vonnegut
i laughed wept

submissions being
reviewed  they're all excellent
be patient count bees

snow dragging on
suicide watch starts

walking in the snow
i realize that i can't
erase my past deeds

crab crawling on sand
legs scattering leaving marks
gone in the morning

handsack gravy flake
forcive transistor goog fool
language is play yes?

april 1 is no joke
if you're already dead
or close to it

glasses on table
grandpa passed in june
only two months away

these young girls have
the legs and the walk
none of the bruises

trees still bare
stuck in november
t-shirts out in force

snow mold fading
green appearing potholes galore

manhole belching early
three hundred days of this
more to come

lots of drink down here
lots of skin too
new moon death

i have a book up here
south side of town
sands by the beach

plane ticket to france
like a fuck thou ode to you
if i had the balls

they sound like you
every word i'm gonna say
like jazz joints

i'd have breakfast
smashed in the bottle drowned
ghosting in lost

blessed relief
jackie was drunk again
making the best

axes raised bones thrown
suddenly a crazed dumb kid
god in the morning

crumpled jacket on
the back of your chair shows me
to whom you belong

tall black stilettos
fuck-me shoes back in fashion
stds rising

coarse white pubic hair
sign of fleeting time old age
now at the ready

blue-eyed blond school girl
luminous smile camouflage
for misshapen leg

pieces of puzzle
young boy studies shapes colors
picks framework of life

friends meet greet hug talk
try to stop relentless time
from cutting them short

spaniel run over
boy mourns his one and only
buddy his true friend

bright new mary-janes
lead journey to adulthood
first day of schooling

footprints red on white
near a vacant iron grin
that one got away

bursts over belt loops
designer brand across her ass
guess what? your weight?

relentless rush
sliding over senseless stone
the tide dancing

spilling mica flecks
across cooling velvet as
the sun sulks away

minus thirty with
white wraiths leaping road shoulders
glad i’m not walking

bedraggled wagon
wet glass under overpass
tires walk on water

with all words broken
wails empty to ragged breaths
apocalyphons

she speaks in circles
will you tell me a story?
means do you love me?

to touch be touched
is everything worth wanting
yes there and yes that

all we did was talk
but i can smell you on me
smoke and seduction

snow freezing rain snow
winter teaches us patience
tulips daffodils

my cat purrs comfort
rearranging my sock drawer
for dapper white feet

i’d dance on his grave
if i could just remember
where i’d buried him

my whole family
is in therapy for things
we don’t talk about

life is hot amber
but what flows when all things end?
just truth  and ice

mountains but not stone
white sculptures too pure for hands
i break like a wave

how do they return
those who die beneath the snows?
storm petrel   sheathbill

poured glass   mute valley
ice creaks on rusty hinges
weight of a white tongue

snow falls like feathers
down to diamonds pressed tight
no room for a soul

lucid awe-struck blue
traps the voice leaves it hollow
falling faces roar

ice is poetry
blunt punctuation hard thoughts
words  sharp as angles

time with a purpose
makes up for what disappears
when the clock runs down

a photo is all
we have of our rendezvous
between here and there

this late-night movie
is not as satisfying
as what will come next

beyond the river
three abandoned cabins wait
for erosion’s grasp

five try to study
during breaks as they drink
laugh cough smoke and sit

brandishing her phone
a solo conversation
fills the moving bus

i took some pictures
and ended up on the front
lines of a movement

deadline looming
this haiku isn’t as good
as it could have been

snow on the ground
streetlamps are on
at four o'clock

cryllic spullilick
just remember to roll yr я’s
or is it a ya?

another sunless day
i don't go outside anyhow
what's the point?

hangover again
feel ashamed and broken down
you bring the vodka tonight?

still drunk from last night
morning train into moscow
what a wonderful world

just
sitting
around

immaculate snow
muffles cries camouflages
city’s shortcomings

still white cityscape
belies fury of last night's
edmonton blizzard

canadian rockies
hold secrets hopes fossils in
ranges of tight pleats

man walks dog daily
past woman at her window
order in their world

sparkling wrist bangles
call crystalline air to bear
witness to spirit

the sun's luscious lips
kiss my nape like a lover's
promise of pleasure

buds hands hail the sun
a spring in pedestrians' steps
alberta chinook

flavor sensation
soma in my soylent green
numb i keep eating

luminescent lures
draw them close to its dark mouth
the nightclub swallows

iron pachyderms
rake the soil as if to say
asphalt goes here

gently falling down
tucks in the filth and refuse
cold comfort drifting

sharp stone fingers
pulling tissue to tatters
mountains clutching sky

he'll sleep here again
despite the wendigo chill
pawing through his coat

warm mechanism
of love at rest becoming rage
bodies colliding

every storm passes
the world remembers to breathe
rainbows are promises

lightning eyes flashing
and your face darkens and clouds
thunder comes after

organic fair trade
fresh-ground french-pressed coffee
cup of privilege

hard-faced women
complaining into cell phones
missing the sunset

mercury dropping
bus now forty minutes late
i want to go home

treachery afoot
churned oatmeal over ice
avoid the alley

old friends surfacing
vancouver norway taiwan
happy holidays

dance twirls a bright blade
cleaves deep through fabric   soft flesh
presses heart to heart

quick steps on hard wood
a racing heart   shadow hips
scream of passing skin

red satin   legs twine
dart quick as smoky heels meet
smolder freeze tango

slow twilight fluid
sweat and heat and bodies pass
eyes flash fire  rumba

snowflakes   melting tears
smooth spinning vienna night
pressed tight   frozen eyes

wings shift cold clear air
softly beat in three four time
waltz  a heart takes flight

dance drips with red ink
bodies paint dreams on blank wood
floor slick with desire

bring me a latte
whole milk extra hot with foam
to keep me thinking

winter is a birth
of lofty expectations
for the next season

this pen is too small
for the breadth of my fingers
or the words they speak

i turned off my phone
darkness should equal silence
except in my dreams

she doesn't live here
moved out before the increase
in rent and constraints

breathing in the scent
of life and food and romance
air is recycled

staring at pictures
digitized upon the screen
high-tech memories

who is this butcher?
grinning whiskey on his breath
russian dentist’s chair

elton john sings
a texas love song as
first snow falls

shitfaced with your dad
though no two words are understood
the cognac does its job

highway prostitute
shivering in snowy cold
all i can see is your breath

long weekend 4th class
8-hour night train to smolensk
это сущий разврат this is a veritable debauch

train station at dawn
a million foreign faces pass me by
you were never on time

lada in the rain
wrapped in a blanket of flame
unquenchable thirst

spotty memories
dot minds alzheimer rubs out
the connecting lines

time flows freely like
water in a river no
dam can hold it back

shingles jolts of pain
zigzag stitches on his back
life’s calligraphy

furious sparrows
beak to beak flash wings draw lines
upon patio

shovel of dirt hits
father’s casket and her heart
fall leaves winter’s here

endless prairie sky
nowhere to hang memories
only beginnings

cold gray october
clammy cloak of memories
father’s burial

deep inhalation
tasting this crisp autumn day
i’d kill for a smoke

dusk rain surrenders
bright clouds bleed a war-red
kurosawa sky

ghost-metal hull
steams to break the horizon
and evapourates

torn plastic petals
trash-bag blossom on the lawn
all the damned magpies

concrete pilings
with rust-stained ends and rebar
old broken bones

wet air and streets
painted glass-black with water
you left this morning

blacktop tigers
menace pedestrians
with glass-packed snarls

winter dark mornings
dragging my ass out of bed
before the sun does

in the hour of foxes
shadows slip and slink around
edges of perception

whyte ave homeless man
compliments my sexy shoes
no change  shame on me

such shallow concerns
my lip balm discontinued
dread finding new brand

wow the man says wow
falling off his bicycle
good morning to you

a kindred magpie
we hoard all the shiny bits
with raucous laughter

black umbrellas bloom
dozens under autumn rains
one twirling paisley

hiroshima blooms
on a dark day in august
five petals falling

flesh gnaws at its chains
tainted souls dance in rubble
echoes murmur in the skin

dark streaks on concrete
black rain washes the gutters
poison in the wound

towers torn to dust
carried to the firmament
by a crushing fist

the air is on fire
hades belches furies dance
buildings melt like wax

white light in the sky
the face of god shinesbright hot
a killing whisper

a speck in the blue
dodging the pale clouds   guilt builds
on a quiet day

the cup is empty
bringing on the dilemma
of a refill or exit

graying sky soaring
a roof above the heads of
mortal creatures beneath

all it takes is a
spot of sun drop of love
for a complete day

before the harvest
temperatures dropped below
enough to finish growth

marching in unison
crying out the calls for peace
my camera is my banner

aching shoulders call
for a break from plasma screens
keyboards and deadlines

drugged up on caffeine
floating between sleep and day
pouring out the words

confusion at the deli
ya ne gavaroo pa-russky
please don’t shout at me

familiar photos on the wall
remind me of who i am
but who the fuck are they?

mud on my pant cuffs
can’t take a step around here
without a wrong one

babushka keenly watches
young boy’s
first attempt at beer

one bedroom roach motel
windows let in the cold
i’m far from home

children playing
yelling in a language
i cannot understand

silky hands of youth
caress old parchment faces
grandchildren delight

fall’s blaze of folly
deposits rich red blood cells
on winter’s bare bones

family pictures
phone calls elderly people’s
spindly bones of hope

your aftershave climbs
the stairs ahead of your steps
i inhale pleasure

desert wind throws sand
wipes steps whips hair and welts dunes
rubs out man’s imprint

lavender bath oil
anoints all her crevices
washing him away

a soldier’s parents
answer call from ottawa
hoping for wounded

a suckling pig
better your head in my lap
than in my freezer

iridescence
painting color in the moist air
clouds weeping prisms

his snake eyes mirthful
death drives a black ambulance
hands at ten and two

slick scales defy
deft fingers fishing for answers
the question swims off

tall cool amber brew
wonderful sense-deadening
comfort in decay

a milk-blue sky stretches
taut on the city’s bones
until concrete gasps

aching fingers spill
stillborn prose to stain these leaves
rough thoughts slouching off

cloud-wrapped swaddling
infant sky after sunrise
pale blue and pale pink

freshly shaved legs
and washed my sheets today
going to bed bliss

tracks end wingswept slashes
splattering blood against snow
here death from above

it smells of spoiled
fish and feels like death or
thunder waiting to break

july afternoon
city sky darkens with smoke
from distant wildfires

cheer up emo kid
no shrug scowl and walk away
i feel like brooding

office refugees
exclaim over marigolds
as though miracles

the sky breaks open
it had to happen sometime
why not now?

the smell of wet earth
streetlight halos in the rain
yukatta raincoat

alone on a hill
miles of angry brilliance
nothing but a point

the taste of wet air
and the sagging weight of clouds
hang damp on my skin

thunder hangs on the
prairie dances in the darkness
breaks and howls white light

waiting for lightning
drinking up the flat black clouds
trying not to blink

i can taste the storm
with its dark wings and bright eyes
moving the heavy air

grassy field
entices the sparrow’s flight
to the ground

no washrooms anywhere
crouching behind a tree
i can hear everything now

leaves in my teacup
float helplessly in the sea
i stir with my spoon

pedaling over
a gravel road unpavedwe crossed a bridge

strumming the guitar
i was given as a present
sounds familiar

i photographed a
chipmunk running on the fence
where the wood had split

open notebook
confronts me with its blankness
my pen is a dare

yellow carpet
of choked leaves
my feet are sore

burned trees among
the fading living
reminder

blue wind pushes forth
bugs are somewhere
and nowhere

bison are elegant
they should be sipping cocktails
wearing tuxedos

rain clouds move in
cool north wind makes
coyotes smirk

buzzing hornets
cannot stop leaves
from hitting ground

burning down white water
logdriver is so not cool
he's no brando

ephemera
that which cannot be touched
should not matter

drowning in whiskey
she left again
and keeps leaving

horsehair whips and torture
cowboy kisses the wrong girl
for the tenth time

god sweeping up
leaves rustle on pavement
move to the gutter

restless turning
funnel of air
in my bedroom

small beetle on my step
moving with intent
crushed by my heel

a fall sunday
sits in my lap
october waits

buddha in the rain
useless statue sips his tea
he is stone quiet

coffee with buddha
i talk about my worries
his dick-ass smile

my daughter makes dolls
draws and colors and names them
while bombs in beirut

chipmunk on the deck
terrified can’t find its way
this i understand

stepping stones vanish
the garden makes final moves
i accept what is

sunflowers rising
poke their heads above the fence
they see fall coming

compassion working
it is me who makes it real
buddha meaningless

burnt tree trunks
stop stretching skyward
start standing still

broken umbrellas
young women's hats-flattened
cormorant weather

city spruce cones
cocooned in spring ice
fall unopened

first brown bat of spring
barks through the blue dusk crane flies?
bring me the sphinx moths!

may dusk black outlines
of bare tamaracks-broken
under winter's cloak

april evenings
still air-mosquitoes slumber
unfolding

unseen geese call
to each other-to the flags
snapping below

dead bird under window
maybe found its clearer brighter place
after all

corner store
spider's built a web
across the butterfly nets

vacant lot
streetlights shine up at me
from a broken mirror

i love the colors trees turn
but not yet

boy in dentist chair screams
mom stands in waiting room
hands over her mouth

some idiot with a campfire up in the trees
but the smoke smells good
like a hundred childhood mornings

leaning on the window
rainclouds read over my shoulder

mail delivery
today the sound of the dog
not barking

crescent moon
still i turn my gaze back
to the muddied path

splash!
ripples stir
the moon's reflection

wine glasses touch
the top button of her blouse
not yet undone

campfire talk
moths flutter in and out
of the shadows

where only yesterday
i heard the owl's mating call
golden leaves

meditation class
for the first time he contemplates
his own navel

pinholes for sleep
stretched across
a dirty sheet

good night fair city
your belly button sex drive
makes me fucking sick

across plains we flew
in memoriam of you
love's labors anew

summer
on the beach
and pablo neruda

a 12 year old bomb
makes his way into market
both are made fools

boz scaggs
good singer
bad fashion

baroness undresses
flashes her boobs
hounds wail in the rain

a garden of weeds
fed by dry heat and neglect
is still a garden

trying to tune in
a song of the soul but my
reception is bad

bill's eyes blue-bird blue
his sweet old leaky raincoat
yellow-cab yellow

pennies on your eyes
last of the big-time spenders
i guess we'll miss you

the streets are filled with
lonely people and litter
sure just toss me there

my hair looks grayer
in the autumn morning light
mirrors can be cruel

there is no escape
the stars are moving closer
might as well get drunk

she is temptation
this dark-haired lurking beauty
i would miss this ache

not willing to leave
this imperfect nest this bird
has so much to learn

this summer garden
a convoluted chaos
simplicity mislaid

this lobelia
pink purple blue orgasm
--need a cigarette

her black kimono
opens reveals just enough
it’s never enough

out of the sweatlodge
into the cool mountain night
humbled by starlight

parents’ ugly spat
will she remember this fight
when she’s eleven?

erotic tingling
married japanese woman
cleans my teeth gently

starlings gossip
amused at our lovemaking
the quivering limbs

desperate over you
when you stand off-over eggs
over nothing

sunset-a wing
of urine-soaked
swan feathers

what was i doing?
collecting ephemera?
for what?

no poems in a month
every metaphor sixth rate
too many lost words maybe

that stained journal
abandoned how like mourning
her black ink

sidewalk roses windows
into more fragrant and colorful worlds

sleep-colored
tires on asphalt

no awning
only an umbrella
for the flower vendor

more rain
the cat shreds another
paper bag

leaf-man runs
sees me watching
stops and lies flat

cigarette butt smoking on the sidewalk
ants gather around
a new religion has begun

falling leaf
takes some of the sun
early to the ground

drifting leavesa street vendor hawks
his poems

winter chillaround the windy corner
surprise! full moon

tea ceremonysteam clouds up
my glasses

divorce proceedingsthings hers not his
his not hers

lakeside tai chi
i wave hands as clouds while
the phoebe catches flies

the rhythmic tapping
of my hiking sticka thrush sings melody

river valley walka single leaf floating
on turbulent waters

only one thing beats
watching diane dance her red
boots under my bed

water into wine
every time you look at me
my girl parts get drunk

funny you still want
all this time alone with me
these words are all wrong

ten years sober 'till
who the hell invited you?
more tequila please

hard to say sorry
when you don't know what you did
that was so awful

callie's back in town
that means lagers and flirting
at the irish pub

grandfather's cologne
pipe tobacco peppermints
and ivory soap

won't you meet
my hound dog
temperance

midnight
bats are diving
it's hot she says

delicate toes
behind sandal straps
winking an invitation

guitar concert
three thousand people
strumming and believing

sunburned neck
mosquito humming
on my sleeve

family reunion
food from heaven
uncle falls down

canada day
burst of fireworks
sparkle and gone

these mountains are slow
breath is frozen this morning
tentative new green

whiskey and cigars
perfect companions for this
mountainous refuge

reworking the book
journey again through despair
to the other side

radio hockey game
journey to mountains by car
perfect word pictures

i watch green return
this bathroom window check a
shower ritual

there is nothing wrong
with me nothing wrong with me
nothing wrong is there?

may comes dismal and sad
the lawn is white this morning
chickadees confused

who wanders the valley
this late at night? just us
matching footsteps

spring football players
pop and hustle grunting
yearless fatter

the japanese man
who picks the dumpster bottles
early this morning

street priest's heel gashed wide
on broken windows limping
late for the graveyard

bellhops gibber
watch smoking vagrants
jealous-like

she's a big fucking
dump of snow he says chewing
the rim of his coffee cup

one-eyed stumbler killed
while fishing off the bus curb
for cigarette butts

leaf in the morning
lying on damp soil holding
dewdrops for the ants

a thousand lonely writers
- the bookstore is empty

the air is heavy with spruce and humidity
and your airplane flying away

raindropped carragana branch
leaves a handprint on my sleeve

picture window
weeping birch with new leaves
purple and gray pigeon with broken neck

i walk and a robin flies
behind a restaurant
through the soft greasy air

cranes over lakeshore
each takes its own reflection
away from the waves

rejection slipthe postman's footprints
in the snow

alone tonighthow blue
the moonlit iris

spring flood
a single leaf floats
on turbulent waters

all along whyte ave
a fresh bloom
of bellybuttons

yellow daisies
surround the weathered benchgramdma's storytime

this horse and i
for different reasons we gaze
at the delpheniums

a hummingbird sips
from a scarlet gilathe touch of her breast

asshole questioning
doesn't know about haiku
5-7-5 bitch

the clouds open up
a halo of rain downpour
your lips glistening

morning cup coffee
she smiles at me sweetly
across the table

fly nearer the sun
icarian suicide
celebrity a

poems writ on gold
finally having value
throw this one away

love like a blossom
sweet and floral on the wind
all too soon faded

sun kill moon
across a desert expanse
sky runs blood red

stanley cup puckheads
slapshots in their dna
raw zamboni lust

luggage gone astray
'welcome home' from purring cat
the best elixir

day five in paris
dog shit on both pairs of shoes
still it beats working

under the van gogh
starry night is too cliche
let's make it renoir

i want one hard kiss
one barefoot dance in paris
when the lights go out

afternoon buses
powered by junior high fear
ipods and hormones

bad start to the day
mister potatohead's eye
in my alpha-bits

her eyes want and you
trump this need with your desire
buddhist fails again

curvaceous woman
vibrates at the edge of you
a dark sultry lie

you slap her ass hard
erratic staggered and loud
what’s next? she’s thinking

dark skinned beauty moves
hot vibrating blue rhythm
match tip explodes red

she loves you on her
day off takes you in her flat
blue single bed bliss

highway deer unsure
one slips-almost-falls skitters
across ashphalt hell

in the gentle rain
people walking by the elms
they do not look up

the white haired bums
stand in solidarity
as the casket drops

fading oil worker
bedded now and filled with tar
counting his regrets

walking in the cold
the long metal bridge
endless in the night

jubilant drunk waves
his partner  cradles the bottle
nods good evening

poor artist studios
full of late night hopefuls
immune to failure

street lights shining blue
spinster pops the lid off
a cold beer after midnight

smell of fish sticks
and coffee  the evening shift
is taking lunch

spring
warm air again
through taxi windows

rain red cobblestone puddles
twitching into circles

cushion in the branches of a tree
meditation seat
for a weightless monk

dolphin breaks the surface
dives again
a forgotten daydream

where we were is mist
where we're going is mist
only this place

fish heads on sidewalk
what conversations

butterflies in vacant lot flowers
don't they hear the thunder?

once purple
the gray thistle bends
toward earth

meditation class
he begins by contemplating
the blonde's navel

lucky moon
even when waning
no one replaces you

midday hush
the rasp of a mallard
calling his mate

rain shower
too big to squeeze
between the drops

spring sun
cedar waxwings fill
the leafless plum

garage cleaning day
my father's fishing pole
coated with dust

clown and machete
a birthday party from hell
more cake anyone?

paul mccartney
a conspiracy theory
he's really a douche

cut out that chit chat
rich people got madd problems

i let a rainbow trout
off the hook

city skyscape
a palm tree shimmies amidst
construction cranes

prairie dawn
above a buffalo herd
slowly rising steam

waning moon
her half cup bra
slung over the chair

reminding myself
how colorful they are
bagging fallen leaves

on the lake
a stiff breeze adds crests
to half the birds

yard sale
the venus de milo
marked as is

nude beach
a man and a woman
collect shells

midday sun
a tree frog on the french door
turns translucent

writing letters home
a yellow eyed cat hunts moths
beneath the lantern

the neighbor
wanting a fence just like
the neighbor's

eyelash moon
the cobalt sky
holds her silence

trying not to look again
she adjusts her blouse v

with my finger
i trace the delicate pattern
lace wing butterfly

thistle field
nothing sticks to
the stone buddha

surrounding
the quiet bungalow
yellow crime scene tape

raining sunset
a rainbow fades
into the horizon

the shallows
waves run in
on tiny feet

thunderstorms
tadpoles swimming
in my porch

cottonwood
a plastic dump truck
in the freckled shade

after his death
the peace lily
blooms again

a blonde girl wearing
a pink skirt on a blue bike
willed the red light green

carnival
feeling the seam
of my empty pocket

abandoned dog
looking at the face
of every pedestrian

muddy trail
deep footprints
filling with rain

withered near the fountain
a sunflower dips its head

pulsing sea jellies
a symphony orchestra
on mute

along this block
of elm street
linden blossoms

murmuring voices
along the shoreline
smelters' lanterns

star filled night
a wandering coyote sleeps
in a trash can

empty bus stop
the song of crickets
becomes stronger

seagrass
a folded ochre star
in the tidepool

a long fly ball
arcs above the moon
summer deepens

cold mist
only the mourning doves
have voices

roadside field
barbed wire fence
leaning into mist

six ants
come out of his laptop
summer school

busy weekend
a withered leaf falls
beside the broom

the old cat
sniffs and paws
its photograph

stiff wind
the bull bares
his teeth

ball three
the manager's foot
on the dugout steps

white cloud gliding
over the mirrored lake
ibis dips a wingtip

school garden
sunflower bowing
under a crow's weight

crossing the stream
on the next stepping stone
a tiny frog

calm lake
even the canoeist
is still

orange sunrise
birds fly in formation
above an empty beach

art gallery
the rustle of her skirt
on the staircase

first rain
the bright colors
of her summer top

bombs in london
my wife calls her brother
just to hear his voice

summer weekend
mist on my face
from the crop duster

old brothel
a for sale sign
atop another

fragrant breeze
kids rush in to sell roses
at the traffic signals

lupine
a darker blue
in the hoofprints

the dog
returning in his mouth
a different stick

bed rest
a spider crosses the ceiling
in eight seconds flat

desert funeral
a dead cactus still
bears its thorns

moon shadow
the pyracantha grows
across the floor

he brings to the
picnic table a jar
of fireflies

lost in a field
of sunflowers
the sun

hurricane season
a pair of cranes walk
against the wind

taking front stage
a moth circles
the spotlight

morning sunlight
the sound of rain
on the marsh

darkening sky
the snake curves
into my path

fresh iguana stew
with the last warm tortilla
mopping the tureen

did i drop something
i bend over to pick up
a patch of moonlight

june bug
memories of a
childhood friend

renaissance faire
a knight in armor
hides his cell phone

summer downpour
next door the kids
keep playing

afternoon heat
the slow blink of
the bullfrog's eyes

hail storm
tiny white balls
bounce on the deck

glittering
in the puddle
a brand new dime

a small pink blossom
floating in a clear glass bowl
how alone we are

a boy naps
dust devils spin
down the lane

the red horizon
in puddles darkened
street

ragged leaf
the yellow grasshopper's
missing leg

lighthouse field
a kite filled sky
tugs at the earth

the butterfly
touches me with her
orange color

hot bright day
clop clopping in the street
a policeman's horse

in today's headlines
fresh catch of the day

outdoor concert
the mosquitoes off-key

etched in tree bark
the names of lovers
no longer in love

red dragonfly
redder still
this sunset

white petals
the smell of flowers
over the tomb

red grapes
the many hands it took
to bring them to this table

low tide
the smell of seaweed
and her chanel no 5

windless afternoon
at the temple gate
the wind god's stare

hollow cello case
low notes and the
rhythm of us

strains of the violin
the old man walks to
his own rhythm

early morning
reflected in the lake
another city

summer gusts
the outdoor furniture
rearranged

saturday morning
biking to the park
the click of marbles

black on black
the tombstone's shadow
on the widow's dress

early sun
the red-wing glides
into shade

windy night
a solitary cricket
chirps at the stars

abandoned stable
wild roses bloom along
the split rail fence

moonless night
the smell of the pond
in the bull frog’s cry

pitching horseshoes
after the storm
a double rainbow

desert sunrise
the beat of
butterfly wings

the wait to take
a driving test
ants on the sidewalk

in the gravel
along the railroad tracks
pussy willows

writing with strands of
watery hair on her bare back
a love haiku

brown thrush
those long legs
lost in clover

birthday balloons
the one that doesn't burst
blows away

hiss of leaves
washing snaps
on the line

a kaleidoscope
prisms of you turning
into river water

new shower gel
my thoughts
still dirty

down the mountain
lost mitten lying palm up
on the trail

at the newsstand
today’s truths stacked up
taller than me

planter's moon
the milk white arc
of her nine month belly

easter
the lost bookmark
in the bible reappears

moon viewing party
the moon arrives late

spring thaw
the crow pecks
at its shadow

do not enter tape
lifting in the spring breeze
the gate opened wide

entwined
this thought of spring
rises with the moon

zen garden
the monk's shadow
the monk himself

spring cleaning
bouncing from the pavement
steady rain

flowering pear tree
a trail of white petals
tracing the wind

poui blossoms fall
i am torn between
looking up and down

lingering cold
both hands surround my
battered tea mug

stillness
along this snowpacked road
noises of small birds

high tide
he casts his fishing line
into the darkness

crescent moon
the vendor slices
a melon

fading light
rain overflows
the gutter

jazz singer's solo
the length of her
blue dress

quiet morning
some of the fence
still standing

rush hour
the ticket taker's
shaking hands

a snail dallies
under a leaf
empty mailbox

a fly on the creamer
so i drink my coffee black
sunday morning brunch

clearing fog
reds yellows and blues
dot the sled hill

playground rain
a white chalk heart
washes away

hospice lounge
the newspaper
three days old

hearth light
dad's shadow sharpens
against the frosted window

long winter's night
we turn the covers
down together

the greenhouse
on the seed catalogue
a half eaten red apple

winter midnight
a fresh foot of snow
lightens the sky

blizzard
in my headlights
ten thousand flakes

new moon
an empty hollow on your
side of the bed

bobbing up and down
an empty perrier bottle
in a stagnant pool

fireplace
the last glow
from grandpa's tree

snowfall
a child draws the horizon
on a window

jicarita peak
fading light favors
the silver fox

winter calmness
even on the child's see-saw
an even coat of snow

lattice window
the lacemaker pauses
to gaze at the moon

snow viewing
the raven tumbles
down the hill

morninglight
this slant of snow
against the window

black out
bright lit
amish windows

playing army
the little boys fight
over who's dead

winter evening
home from the party
my red dress on the floor

from the cabin doorway
glancing at mount fuji
for a thousand years

by the pasture fence
snowflakes melt in
my lover's hand

news of a death
snowflakes falling
past the window

first snow
the spider is evicted
from my boot

wind and winter rain
the bus shelter
chatters

serpentine
the city rain
down the sooted windowpane

rolling gray fog
a boat disappears
with a wave

typhoon
the bells tolling
by themselves

my last day at work
in the forecast
freezing rain

hospital entrance
rain trickles
down the ivy

after the moth
moonlight drifts through
an empty web

martha goldmine
rising from the tailings pond
a gaggle of geese

afternoon class
a corner darkens
near the sunlight

first frost
even the green
leaves fall

in my solitude
through the brick work
this one bright star

frosty morning
across the paddock
dog's paw prints

returning home
three hours older
clock strikes twelve

conversation lags
far out on the spindly branch
a withered leaf

wind at dusk
between fallen leaves
a pigeon's feather

a fishbowl
lit by reflected light
from a pond

final prayers
smoke hanging
in the air

leaping salmon
sunlight falls
to the rocks

hurricane warning
in the uncanny stillness
a hazy sunset

game preserve
newly-planted trees
these empty drink cans

autumn mists
the mountain
disappears

where are they now
my mother and father
in last night's dream

broken cup
the moon reappears
in a puddle of tea

through a corridor
of wind humbled trees
i walk toward mr lincoln

well dressed mannequins
i turn up the collar
of my old coat

through the window
sparrows wage war
over breadcrumbs

autumn afternoon
all around the duck pond
shotgun shells

the wind and the kids
the kids and the wind
all the way home

home from the steel warehouse
dad's lunchbox filled
with baseball cards

autumn dusk
a cigarette smolders
on the sidewalk

wind whipped lake
one yellow maple leaf
riding the waves

off season
the fair grounds
filled with wind

raindrop circles
in the bird bath
eating alone

music box
an old man holding
his wedding picture

red tail lights
i decide we're going
to eat takeout

morning paper
scrolling down the page
to click on more

autumn night
my breath passes through
the porch screen

squadrons of crows
returning from the fields
setting sun

great gusts of wind
sweep through yosemite valley
autumn leaves falling

my cousin's granddaughters
flirt with me
at his funeral

eating tangerines
while i listen
to you shower

morning's stillness
the moon bright white
over the street lamps

estate sale
the rake lies untouched
among brown leaves

empty parking lot
under fluorescent streetlight
palm tree shadows

near the easel
curled tubes of burnt umber
last cicada call

tide pool
the sea anemone
closes on a finger

autumn loneliness
the last green tomato
falls from the vine

your farewell
gift of chocolates
i taste you once a day

a hesitation
in the way the branches blow
harvest moonrise

stone church
graffitied on its wall
a broken heart

first colored leaves
boatmen on the river
ship their oars

red hibiscus grows
through the twisted chain link fence
after the typhoon

manhattan sunset
the street magician's
first trick

summer ends
turning the last page
of a book

passing clouds
the horizon blurred
in summer rain

sultry night
the thin white stripe left
by a spaghetti strap

suddenly parting
the billowed curtains release
a late summer breeze

garbage pickup
the tree lawn strewn
with candy wrappers

accompanied
by a cloud
of seagulls

blush of dusk on the lake
goose wings slap the surface

in the rafters
a barn owl
dances

on the spot
where the old lighthouse stood
moonflowers

a blackout
no light remains
except the moon

since her death
only sparrows visit
the pigeon lady's house

all i saw of the bird
was the bouncing branch
he left

a maple seed
helicopters onto
the blacktop

flower market
sunflowers facing
the ocean

forgotten temple
a yellow flower
offers itself

summer feast
a swarm of grasshoppers
on the gladiolas

temple of zeus
in bright light
a stone carved flower

the dunk tank clown
dries off

midway lightning
the funnel cake vendor
draws his awning

the brightness
of this room

under the magnifying glass
a ladybird's tears

what a yellow
against the concrete
the yellow flower

friday the 13th
the clang of the farrier's
rounding hammer

athens wind
the fish market
the incense vendor

summer drought
next to her rose tattoo
a pale blue vein

pears on the sill
blushing behind
lace curtains

back and forth
leaf shadow weaves
over the loom

silent forest
hikers wear bells
to frighten bears

abundant sunshine
a praying mantis
guards a rose bush

not even a cat
in sight

kite's aloft
the young boy pulls free
of his father's hand

rolling on its back
in a freshly mown paddock
a white horse

daylight moon
faded chalk stars
on the sidewalk

sunset garden
the dust of peaches
and baby's breath

a waitress
refills the sugar
the long day

hiking alone
telephone wires bridging
the river

below the waterfall
her tresses a waterfall
over her bodice

a half-submerged log
rests in an emerald pool
waterfall downstream

morning haze
mosquitoes rise
from the lake

summer heat
a willow tree dips
into the pond

wading upstream
looking for the
waters' past

we walk upstream
sharing the river
snag herons and shags

lime quarter
an icecube collapses
over jazz

in dust and heat
brow sweat trickles
pungent hyssop

another sunset
still by the seashore a girl
and an empty chair

summer grasses
an old blue car
without doors

inter city train journey
a rattling window top
shuts itself

heat wave
even the windmill
is lazy

twin pines
only the moon
between them

eel grass wriggling
with the current

wildflowers
the sun rises on
a thousand droplets

midnight beach
a wave breaks
through the dark

one barb of the wire
tiny web catching dew

summer twilight
sampling the peaches
at a roadside stand

late sun
a dandelion wisp
floats into shade

there must be a sound
to silence the river chatter
i expect the crickets know

morning tai chi
pet dog watches
my every step

faroff boat whistle
i close the loop
of my embroidery thread

dawn cuckoo
after cuckoo
after cuckoo

lemon blossoms
freshly laundered shirts
on the clothesline

worn driftwood
a bird the river has carved
above the falls

summer garden wedding
the bridal procession swelled
by uninvited ducks

lunch in the park
dripping hot dog relish
on a pigeon's head

shimmering
a rainbow in the lake
upside down

bolting from the curb
a squirrel disappears
into traffic

vanishing koi
at the bottom of the pond
a cloud of silt

truancy
a group of noisy sparrows
at the museum entrance

in twin
the crickets
midnight clicks

sunrise at camp
herons in flight
i raise my coffee cup

scale cloud
sunlight deepens
the stone buddha

yard decorations
my sister's clothes
on the scarecrow

trying to escape
through the garden mirror

what the raven
found obscured

penciled on drywall

of an english muffin

on the grass
she cut yesterday
apple blossoms

anniversary
of her suicide
rain rain rain

morning in may
raindrops scribble
on the window panes

swiftly
down a newly paved road
the moon on a rim of haze

beside my piano bench
a spider steps
up and up

marathon
a full moon
in every puddle

red kite
the sound of your fabric
in the tree

sunny day
flowers of the funeral wreath
all yellow

mist
the heron balanced
on its reflection

spring cleaning
the thin layer of dust
on my glasses

nothing but a dumpster
and that brilliant azalea
blooming beside it

rain drops
falling upon the yellow rose
my gaze

mute button
the unexpected sound
of raindrops

under an eave
small white shard
of a broken egg

mowing the lawn
spring's first daisy
peeking through the grass

six am
my shadow running
across all six lanes

spring winds
the grassland
waving

daffodils bow
thoughts of
hiroshima

sea breeze
the light green
of a plum blossom

weighted blooms
terrace blanketed
in white

morning mist
an echo from the other side
of the forest lake

cutting biscuits
spring sun through
the blinds

break time
the glassblower drinks
a canned pepsi

in the sunshine
snatches of conversation
lowing of cows

my roses budding
this year i won't be here
to see them bloom

the green lawn
dotted with plum tree blossoms
spring rains

sunlit
finches split
morning fog

cold spring night
a line of distant fires
above the dune

cleaning up
after the storm
all the ants cleaning up

downpour
the barber shaves
himself

spring sky
a toddler walks outside
in a blue cowboy hat

spring morning
the breeze in her one
curl of hair

spring cleaning
leaving the rosin
on papa's fiddle

wind and rain
just a gull and i
at the ferry landing

morning mist drifts
as the night stars
disappear

first tree buds
the list of baby names
not chosen

frenetic day
outside my office window
clouds slowly drift

two year old
starting pennies
from seed

discarded hubcap
two sparrows bathing
after the rain

cloudburst
flecks of sun
on a thorn bush

on the sixty year old headstone
one daffodil

chirping of sparrows
morning sunrays on the buddha
in the temple

window view
swaying green tree fronds
in cloud filled sky

from the east
rain moving in
slick casket handles

a film of mist
between my eyes
and her eyes

at the end of a blind date
the soft clicking of
our eyeglass frames

just enough silence
to make the crows
scream

at the movies
little kids watch
each other

winter sky
along the power line
a black contrail

winter surf
seagrass bristles
on the dune

cold night
the street vendor hands me
a roasted chestnut

pitch black
moving toward her lips
i kiss her nose

business trip ending
my shadow pulls a briefcase
from the car trunk

february moon
lovers walk on the dark side
of the street

ghost town
outside the saloon
parked trucks

evening shadows
part of the moon
covered in a haze

winter carnival
a thin frost sparkles on the
ice carver's beard

year of the monkey
the curved fingers of
the back scratcher

winter sunrise
the orange sky
scored by branches

winter sun
warming the mailbox
a friend's letter

tree ice
sunlight inches down
the bedroom chair

midwinter
the bird's injured
left wing

february 1st
working inside all day long
i forget the sky

night rain
between the wind chimes
thunder

winter moon
the hustler chalks his cue stick
with a flourish

winter gale
drawing the haiku boulder
without light or shade

looking out the window
the sun and moon
exchange places

windswept
beyond the rippled snow
the rippled lake

with a blow torch
writing haiku
in the snow

winter drizzle
her pink umbrella fighting
with the wind

beer forgotten
the drunk looks deep
within his shoe

wood smoke
on cold still air
last crescent

gale warning
two gulls surf the waves
above the lake

a white owl
settles on the telephone pole
snowflakes swirl

winter morning
remains of a candle inside
the snowball lantern

a little sick today
several geese clear the mountain
before i count them

sunday rain
a shadow of the mountain
behind mist

still snowing
can't see where i
walked last night

using an expression
my father used
understanding it

snowmobile tracks
disappear behind the trees
full moon tonight

from icicles
water and moonlight
dripping

winterness
even without the wind
the chill

bright new years moon
the cloud passes quickly by

counting breaths
or not counting cockscombs
poets come and go

evening sky
on the village roofs
falls a dark snow

stars on my coat
from the winter sky

early morning
the tips of the evergreen
touched with light

corner of the house
so sharp the cut
wind shrieks

on the birches
as if for them alone
silver moonlight

winter fog
no snow on
the ground

christmas ornaments
a jolly buddha
bends a branch

december morning
my neighbor ties blue balloons
to her front porch

winter moon
the sea laps at
old tide marks

full moon
all of the cats on the roof
appear white

chopping block
cook and cod exchange
a long look

after the winter
rain brown garden
drips with birds

cold wind
through the el station
the old bluesman’s harp

bare cottonwoods
in wind streaked sky
last spring's nest

kitchen skylight
in my lunchtime soup
moon and noodles

after the argument
in the kitchen gouging out
the potatoes' eyes

end of autumn
finding myself in a
field of thistle

stormy night
lightning outlines
our bodies

enjoying autumn stillness
the measured clatter
of my clogs

wild fires
only chimneys
in the culdesac

small talk
a few leaves remain
in the trees

light morning frost
fills the old footprints
in the concrete walk

on the table
where the book sat
a clean spot

still can't sleep
standing in the driveway
the gibbous moon

who can tell
from which tree they come
autumn wind

autumn sapling
all twelve leaves
orange

lighted fireplace
between each log
shifting darkness

in the dust
under my bed
a lost blindfold

floodlight catches
two masked thieves
through the rain

autumn fish market
all in a line
eyes toward the sea

reading something
in the autumn wind
dry leaves

remaining heat
footprints to and from
a sandcastle

in the gutter
a discarded cap collects
swirling leaves

hearth fire burns low
a wind-blown twig
scrapes the window

in the night
the seller of roses returns
ascending and creaking

furnace man
his soft grumble as
he tunes the boiler

the cool air inside
the terminal rests on me
when i say farewell

reed cutting
the stream together again
after a rock

blue smoke travels
down the red rock canyon
echo of a train

autumn rain
a leaf has curled
into its shadow

cold autumn rain
the red eat sign's
soft neon hum

october night
chatter of frogs
in the school pond

gray autumn sky
the blackbirds
turn and turn

half eaten garlic bagel
i know that lipstick

after the bang
on the lake surface
falls dead silence

near the cannery
a whole apple orchard
in one rail wagon

face into the wind
dodging a spider's loose thread
and its pine needle

end of summer
pelicans fly lower
over a wave

summer afternoon
the first drops of rain
on my bare feet

in silence
we toss out bread crumbs
for the ducks

from across the
crowded dining table
her laughter

moonlight in vermont
haiku in the sycamores
moonlight in vermont

yellow leaves
i search for
a tennis ball

shop window
wide-screen tvs
show war scenes

as i undress
the knotty pine
all eyes

backyard sun shower
the windchime song changes
with each cloud

misty eve
a neighbor's dog
gives a long howl

labor day weekend
the faded hulahoop
in the weeds

my old school
the water fountain
much too low

maybe a dozen
so i eat them slowly
black raspberries

tightrope walker
even her smile
balanced

lake by the hotel
canada geese
spend the night

white cat
in a window
almost a statue

after the rain
tall grass drowning
in puddles

sudden rainshowers
the street vendor changes the sign
red roses on sale

summer fun
folds up in a truck
ferris wheel

late summer
descending into her jeans
a celtic tattoo

outside the hospital
the nurses take a drag
moon almost full

life model
performs
stillness

the crane
highsteps carefully
a shaded marsh

shaft of moonlight
the silence between us
atop the lifeguard's chair

long summer day
two little girls looking up
through the leaves

rain at last
the white egret dances
through the shallows

crash
the bicycle wheel
still spinning

my grandfather's portrait
recognizing that look
in my daughter

sunday afternoon
i help my neighbor
take her top down

hailstones click
on the window
tv snow

boulder
the rock art
of lichens

clouded night
faint stars surface
in the bow wave

howling wind
the red kite sprawled
on the sandy shore

cicada song
the bandshell
empty

the still pond
a frog jumps
in gulp

three sparrows bend
the top of the young pear tree
looming sunflower

water colors
the artist dips her brush
into a stream

desert wind
the potter's fingerprints
impressed on an ancient urn

barnes and noble
in all the round letters
bird nests

alone
the cell phone
on her bed rings

over the rise
most likely more
goldenrod

the moon flutters
in the evening breeze
there in the water

hawk on an updraft
showing me how
to relax

dog day afternoon
a grasshopper jumps in front
of the lawn mower

glimpse of a deer
i reach for my camera
too late

shop window
my face reflected
on the mannequin

summer morning
a mallard keeps just abeam
of the fisherman's boat

red pennant
snapping in the breeze
lifeguard's whistle

at dusk
moths gather
to the painting

street sweeper
showering the pavement
fragrance of summer rain

a butterfly pair
follows the young couple
along the boardwalk

the world disappears
except for the sunlight
through lace curtains

pine trees
like jagged teeth
eat willow lake

splinters of sound
the carpenter's hammer
crafts a bookcase

asphalt and roses
on the still air
june heat

waves upon the shore
children playing at the beach
waves upon the shore

sunrise in the river
i let the fish
bite my toes

leaf mites
and a grasshopper
step on each other

smoke from the fire
mingles with the stars
hugging my knees closer

astronomy book
the sea of tranquillity
heavy in my hands

towering pines
a bobcat prowls
in the early mist

blue sky
i almost miss
the morning glory

through the pinwheel
her reflection
in the mirror

rooftop sunlight
temporarily blinds
the sparrow

in the well
studying her image
a woman

warm afternoon
the pear tree's shade
in the neighbor's yard

a driving wind
the stop signs
all flattened

steady downpour
cormorants on the snag
just the same

a cactus bloom's
yellow translucence
blacktop highway

morning stroll
a blade of grass
clings to his shoes

yellow ribbon
tumbling down the street
in the gritty wind

disused rail bridge
the bungy jumper's
taut cable

white gusts
of faded apple blossom
still no rain

an old house
near the cemetery
wild flowers

gray drizzle
a yellow rose
bobbing petals down

chasing the waves
spring moon soft
beneath my heels

swollen river
a boulder's hollow thud
all night long

mother's day
he swims out to where
he left her ashes

this spring night
suddenly my desires
are very simple

breakfast together
the silence about
things that matter

sunlight
between pier planks
sunfish

winter night
i keep the telemarketer
talking

war on the way
i pull enormous weeds
from my tiny garden

at day's end
even the pebbles
cast long shadows

playground after the rain
the sound of traffic

gazing up in the parking lot
i mistook the streetlight
for the moon

crab apple buds
quiver in still air
the first jay

april morning stars
barn swallows chattering
at driveway's end

along the roadside
obscured by tumbleweeds
a stand of white crosses

awaiting friends
returning geese

in the wet snow
even the squirrel's tail
is bedraggled

freak april blizzard
lawn-care sign forlorn
on a plain of icy white

under a spring moon
my neighbors air their
dirty laundry

squirrels nest
at the top of the white birch
penthouse apartment

no blossoms this spring
old cherry tree stark and bare
where she used to play

after spring downpour
the swollen mountain spring
flows in my yard too

noon rush
trying not to notice
the waitress mole

spring storm
her hair is full
of white petals

after the downpour
heavy clouds and fluffed pigeons
share the pavement pool

the early dark
the leaves turn lighter
and lighter

sunlight
a sparrow crosses the river
to brooklyn

construction site
sizing up a new high-rise
the pigeons

spring morning
sun and fresh paint
on the windowsill

broken string
the dragon kite swims
into the wave

a curled ant
on microfiche
tiny words

holding hands
our blue shadows
touch

scarlet and sodden
beneath melting spring snow
her christmas mitten

haiku spring
white blossoms on an
old black bough

lengthening shadows
the fisherman casts
his reflection

haiku world
plum blossoms
trailing ellipses

after a march storm
walking the tide line
a murder of crows

pot of shamrocks
growing on the windowsill
brogue in the wind

walk along the bank
i'll never ever keep pace
with the river

old photo
my father as a child
looks past me

rush hour traffic
from the pick up bed
a recliner faces me

rusted red wagon
a puddle of leaves
on the trampoline

still pond
the gentle curve
of the swan's neck

sudden wind
blowing in from somewhere
yesterday's news

saying good-bye
my hand warms
the iron gate

the whoosh of steam
rom the espresso machine
frosty evening

wintry creek
a pair of mallards
paddle close together

sore throat this morning
the crocus just manages
to swallow a snowflake

a motionless horse
at peace in the field in the
quietly falling snow

new snow
my footprints fill
with shadows

old bedframe
in the yard flower heads
rising up

dim sum
on the hand painted teapot
cherry blossoms

the whine of chainsaws
in morning's early light
ice storm in the south

morning news
with the paper i bring
in a cherry petal

approaching storm
his daughter hasn't told him
about the car dent

counting and recounting
his pennies outside
the butcher's

all night rain
the gaping roof
her shelter

new year's
even the buddha wears a
bright red hood for luck

fresh from the bath
my hand curves
to greet her

sunset
the beach fence darkens
near the moon

squirrel
an exclamation point
on the white page of snow

four languages
around the chess board
suddenly i feel hopeful

icy river
for a short time
caught in silence

winter surf
a dog smells distant places
on other dogs

towering clouds
childhood memories
of dragons

side street
after the train departs
silence

night terminus
on the platform
unbroken snow

overpass
on every streetlight
twenty pigeons

the red balloon
begins to sink
last call

piebald dawn
naked branch tips quiver
in rising wind

in the cold
mirror lined face above
an old sweater

early snow
in my front yard
one more color

midwinter blooms
on all the white lilacs
fresh snow

winter morning
old farmer sowing
the icy walk

spinning
the big dipper
with a finger

even worse
than the baby's screams
its silence

morning commute
colder weather
same station

snowy garden
the fat buddha looks
smaller today

back country roads
the hush of tires
against snow

only ice
in the plastic birdbath
scattered feathers

bus driver
while passengers sleep
he admires the view

noiseless flakes
rear wheels slide
along a different course

eating snow crystals
from a rhododendron leaf
the tufted titmouse

new year
a thin layer of rainwater
coats the window

puff of exhaust
hangs in the empty
intersection

a curious chill
facing the new year's corner
unavoidable

new year's day
noticing the polka dots
on her red dress

new year's eve
the party's noisemakers
in the rest room

winter solstice
in the antique store
a toy from my childhood

in december dusk
a solitary pine tree
all lit up

enveloping
all of the moon at night
white chrysanthemums

thickening clouds
in a snow covered field
the elk crowd together

bag lady
tied to her hat
a christmas bell

temple bell
ringing one thousand times
winter rain

the old man woken
from sleep remembers he has
ten great grand kids

rereading my poems
outside the post office
mostly cloudy

december gusts
two squirrels making squirrels
on the woodshed

winter
the shadows of a crow
on a tree

ancient cemetery
in a leafless tree
a few persimmons

december night
the rise and fall
of chanting voices

wild flock of parrots
sudden multitude of green
on winter branches

early december
the downward drift
of northern gulls

therapy session
i watch the crow fly across
the city limits

she flies high alone
far below the rainforest
philippine eagle

underground tunnel
the brilliance of the
sidewall lights

slowing behind three
girls the sidewalk
three girls wide

neighbor's dog howling
the moon gold yellow and huge
sitting on my lawn

after the argument
quiet when i walk
in the room

wet bodies
of bathing women
full moon night

urban highway
a young man walking
the divider

raven cries
at the top of the old tree
first yellow leaf

soft footsteps
of students bunking
class test

clipping toenails
each one chooses
a new direction

hissing radiator
cat steps on piano

this whole windowsill
full of small green tomatoes
jay sky

quiet evening reading
the baby breathing
on the monitor

autumn chill
last of the snow curled up
in a maple leaf

night surrounding me
wind howling through leafless trees
i quicken my steps

naval station
the clanging of rope
on the pole

october night winds
shuffle through the underbrush
scaring up shadows

neglected birdbath
overflowing with
autumn leaves

tiny mushrooms
and bedewed spider webs
reeking first leaves

angry neighbors
i must find the stray dog
another home

flapping of wings
on the boat canvas
guano

on a sleepless night
counting chirps of a cricket
train whistle sounds out

torn blue recycle bag
the ants trail in and out

after the ebb
little fingers spelling
out his name

the rotten apple
lies on a dried
field flower

gloomy autumn day
her full red lips
a beacon

brooklyn navy yard
the sounds from a playground
across the river

cocktail party
the businessman's name tag
upside down

gray october day
the maple leaves
that much brighter

inside my kitchen
a hummingbird tasting
red chili lights

a load of wood
on her frail back
autumn evening

first cold day
steam rises from
the bread pudding

throwing scraps
at the compost heap
squash vine stands guard

lulled by crickets
the silence
when they stop

late for work
queens ann's lace
crowds the freeway

before sunrise
swaying in a light breeze
a spider’s web

rain letting up
slow trickle of children
back to the street

honeymoon over
in their suitcases
traces of confetti

fallen leaves
scratch at the window
the shade quivers

quiet autumn day
only passing traffic
make the leaves whirl

get rich quick
hot young girls want you
morning email

chill morning
breathing in the last jasmine
exhaling mist

morning haze
atop a midtown building
a crane at work

sharp voices
from behind the curtain
autumn night

summer's end
at the high-water mark
pilot whales

up the cherry tree
her wheelchair's shadow
climbs slowly

stuck in a crack
of the old house's roof beam
engraved wedding ring

a path in the shade
the moon above the meadow
riding on a cloud

waves wash in
waves wash out again
late summer

last light rays
the old cowboy lopes along
across the tv screen

rain
each drop falling exactly
on its own spot

summer drought
the zen garden
in bloom

a bench in the park
wind browsing the newspapers
of a sleeping man

a dragonfly lifts off
the crumpled weeds
its shadow

long before daybreak
the local rooster
starts warming up

lingering heat
taste of hibiscus tea
on your lips

writing a haiku
in the sand a wave
finishes it

old house for sale
in the sidewalk cement
mother’s handprint

cool evening
a fish nudges a pebble
in the aquarium

flying a kite
the girl with a red bow
on her hair

the sunburned garden
grass bends towards
the ground

looking closer
another flower blooms
within the rose

in full bloom
the forgotten onion

party in the new house
a wasp looks for a place
to build its nest

wasp
reflected gold
in morning sunlight

koi pond
cat eyes note
each swirl

twilight
pink bougainvillea over
both sides of a wall

windy day
the outdoor furniture
rearranged

the long walk
her hand
finds mine

the wind swings
the branch of dog rose
and a blackbird's song

a fan blows
in the street's scent
summer rain

summer wind
dry grasses flowing
one hill into another

flapping of wings
in the chestnut tree
a feather

reflected
in the toaster's shine
two ripe tomatoes

50's photo
her atomic breasts
point to the future

deep in the woods
all the shadows bend
toward home

stone skipping
this time
three times

up from behind
the seven eleven sign
august moon

pinned to the desk
by a calculator
the monthly bills

first night of summer
neither the mockingbird nor i
can sleep

last stars fading
today's morning glories
unfurl unnoticed

pale puddles
sound of an air wrench
from the open garage

the old citadel
ramparts overwhelmed
by dandelions

row next door
we break off our argument
to listen

bruised sky over hills
smell of dust on a cool gust
splatter of first drops

the water lily
in the sun and stagnant water
dragonfly in flight

in midst of stillness
the summer's breezes decide
to wake the wind chimes

second story bird song
the doves have returned to their nest
beneath the roof tile

summer evening
just before the
storm breaks

monsoon dawn
shadow of cloud on mountain
hermit lost in meditation

in the mud pond
fragments of hearts everywhere
the lotus leaves

summer moon
strumming love songs
on an old guitar

country churchyard
the shimmer of spiderweb
between the gate posts

the curve of her nails
as she hands me
milk bread matches

surprise summer rain
rhododendron lifts its leaves
dog takes a nap

hot afternoon
cat's eyes flash
with the sun glow

soil ready for tilling
a distant red barn
edges the landscape

an attic window sill
a wasp curls into
its own dust

clear moonlight drawing
a ring around the pond
deep silence

hidden birds
from east to west
thunder is rolling

a longtailed jaeger
two brown eggs nested
atop the hummock

blue heron
standing at attention
in the shadows

a moth
struggling for life
on wire

traffic jam
a driver fingers the breeze
through the sunroof

short summer night
a dewdrop on the back
of a hairy caterpillar

watering
ants with white eggs
climb higher

manicured lawn
two old ladies
in slippers

outdoor bench
tree's shadow
sits lightly

raised voices
a summer moon
in the estuary

lovemaking
after midnight sirens
in the distance

this nightingale
with its voice touches
the moon's sickle

carried by the wind
a gnat has flown into
a swallow's bill

a crow picks at cow's back
in the afternoon
drooping rag-picker

sunday
a high perched squirrel
preaches against trespassing

the same orbit
butterflies during the day
and bats at night

the fly flies
in all directions
evening light

in the weeds
one hundred and one
striped caterpillars

mosquitoes leave me
i have no more blood to take
you’ve drained it all

oh don't swat
the fly rubs hands
rubs feet

summer afternoon
a sea breeze finds its way
through the heat

summer birds
the rise of our baby's chest
against mine

sunshine in the place
where he warmed himself
the old cat

spring departs
birds cry fishes' eyes
are filled with tears

old cemetery
the blank headstones
of unknown soldiers

another spring
beyond the razor wire
cherry blossom

mountain crest
etched against a sky
so blue so blue

water strider
on a trembling moon
distant voices

evening breeze
water laps the legs
of the blue heron

seabird hunts over
hammered silver waves splash
another dent

journey of a millipede
whiteness of the wall
around it

tower
the spread of hawk's wings
in the sun

jacaranda blooms
carpeting may city streets
purple confetti

the shock of color
flowers in the parking lot
as tall as children

cardinal displays
his new red feathers
cloudy sky

a store alarm
ringing and ringing
may rain

jacaranda blooms
a lavender canopy
over the asphalt

may morning
tang of wet spruce
forest riding the wind

still awake
at two o'clock am
spring warblers

these old lilacs
adding thir aroma
to the discussion

on the silvery water
beneath the swan
a swan

wedding gown billows
flowering crabapple tree
throws pink confetti

sudden downpour
bee takes shelter
in a blossom

night driving
through branches of barren woods
twinkling of the stars

south of the river
all of these pear trees
in bloom

row of cherry trees
each one letting go
of a few blossoms

pink and white
clouds crowd the horizon
orchards in bloom

march winds
a butterfly and i
struggle on

methane breeze
rising from the dump
wild blue bells

after the party
empty chairs in the lawn
new moon and i

one am
a neighbor's basement window
the only light

at the yard
an unexpected visitor
hydrangea in bloom

a cold breeze
i ignore the new weeds
for another day

rainy playground
a patch of new grass
hides the softball

holding our daughter
up to her first plum blossoms
petals in her hand

cracked blacktop
maple seedling
sprouting

april wind
the swagger of
the last daffodil

monday morning
the city's secrets
hidden in fog

gray rain
in the park custodian's truck
trays of pink geraniums

these spring mornings
even on cloudy days
the birds are singing

starlight
blinks ephemeral
distant suns

muddy ground
i let the grass grow
one more day

what luck
the southern valley
makes snow fragrant

in the pink
a sparrow flies
out of an azalea

spring in the square
a child's orange tricycle
scattering pigeons

quiet morning fog
chickadee calls
for a mate

a year later
in mother's bare garden
new grass

spring fog
weathered snow fence
sagging in a field

leaning against a
lamppost a young girl
wrapped in a blanket

rain on the window pane
the evergreens drip

the stubble field
where the snow is gone
dark puddles

rowing through
out of the mist
the wide sea

march thaw
on a sofa left for trash
sits melting snow

wild geese
in a hollow gray sky
no letter again

her damp hair
turns golden by the fire
winter rain

fading evening light
small glow of a lamp
up in the mountain

birdbath
a sparrow pecks
at the frozen sun

an automobile idling
in the parking lot
takeout trash

through bare branches
a withering wind howls
empty railway platform

quiet sunday morning
winter's daylight growing
behind the curtains

snow storm
the spray covering
the jetty

fading evening light
thud of a basketball
on the board

rain for days
daytime so gray
the dark stippled with light

cold sheets
beyond the darkness
a train whistle

year of the horse
her head tossing the ripples
of her perm

a spider's thread
between the eave and door
morning sunlight

bareroot rose bundles
on sale at the discount store
already sprouting

insomnia
the traffic signal
changes for nobody

six am
sun plays peekaboo
at baby's window

for company
the distant cry
of a crow

february tides
a trawling boat stranded
on the mudflats

iron frozen pond
random stone's ricochet
ring the settling silence

dusk
the light goes out
with the tide

waiting for the train
alone on the platform
swatting mosquitoes

the silence
of a winter morning
snowflakes

spring water burble
in stone cold sky
five hundred sandhill cranes coming

lost top
of the tall birch
in a heavy fog

winter morning
at the empty bird feeder
a cardinal

cold air
and half-open door
cat on the threshold

edge of prairie
the crow perched
on a wagon wheel

glancing again
at the maple buds
the falling snow

camping morning
sun over my shoulder
as i shave

shoveling snow
and singing a don ho song
under my breath

winter morning
a finger writes
on a frosted window

cracked door spilling light
shines brightly into stalled space
remembering still

wind in the field
measuring their shapes
the dusty gourds

winter sun
a blanket covers
the bearded iris

tree farm
only the small pines
still standing

bristling
and prickly with cold
the hairs on the arm

dead on the
christmas tree
a dragonfly

evening commute
a dozen crows
on the horizon

lakeside diner
a tipped over picnic table
encased in ice

long night over
the same morning stars
in the locust tree

winter sun
caught by the branches
of the chestnut tree

chilly morning
of the new millennium
there's no snow-fall yet

anticipated like breeze
for which you are braced
the new years surprise

new year's eve
black ice and woodsmoke
near the bus stop

winter solstice
the whirl of dead leaves
behind us

the large turkey
carved with neat precision
retired coroner

seafoam rubs the shore
meeting white banks of new snow
sandpipers depart

before first frost
visiting the garden
more slowly

late in evening
receiving email reading them
and dreaming

early snow
falling through branches
sticks to the buck's antlers

dusting of snow
a sparrow's footprints
every which way

fine chill gray rain
on shoppers rushing past
inside we are warm

so cold
excited dog drags me reluctantly
out for a walk

in the wheelbarrow
patches of rust
filled with frost

fifty buzzards
off the water tower
winter trees

winter sun
a goanna stretched out
on a fallen tree

after the rain
a falling yellow leaf
lit by the sun

winter sunrise
only pale green moss
on the cottonwoods

faint autumn moon
a sheet of newspaper
crumpled by the wind

sidewalk puddle
sunk to the bottom
a red leaf

chill morning
breathing in the last jasmine
exhaling mist

the slow blink
of radio tower lights
autumn chill

last rose
of faded summer
same fragrance

late sunrise
a walnut rolls
down a roof

through the window
the smell of the first snowflakes
came into the room

a blustering day
lying in the wet street
a bag lady

climbing through
fire escape stairs
ivy's red leaves

fall sunrise
the shadows of leaves
follow the wind

heavy rain
the road full of potholes
smooth again

midnight
a cat laps the moon
in a water bowl

first frost
the radiator taps in time
with my pen

a withering wind
seated in the falling dusk
a street minstrel

morning fog
the scent of
eucalyptus

white cloud
on the wet sand
the seagulls

harbour walk
in the oily pool
a rainbow

full moon at midnight
light and heat enough for moths
lunatic lovers

bird flew away
hunting dog is howling
in a frozen river

slowly coming down
the spiral of leaves
the evening light

a bald man ahead of me
i wonder about each scar

shadowy grove
outside the locked ward
a moonless night

north wind
steam from the dryer vent
follows it

smoke scented air
a squirrel burrows
in the wood pile

autumn leaves
floating through the reflection
of autumn leaves

after the shower
the reflection of the sky
in an empty shell

pine barrens
a blackbird chasing
its shadow

summer's end
a policeman napping
on a shady bench

evening on the terrace
parakeets over green treetops
a shade different

withering cattails
pond's epitaph cracked clay curls
crayfish dig deeper

raven flaps off
the plastic birdbath
spilling over

autumn wind
the slow drift of
dandelion seeds

mid october
mustard flowers dot
the stubbled field

black clouds
water falling
through rocks

it's finally dawn
filling with light the drapes
billow and stretch

four or five men dance
in a circle above them
the moon is about to drop

library patron
with a sour smile holding
divorce for dummies

old man at the gate
surveys the busy street scene
three days now no dog

the dark yard
a few grass blades
hold the moonlight

the lochness
a patch of sunlight
deepens it

neighbor's funeral
dandelions ripple
vacant plots

two hawks circle
rising up with the air currents
above placid waters

a long day
tagnant shadows nailed
to my kitchen floor

haloed moon
in the dark field water spills
from a silver pipe

a snipe perches
on the no parking sign
lingering heat

in a city lane
caught in puddle
the moon

a flash of white
the hawk flies low
across the field

downpour ending
the narrow stems of fallen leaves
point to the sky

garden candles glow
clinking glasses and laughter
september twilight

under a gray sky
flocks of geese passing
no shadows at all

gray september sky
bees cling to summer's remains
some windblown asters

the moonlit river
its silver surface broken
by a salmon's splash

if nothing else
there are these clouds
floating away

cage of a leopard
not a water drop
remains in the sky

across the rooftop
sounds of a baby crying
come in on the wind

dark mist
a raccoon silently slips
into the dumpster

unable to sleep
a neighbor's wife looking
into the street

empty bait cups
scattered along the shore
end of summer

lightning bugs
reflect a mason jar of silence
gold dust in my hand

white moon onyx sky
no clouds hiding the fierce stars
tranquil summer night

summer twilight
shadows linger on
the empty porch swing

spray from
a sea wall
rainbow

night fishing
the small boy hooks
a plastic bag

an inchworm
humps and straightens
purple dusk

warm summer morning
feathers and fluff on the screen
lie still as the heat

two sleeping kids
before the grunion
run a family leaves

sharp asphalt fumes
rise in shimmering waves
summer parking lot

the mint bush
transplanted once too often
droops

near the water
in the gravel
one dandelion

a gun in the wildflowers
one young man
more or less

half a moon
pasted on the blue
morning sky

ladybug crosses
my eye's reflection
on the window

dragonfly ascends
moon silent beneath the drum
of wings screaming past

paper prayer
the resting legs of a fly
on its proboscis

sudden gust
the rasp of reeds
circles the pond

morning drizzle
a stray cat cautiously
searches for shelter

summer sun
the honking of snow geese
on the tundra

dew climbed
on the closed petals
of field chamomiles

little brown sparrow
singing goodbye to the sun
in the soft twilight

turning
our backs to the fire
silent night

a few green buds
the turtle pokes his head
through the sky

ladybugs
in a mesh bag
storm coming

rattle of the fan
on the windowsill
a waxing moon

open window
the cat dozes half in
half out

glint of sunlight
on a wooden power pole
the numbered metal tag

fresh washed hair
everywhere i go
making trickles

bluebird nest box
a flash of sky
in darkness

traceless
the water strider's path
sky above sky below

frog after frog
echoes across the pond
rings of moonlight

cottonwood seed
first one then another
then a blizzard

dark swirl of starlings
drunken thumbprint on the sky
many roll as one

bumping on water
lazy wooden boats afloat
awaiting daylight

dawn
the river unraveled
with sunlight

swimming hole
in the dragonfly's embrace
a dragonfly

the stillness
soaking into stones
a cicada's cry

a boy swims alone
in sea reaching to the sun
look his head gleaming

moonlit camellias cafe
conversation spilling
into the street

waiting at the curb
mirrored on the skyscraper
a brick chimney

pond fishing
on my ankle
the only bite

the lilypond moon
cut to shreds by a pebble
the garden darkens

the song of bees
turning weeds
to honey

treetops
obscured by fog
children at play

spring morning vision
by the little waterfall
cosmos in water

scenic overlook
a single fire hydrant
in the pet area

a bright breeze
dandelions just higher
than the grass

feeding the koi
the soft ripples
spread the sunset

wire fence
he smell of coal dust
from the barge

the honeydew
watching tv i finish
the other half

late spring
the fading glow of the comet
in the evening sky

spring afternoon
the sound of gears and sails
from the windmill

wind debates with wind
shingles fly away in haste
the argument ends

shingle beach
pebbles made smoother
by every wave

afloat in the sky
a thousand brown plane tree leaves
crocus in flower

a bend in the road
red ribbons and full moon
kite festival

inch by inch
the full moon escapes
from the spiderweb

changing sky
two crows perched
on a streetlight

coney island light
a kewpie doll in the sand
just before sunrise

printed cotton shift
a laughing hillbilly gal
pretty as morning

in the looming dusk
a heron spears a bluefish
the pond just ripples

even in the city
a hawk soars out of
the morning sky

ferris wheel
it rolls to the edge
of the night

summer holidays
the call of a butcher
bird and the surf

losing its grip
the red ladybug
on the blue wall

daisy
its flower opens
to the sun

silent neighborhood
thickened morning fog
hushes the yard dogs

petals of chrysanthemum
curve in their whiteness
under the moon

a mud hen
gliding into the reeds
tall trumpet lilies

withering lilacs
and the scent of somebody's
old clothes

spring rain
beneath the umbrella
quickening footsteps

always spring
in the old woman's garden
plastic daffodils

lantana bushes
this side of the chainlink
they grow wild

showers raining down
urgent hands roam down valleys
rivers awaiting

wind in the long grass
every green thing
breathing

the morning star
through the caravan skylight
a peacock's scream

late april hail
a quick game of pachinko
in magnolias

the pear blossoming
after the battle
this ruined house

mouth of the river
idle waves foam on gray sand
rippled by the wind

they call this flower
white peony yes
but a little red

dawn beach
a feral cat creeping across
the parking lot

through the chainlink
neighbors debating
the chance of rain

blue iris
the egret's beak ripples
the reflection

heavy wet snow
calls of geese lost
in the spring storm

broken clouds
reveal a full moon silver
cactus thorns

lighthouse
in the sea breeze
faint stars

outside my window
hundreds of views exist between
spaces of tree branches

the black reservoir
a string of taillights circling
around the pale moon

the park bench
covered in snow
quietly waiting

cold white flakes settle
soft white wool
i see no sheep

sun shower
the oily pavement
stained with rainbows

a bunch of poppies
bursting through concrete outside
the door of my house

daybreak
the flowerbed full
of new mushrooms

smoke whirls
after the passage of a train
young foliage

leaky roof
a wet friend
offers a loan

after the rain
eucalyptus bark
glistening

ferry steamer
a token in the mouth
of the river

cloud break
the smooth shadow
of a cactus

sea breeze
footprints becoming
beach again

alongside the river
the budding cottonwoods
so full of blue sky

cherry blossoms
working in the paddy
we see all their stamens

homeless shelter
a bowl of cat food
outside the door

the fog rises up
ghostlike from the lake surface
winter surrenders

sun pushes through mist
tai chi dancers move as one
morning in shanghai

cherry petal shells
even the sand crabs live
in that light

the landscape is halved
fog slumps across the valley
carrying the night

at the cliff face
my wandering ends
the raven's begins

spring snow
like waves climbs
over the fence

chill wind
beneath the monk's robe
a naked monk

lying on the couch
sunlight shines in one window
and out the other

cool breeze
squirrels examine
rain debris

snow stopped
in the voices of children
the sun shines

between two heartbeats
the iv tubing lets fall
one more tiny drop

library silence
a spider skitters cautiously
through virginia woolf

winter dusk
the magician produces
a dove

winter cold
gliding up and down on
offshore breezes

icicle dripping
from the eave
to the sill

rose light
on your upturned face
this morning

rusty roof
creaking under the hot midday sun
summer storms brewing

is that a dewdrop
or the evening star nestled
in the northern pine

with fearsome roar
last autumn's fallen leaves
are blown away

artic wind
along the blue ice
snow eddies

oncology
reception room flowers
still plastic

creeping through predawn night
paper delivery

well let's go snow viewing
till we tumble

winter afternoon
the tiny grandmother
sits in silence

the old red barnn stands
all doors and windows missing
the rain falls inside

january rain
a solitary calla
among the old leaves

almost lost
in the shimmer of water
several ducklings

stuffy museum
doors to the beetle hall
opening and closing

cold air
tickles around my ear
fresh haircut

watching a squirrel
empty magnolia seed pods
slide down the roof

almost a harvest moon
this disk over the bloody mountains'
late winter white

wind carved glaciers
swell and crest across greenland
crash on granite blocks

winter sunset
backlights the alders
a small bird moves on

winter noon
red buildings brighten
the sidewalk

so cold
two dogs and the cat
together at the fire

no hushed leaf applause
just wind through the branches
of the naked elms

casino
its light fades away
in the dawn

sudden breeze
water lilies hold
the pond still

already freezing
across the lake one goose
honks once

the wood smoke
rises unnoticed
winter light

january morning
yellow leaves still falling
on the frosty grass

first skiff of snow
a tidings of magpies
confer on hard ground

muddy lot
of the psychiatrist
winter drizzle

new year's day
empty wine glasses
catch morning sunlight

dog's got the door mat
tussles drags fights it through
the fallen leaves

airport bars are hell
a line of thunderstorms
make mine a double

midday sunset
azure to jade orange rose
over blue snow

waves of light
up and down the tree
fireflies

paper tablecloths
poinsettias make an arrow
and point to the punch

puddles
at a train crossing
moons shiver

lucy barks sleeping
runs dreaming beside our horse
surf sprays us all

first snow
on the great wall
tourist tracks

bright green moss
blooming on the shed's gray threshold
new paint for old wood

chipmunks busily rustling
in new fallen leaves
the harvest won't wait

a steam plume rises
against slate gray fog bank
south san francisco

a single cricket
sounding a single sharp cry
as the moon appears

flaming hills
of golden grass dawn
on interstate five

my tiny garden
through warped fence palings
the morning sun

gray green water
sunlight on weathered pilings
a seagull cries out

old man
in vegie patch
almost a scarecrow

three gnarled pines
shade the street corner lot
where laborers wait

writing on water
the egret looking for fish
makes little footnotes

crayon map
my son shows me the way
to neverland

part street light
part moon light 
first kiss

the taste of smoke
in the single malt
autumn deepens

narrow road
the clash of umbrellas
as we near the buddha

the world a blossom
i make up a song
for my dog

morning mist
a parrot asks
my plan today

the puddle
deeper than i thought
empty mailbox

the wren’s empty nest
just a little less
of the moon

blue whale
the outstretched arms
of a toddler

first day of spring
a puppy at the pet shop
wags itself

spring!
a bug i don’t know
looks me straight in the eye

still some snow
on the upturned canoe
seed hulls

colorless wind
the ashes
that don’t scatter

winter solitude
another long night
where things left off

awkward silence
a guest pinches
a sprig of lavender

spring dusk
a turtle laying eggs
in railbed cinder

looseknit sweater 
the spring wind comes to me
in a thousand ways

deep winter
i hang my shadow
in the closet

romance ends
pot-shaped clods of dirt
on the compost pile

scent of guava
a glimpse of my youth
in the fruit aisle

the softness
of lamb’s ears
garden for the blind

blizzard from the north 
the buffalo turn
to face the white

school reunion
failing to recognize
the winter goldfinch

always making
something out of nothing
the brilliance of crows

mid-winter
the stillness of the sardines
in the tin

a gazillion germs
in a sneeze
yet more stars

winter gulls
the grit of sand
in soap

the big dipper
my dog keeps searching
for the right spot

swollen moon
the winter diet
of comfort food

office aquarium
the fish and i
in different boxes

a pawn sacrificed
keeping the game alive
this freezing night

a first kiss
on the edge of summer
sand in my shoe

family picnic 
my son runs a finger
over his birthmark

approaching storm
a fluorescent swimsuit
on the clothesline

high desert
the weathered rock
gives up a shell

scent of her hair
wave after wave
touches the shore

bullfrogs croak
in the river
women harvest stones

migraine 
the red fan opening
fold by fold

with a little rain
the color returns
to a stone

carving emoticons
in ice cream
lonely town

octopus
i already know
the way home

ears over eyes
the pigs stretch out
in the evening sun

village fair
insects fly round and round
a tube light

her heart
on her sleeve
firefly

keep off grass
the tut tut tut
of a sprinkler head

wind waves
through the tall wheat
missing her

cockatoo roost
the last light of evening
folded in the hills

starry night
a black rhino
fills the water hole

bare feet
the child squelches
through a cowpat

summer squall
lily pads
hold the pond in place

wild mustard scent
a bed
shared with sisters

aroma of coffee
in the morning breeze
my new lover

catch and release
a little shine left
on my fingers

shimmering lake
how unimportant
what’s important

cloud castles
the music we heard
just air

alone in the bush
just me
and a blowfly

skinny dipping
mayflies
shed their skins

illuminating
motel wallpaper
headlamps

rain from the west
sifts through the porch screen 
the evening cool

dining alone
the festival lights
keep a regular beat

in our face
the dog shakes off
the ocean

winter solitude
the elevator speaks
to me

blowing snow
i learn the secrets
of the wind

winter sun
the soft flicker of waxwings
in the firethorn

taking a left
when i should have gone right
spring drizzle

spring moon
her tippy-toes bring her
that much closer

a red fox
appears disappears
winter wind

all day writing poems
the sound of paper settling
in the bin

a flutter
in the doe’s flank
crocus in snow

good friday
walking to confession
in worn shoes

moon-washed garden
wondering what became
of the tailless thrush

scent
of raked leaves 
an old wound

autumn sun
the man on a bicycle
hugs his pumpkin

autumn twilight
i tell the hostel
we’re almost there

black fingers
in the dough
a hint of winter

a faint chance of snow
the right money moves
for the year ahead

autumn woods
my son and i
not just dna

halloween
the white cat’s
black shadow

the sky
gray with voices
late geese

shorter days
my medicare card
arrives in the mail

emptying the trap
a pumpkin seed between
the mouse’s teeth

stuck
in the eddy
autumn sky

persimmon sky
two blackbirds puff up
their silhouettes

two attempts
at the trouser leg
new year’s day

snow squeak
the longest branch bounces
with sparrows

slideshow
our winter vacation
the white wall

last autumn colors 
the cloister fountain
keeps singing

antler clash
the moose
lock breaths

the soft blur
of sleeping swans
winter light

first star
my son says he knows
the speed of light

deep winter
i lose my list
of things to do

skylight raindrop
holding jupiter
and the moon

lovemaking 
over his shoulder
the moon

the cricket’s song
what’s left
of the moon

autumn zephyr
my daughter imitates
a maple seed

autumn woods
my last walk as a bachelor
memorizing vows

wind-blown sky
a dragonfly’s grip
on the clothes line

autumn orchard
the oval of a basket
imprinted on the grass

morning cicadas
a vine reaches
into open space

horseshoe pit
a yellow maple leaf
leans on the spike

the vermillion glow
from the pistachio trees 
i knew your father

sudden winter
the press of cold metal
against the paper gown

holidays over
change from someone’s pocket
between couch cushions

no desire
to talk it through
first moon of winter

this way and that
winter sun
in a rabbit’s ear

stark tree limbs
a cyclist i see
every morning

another new year
the reek of gunpowder wafts
on the cold night air

hunger moon
the many shades
of snow

a wren at sunrise
it seems too early
to write of death

stark tree limbs
i have nothing
of my hometown

raging blizzard
the gritted teeth
of jumper cables

sun-filled eddy 
a swainson’s thrush sings
an upward spiral

turning tide
a barnacle waits
on a limpet

first drops
a frog syncopates
with the cicadas

same as it was
when we were cavemen
the moon

dry september
water gurgles
in my fish tank

returning home 
i cross to the cricket’s
side of the road

mossy creek bank
the days when i could be
anything

a butterfly
in her cupped hands
end of summer

misty morning 
lingering smell of cattle
in abilene

cicada song
spanish moss dipped
in sunlight

first snow
the snug fit of spices
in their rack

pensioned 
filling the days
with late tomatoes

summer’s end
the mother of the bride
holds an empty hat box

height of autumn
a blackbird almost
to two octaves

freezing rain
a vendor takes the lid off
his makeshift oven

winter solstice 
steam from the squash
released from its skin

paying the last bill
on the kitchen table
winter solstice

christmas eve
an old cement foundation
all that’s left

thanksgiving 
looking at photographs
of the great depression

the sound of geese
resting on the water
evening snow

bulge of my feet
at the bottom of the quilt
the long night

a light flurry
carol singers
on fast forward

snowed in
fire wraps
around a log

memorial day 
the mockingbird
repeats his song

taking the short way
the toes of her shoes
damp with dew

wind surfing
gulls hover
over the wipeouts

as girls we watched
heat lightning across the bay 
only now the thunder

blinding sunshine 
a stranger with the smile
of an old friend

under the rainbow
a hundred cows with
one expression

distant thunder
my daughters’ laughter
on the carousel

milky way
a stream of termites
from the woodpile

sky of no clouds
sand from the shaman’s hand
conjures a rainbow

fishing
with dad again
the ripples

october light
i open my ribs
to pray

migrating birds
my father sends the next son
on his way

autumn night 
a stranger paints her lips
before the next stop

billowing skirts
by a soldier’s grave
autumn deepens

carillon bells
a wedge of cranes
flying south

amber light
the time it takes
a leaf to fall

autumn deepens 
the corn maze open
to the cows

all saints’ day 
under the sheets
a ghost hides her stash

remembrance day
traffic sounds crisscross
the bagpipes

that grassy knoll
pigeons explode
into flight

reaching
where the hose won’t 
summer rain

slow night
the flycatcher sizzles
over the door

a squeeze of the hand
and we stand among them 
croaking toads

the august hayfield
raked into windrows 
a dipper of water

drawing a heart
the wet sand
between my fingers

sultry evening
the pizza receipt clings
to a beer bottle

moonlit pond
he lifts his child above
the threat of frogs

adobe wall 
a row of pots
fill with light

summer grasses
a golden fuzz
on the blowfly’s belly

fireflies
the dreams i had
as a child

my bare feet
among heron tracks
ebb tide

a smear of stars
from horizon to horizon 
the loon’s necklace

summer house 
the key sticks
when leaving

nameless longings
a floating seed
eludes my hand

vacant playground
the shadow of the swing
wanders off

thin moon
a harrier hawk
working the field

end of summer
the sheep the color
of parched grass

first cool night
i dream of knitting
firefly sweaters

tobacco harvest
women in lamplight
tie the quilt

rural school
the shy smiles of children
waiting for the bus

birth book
a toddler scribbles
in the blank spaces

darkening clouds
i press cold earth
on tulip bulbs

dawn on dal lake
emerging from the mist
the flower boat

spring grass
the rounded rump
of an angus steer

washing trays
that held rice seedlings 
a song from the river

first steps
the scent of earth
clings to her shoes

wood anemone
only the hare
and i

first warm day
we check the mountainside
for wild goats

scent of lilacs
my dog waits for me
to catch up

a fishing fleet
hanging in the clouds
the spring horizon

escalator
out of the subway
snowfall

dark comes early now 
we speak of the children
we didn’t have

winter morning
the stray cat returns
with a wound

lullaby
she reaches
to feel each word

the stump chewed
to a fine point 
winter lodgings

the last commuter
scraping windshield ice
orion’s belt

tenement clotheslines
sinking lower
winter clouds

prayers and hymns
echoing from long ago
sunlight on a pew

long night
the smell of eucalyptus
on a baby’s chest

icy morning
the twists and turns
of a child-proof cap

fall equinox
stacking the hand-me-downs
into equal piles

i skirt around
a stone cutter’s rhythm
autumn sunset

almost evening 
the paper vendor sleeps
on old news

hometown visit 
i fill my pocket
with acorns

playground swings 
a strong wind replaces
the children

field mice
forage the corn bin
harvest moon

bottoms up 
that amber glow
of autumn sun

dark september day
stillborn given a name
for the funeral

no cicadas
no double dutch
park bench peeling

a rusty still
by the dry creek bed 
blood moon rising

frost on the daphne
the way he says
never mind

teenagers
holding up a wall
first dandelion leaf

dawn breeze
leaf shadows
on her freckles

echo
of the pileated’s call
wavering lake reflection

sunbeams
the crow’s slow side-shuffle
down the wire

strawberry picking 
i stumble
over my past

chickadee chatter
all the people peripheral
to a life

morning prayer
a white-throated sparrow
opens with song

marbled weather
gulls in free fall
over the ocean

twice swept out
twice blown back
a dove’s feather

cottonwoods
over a slow stream
the heat

his 44th 
water that doesn’t run back
into the ocean

more war dead 
an uprooted tree
rides the storm tide

gray afternoon
a ladybug escapes
the storm window

vivaldi
olive leaves ripple
silver

summer sky
my father counts the black faces
on my road

venus rising
a coyote trap
snaps shut

in the season
of wandering dragonflies
my urge to roam

storm clouds 
hearing the pauses
in the katydid’s song

night of fireflies 
fishing lights
off the island

raven’s cry
all the partings
still to come

the warm glow
of living rooms 
one of them mine

sleet storm
the bare tree branches glisten
with grackles

sound of the dog
getting through
to the marrow

moving day
the old dog paces
the empty rooms

winter sunset 
an aerial rattles
with magpies

needles of rain
the talk show guest
addresses my problem

mid-morning
an ice-crack ricochets
across the river

rain patter
on the windshield
second lie

winter sunset
on the surf line
jellyfish globes

weathered bridge
everything but the moon
drifting downstream

pink sky
a woman sings
to her laundry

fierce bull
a little bird
on the hump

midsummer’s eve 
even the terrifying mongrel
decorated with flowers

silence after thunder
a damselfly’s
still wings

morning light
each cattle egret
selects its cow

my daughter skips off 
in a drying clam shell
a color i couldn’t name

summer vacation
the bumpy ride
back home

evening thunder
magpies scold something
at the windmill

campgrounds
a snail shell
in our spot

honeymoon 
the undertow pulls the sand
from beneath my foot

map unfolded
an earwig scurries
from main roads

the mother quail
keeps calling her lost chick
summer twilight

first light
my brow breaking
a strand of web

hard paddling
the wind
dries my teeth

sun-warmed patio
the bird with one foot
bellies down

his small please
a burial procession
for the fish

remaining heat
the frayed edge
of a salesman’s tie

summer solstice 
insect eggs swell
in the alder leaves

harsh sun
a child watches fishermen
club eels

summer solstice
the bright spaces between
long tree shadows

a quiet afternoon 
the pinwheel twirls
only halfway

boys play past dusk
the smell of water
from a garden hose

bird call insect
who is it wakes me
in the deepest dark?

morning fog
a carpenter calls
for a two by four

leaves turning 
the toboggan hanging
in the dark garage

ebb tide
the other tracks in the sand
also mine

clothesline 
ballet tights frozen
in fifth position

half-empty bed
i try to recall
his faults

an early chill 
the toolshed door
pounds on its latch

one maple leaf
end over end on the sand
without a trace

gliding hawk
balancing the light
on stiffened wings

quitting time
snowflakes blend
with the crowd

heather in bloom 
between wind gusts
the sound of my pen

country store 
two old-timers whittle
over world affairs

first day of school
the line of children
at the pencil sharpener

autumn sun
the comfort
of old blue jeans

thinning bones 
craters darken
the harvest moon

rain today
a foot tapping
of its own accord

summer’s end
a flatbed’s loose chain
rattles down the road

17 years
how carelessly she flicks off
the cicada

last of the sunlight
cows bounding
downhill

a keeper moon
the old fisherman
lets out more line

black pond
swallowing snowflakes
a goose dips her beak

ice melted 
she reads garcia marquez
under a cat

spring wind
the sprinter dashes
the other way

the evening star
our flower-viewing faces
begin to change

twilit city
creek pebbles
in my shoe

silent spring 
a cooper’s hawk
stalking the bushes

bilingual children
honey bees move
into the bird house

cloudless sky 
in mayan nine words
for the color blue

steel band at twilight 
a single file of ducklings
crosses the bay

night heat 
the rising scent
of mosquito repellant

cloud cover
the vendor places each peach
sunny side up

muted neighs
the country fair scent
of corn dogs

grazing doe
her brief glance
at the freeway

alone on the water
i hang on to what's left
of the light

twilight
lolloping rabbit tails
whiten the quiet

crickets and porch
everything is more
than together

undone
by another
sunset

between breaths
a shooting star
becomes the night

star filled sky
through a crack in the shed
raccoon eyes

the airspace
between raindrops
prayer flags

into the hollows
of a nighthawk's song
evening mist

one-night stand
the newly-formed blossom
of a wild plum

singing in the rain
a robin
with its own version

easter egg hunt
resurrecting
last year's plastic eggs

the swing of her plaits
as she skips to school
spring morning

garbage day
blindsided
by morning honeysuckle

skywriting
in my face
the gnat

creosote
glistening on telephone poles
midday heat

drowsy afternoon
clover heads heavy
with beebuzz

african summer
elephants trumpet
in the dusty plains

cracked flagstone
an ant lugging its caterpillar
home

sea of dry grass
the news that there is
no ithaca

tall grass
so dry it hums
dad's death day

prayer circle
the time it takes dust
to settle

i hoist my son
onto my shoulders
solar eclipse

plum blossoms
to make a long story
short

spring dream
slipping my wings
into a work shirt

holding twilight into dusk   
the ends of maple branches
heavy with buds

with each call
faint ripples
surround the frog

earth day
the pecking order
of chickens

first warm day
grandpa has found
his pet rock

planting lavender
the black velvet g-string
in the bottom of my drawer

lifting mist
the field workers
in red bandanas

migrating finches
the blur
of a pinwheel

short nap
the friction of shadows
in the spring garden

morning after
all the balloons
down from the ceiling

meeting gone astray
i put myself
in airplane mode

deep winter
the important parts
underlined

act ii
i eat the last
of the nuts

polenta
crackles in bacon grease
swirl of light snow

cold rain
a basket of socks
i'll never darn

first warm day
a robin works
the infield

spring equinox
an egret one
with the marsh

early spring
wrapped in morning mist
a leaping trout

just after
the priests' chants
cuckoo song

mango rain
the tea table stretches
the card game

hill farms leaning towards
their last
lilac

dried-up daffodils
wads of writer's block
in the waste basket

new graveyard
a lawnmower man pauses
to choose the path

quarreling crows
the fat bellies
of pasture ponies

poplar silk
wind lifts the mane
of the chestnut stallion

sultry night
the neighbor's cat
begins its caterwaul

vedic chants
children's voices rise above
the scolding squirrel's

tea by the window
steam and our words pass
through the screen

limiting its search
to just this planet
white butterfly

at the edge
of night and day
the dove's call

redwood grove
the light that reaches us
upon waking

still morning
only the creak
of the porch swing

juno beach
the rattle
of sand

school's out
the doors of empty lockers
bang in the wind

graduation
the clouds gather too
patch by patch

summer camp
children sieve the sky
for tadpoles

fading sunset
fruit bats over the midge cloud
over the river

day of discontent
the crows nominate
themselves

the warmth
of mismatched gloves
first snowfall

winter solstice
the forest's empty treetops
filled with stars

satsumas
the way his story
unravels

rustle of silk
embroidered peacocks dance
on her saree

there are times
when we are graced
snowlight

church service
in a different language
lingering smell of incense

long journey
i open the bus's curtain
to a starlit sky

the howling wind
bare branches furred
with ice

a ladder
leans into the loft
winter light

unpicked apples
now and then
a thump in the fog

a walk with father
the stream slowing down
near the mouth

sunday afternoon
the soft sanity
of old blue jeans

sidewalk drawings
our old beagle sniffs
the moon and stars

laundry at night
the empty sleeves
of the wind

black moon
a midnight train
at full throttle

lingering moon
the bleats of one valley
answered by the next

water tower
from a train learning half
the town's name

getting up
on the wrong side
fall equinox

a stranger
in the town where i grew up
freshening wind

church bell
a western gull drops a clam
on the rocks

a drip of resin
stills the green beetle
windswept pine

autumn chill
koi shimmy up
the sunlight

end of dinner
on the balcony
the waif-thin moon

thundercloud
my childhood ogre
changes shape

rising
from an osprey's nest
the moon

battling elk
my elbow
claims the arm rest

iris
a memory
unfurls

whelk shell
the sound
of vacation

somewhere inside
the banyan tree
a cuckoo's call

diving
into the color of water
summer shadow

virga rain
the empty crib
in the next room

staying at the temple
beneath the bonsai tree
a gnat

an afternoon of small talk
sunflowers turn their heads

drainage ditch
the luxury
of skunk cabbage

long summer
the river bared
to the bottom

tasting our way
through the dry reds
autumn rain

sleeper car
the leitmotif
of whistle stops

dusk
light hinged on
the last gate paling

heavy sky
a column of mill smoke
supports the clouds

still not home
north star
an anchor in darkness

graveyard path
frost
in the footprints

remembrance day
a toddler crying
for her fallen flag

this orange
touched by so many hands
i eat with gratitude

home alone
she talks to the baby
in her womb

winter solitude
the cat carefully folds his paws
under his chest

summer stars missing
the dark shape
of the dark lighthouse

morning dew
a circle of fallen petals
beneath the peony

summer morning
the kitten ignores itself
in the full-length mirror

a common wire fence
then a western tanager
sits there a moment

up to their necks
in lawn daisies
the robin   the worm

discussion with friends
motionless fish
in the aquarium

reaching a wide stream
the trail continues
on the other side

pine tops
against deep twilight
a bob-white's call

flowering crabapple
in and out of morning sun
the lark's song

may sun
the door opens
before i knock

breezy afternoon
dandelion ghosts
float past the daisies

scent of pines
a wind from the hill
leads me home

country kitchen
stray strands of cornsilk
glisten in the sun

one rock for my garden
a thousand ants
rescuing eggs

acres of coal cars
honeysuckle climbing
the train yard fence

electrical storm
my daughter practices
the letter s

sirens nearing
a sudden breeze sways
the basket of cactus

sultry day
boys on their wheels
making the wind blow

stones stacked
inside the wheelbarrow
a firefly's glow

midday heat
taking it in
the white gardenia

bouquet of roses
she slips into
something else

gas station
one worn-out hiking boot
beside the trash can

summer heat
an old man's flirtation
turns to a yawn

sea oats
a beachball blows
between dunes

moonlit beach
a sandcrab emerges from
under the castle moat

in sycamore shade
the buzzing summer
a moment still

summer evening
the girl who forgot my name
is laughing again

empty beach house
a seashell left
on the windowsill

every night
this stretch of road
honeysuckle

heads down
the sunflower
the finch

new dock
the snowy egret's stride
unchanged

the gold light
of an autumn day
the autumn sea

pale sun
the frozen river holds
deep shadows

casino
its light fades away
in the dawn

late august
the way the spider's web
bows with each gust

darkened garden
on this night of no moon
the white eggplant

stubbled rice paddy
the white heron's harsh cry
has no echo

a patch of coltsfoot
amid roadside debris
the overcast brightens

dozy afternoon
the bangle-seller's call
the length of an alley

first of summer
the seductive label
of a new wine

little black dress
i squeeze her lipstick
into my cummerbund

happy hour outdoors
the complimentary
sunset

waterfront cafe
incoming tide through planks
beneath our feet

gathering the night
around itself
whippoorwill

stargazing
my fingers
grasping sand

buzzing neon
the way he talks
about new york

withered fields
the pulsing of
a lone glow worm

in the deep hollows
yellow leaves
linger

tarp-covered yacht
the longer shadows
of a fake owl

the sea
with the final say
widow's walk

in the curves
of an alto sax
amazing grace

thinking about how
language is made
the cold crow's carrr

leaf raking
the swish-swish
of corduroy

mars landing
the crunch of dry leaves
to her doorstep

only one small
darth vader
i start on the milky ways

sunlight on water
vowels
in the syllables of birds

scent of wind
a lizard steps out
of its old skin

fish market
the smell of old sails
on his coat

leaving their echoes ringing
woodpeckers debugging
boards in the barn

the splash
our anchor
splitting stars

sea cave
the thoughts i keep
inviting back

incoming tide
the lullabies my mother
learned from her mother

from the ocean
to her moat
a bucket mostly spilled

those evenings
when ripeness is just reaching
the pits of plums

young osprey
how to land softly
with a trout

girdled maple
autumn already
in its leaves

mountain fog
a gathering fugue
of wind and pine

no need
to leave the comfort zone
harvest moon

leaves rustling
there goes that
crick in my knee

early autumn
tasseled grasses
dust the air

forced retirement
the creases in his pants
fade away

late september
a sudden rain
rushes the dusk

a modest headstone
the teacher who marked me
present

one by one
the fog releases
streetlights

autumn dusk
purple daisies
wrapping up

clanging cymbals
the rooster joins
the worship

a frayed rope
hanging from a tree limb
midday heat

fire watch
the first pulses
of the pager

at dusk
a sailboat practices
coming about

contract negotiations
the summer we spent
in trees

fossil shells
inside a crumbling rock
long summer rain

evening breeze
ruffling thoughts of her
echoes of the erhu

still hummingbird
as if summer
is forever

evening swallows
the last green of summer
rolled up in bales

god of abraham
walking rain
into the sunflowers

stillness
the sound of dusk
washing ashore

driftwood
the knothole catches
a drop of rain

loggerheads
lace trails tatted
in the sand

overgrown pasture
we follow a deer trail
to the apple tree

bare soles
on cold blacktop
jackal moon

glow of light
from the hilltop hut
shooting star

fairground music
a yellow-legged gull
rides the wind

ferry gift shop
all the tourist mugs
gently clinking

short summer
a swim suit
frozen to the porch rail

above the clamor
of starlings
star stream

old pond ice
stirred by spring wind
osprey feathers

morning drizzle
the crescent of dry pavement
beneath the pinecone

waxing moon
first star flowers
unfurl

walpurgisnacht
a nuthatch enters
the scots pine

new neighbors
dandelion seeds
flying over my fence

may birdsong
hidden among
last year's cattails

shimmering heat
the satin bowerbird
tends his blue decor

overnight showers
a stray dog sipping
the sunshine

the long throat
of a pitcher plant
song of a lost bee

foot of the mountain
holding the stone
holding its story

a glimmer
on the sharpened ulu
hunter's moon

crows cawing
we add a little bourbon
to the pecan pie

thanksgiving
more stuffing pokes out
of the sofa

one more doctor
enters the room
autumn snow

crab spider
a frost moon dangles
out of reach

december dawn
the white birch is the first
to catch its light

longest winter night
the owl didn't return
to the nest

silent night
a distorted world
on the busker's sax

the depth of the lake
still in question
autumn chill

first autumn evening
at my daughter's grave
our shadows

closing my eyes
to find it
cricket's song

sphagnum moss
the secret to
where fog lives

lunar eclipse
a silverfish
inside the ephemeris

behind me
the years
fading sunflowers

a cool mist rises
from the old horse's back
the last tourist leaves

tree stump
an ant scurries across
three wars

ship's log
the marginalia
tinged with salt

blood moon
once again i check
my baby's pulse

clear stream
the one stepping-stone
under water

no details
about the procedure
quiet rain

in whichever
direction the call
to prayer

lake mist
the smudged reflections
of pines

spring haze
a forsythia's
clarity

rainy road trip
the wiper's metronome
state to state

manzanar
a butterfly's wing
beneath the millstone

blue hour
a door opens
to my past

goldfinch
shaking off
the night

spring morning
i wake
the butterfly

the pot drips
what's in it
christmas morning

hospital room
the potted plant
drops its leaves

snuffed out candles
the lingering scent
of her life

a barn owl banks
over golden meadow grass
the morning star

falling snow
the dark curve
of a red fox's tail

cold sun
the roller-shutter dawn
of factory workers

heart of winter
a sunbeam on the mat
below the letterbox

garden buddha
the subtle blue sound
of snowflakes

her origami bird
i learn
by unfolding

first snow
a stranger at
my parents' grave

wrapped in headlines
once a year our angel
comes out of hiding

holiday cleanup
putting the last spoon
to rest

just for a moment
sun
on the cut flowers

here for me
on a winter night
the kitchen chair

a bat
slips into a crack
orion rising

blizzard
the last toothpick tops
the tower

fox tracks
who was i before
i was tamed?

contrails
above brown hills
places i've never been

migrating geese 
the things we thought we needed
darken the garage

looking
not looking
roadkill

each streetlight
with its own rain 
click of mah-jong tiles

hint of frost
the spruce tipped
with jupiter

pumpkin weather
the big smiles
of the candidates

withered corn
the runner in last place
turns it on

mountain music
the poverty
in minor chords

thanksgiving
we have the wind chill
to talk about

cold snap
a bite
of the radish

the doctor says
when you reach our age
all hallow’s eve

miles to go
the grazing
roadside deer

squirrels chasing
each other
i am still alive

shadows
drifting into the garden
the hunter’s moon

saffron dawn
a leafless tree
live with birdsong

hallowe’en
a sky full of waxwings
flock to the rowan

snow before dark
the field bundled
into bales

the neighbors
all seem busy
last days of fall

almost winter
the spider
makes a repair

pumpkin carving
many faces
come to mind

evening walk
the deer must
know me by now

generations of boaters
debating the moon

condo skeleton
the hunter’s moon moves
to the penthouse floor

winter solstice
every windshield
transports a sun

perseid shower 
tiny green apples
dot the lawn

child’s grave
from birth to death
the moon

old stream 
the moon floats into
the blue hour

squabbling squirrels
i no longer remember the names
of childhood bullies

indian summer

in the dust

yellow leaves
her 30-step hopscotch
in pink

down the street
and back again
october wind

ancient courtyard
bagpipes and drums pulsate
through the cobblestones

ochre moon
the road-train’s light
in the kangaroo’s eyes

readying for bed
i open the shade
and let in the moon

new year’s eve
an invitation
to be japanese

the rasp
of a homemade broom
morning chill

master potter
almost not touching
the clay

crashing waves
mother darns a sock
by candlelight

a slight tinkling
in the dishwasher
winter evening

juncos burst
from snowy bushes
the glitter

frozen moon
a red pagoda
in the fishbowl world

midnight moon
dark stalks of spanish dagger
pierce the snow

soft rain
the clatter of young barn owls
trying their wings

bleak morning
her footprints
filled with rain

first love
all but forgotten
the meadowlark’s song

sun clears the ridge
a finch’s gold
flickers in the woodpile

eggshell fragments
what i know of the mother
i’ve never known

the cries
in the marsh rain
jacksnipes

old cemetery
the gate swings
both ways

bathed in sunlight
the day roost
of the rufous owl

climbing out
of the ocean’s roar
cliffside daisy

summer solstice
the old canal lock
cranked wide open

fragrance
fills the gap
between the flowers

bullfrog moon
silence goes
where the heron goes

crashing waves
our footprints meet
in the sand

shiny
tin can
maybe peas

teashop table
i watch rain drops
pop on the road

irises open or closed
the round mouth
of the iron bell

starry night
the space in me
she fills

sound of a car
hitting the manhole 
all-day drizzle

believing
she loves me
the blue of the sky

sun low
chins rested
on the losing oars

dusk 
sandpipers jab
the foam

outside the wake
cigarettes
dot the dark

autumn chill
the cracks i don’t
step on

autumn light
the cantor sings
a sinner’s prayer

almost a moon
the weight of the glass
as it empties

my sister’s side
of our childhood
moonlit night

early autumn
the old priest
trembling with tolls

blue asters 
god grant me
the serenity

shared grief
the splash of oars
in the fog

winter solitude 
a potato
begins to sprout

clinic waiting room 
beyond the window blinds
more walls

clear and cold
the home health nurse
late again

on the ride home
river ice breaking
our silence

feeble light
the slow melting
of eucharist

meditation 
the dent in the monk’s
head

black ice 
dad’s bloodwork
in

new friends
the potholed road
to their house

sound
over white waves
swan

pear blossoms
on the windshield
we wave goodbye

all night rain
she begins with
let’s talk

brisk breeze
the wayward kite stretching
a boy taut

graduation
a bee crawls on the cap
in front of me

barnacles
persist along the pier
our second honeymoon

my future
from beyond the fence
sheepbells

dry season ends
the scent of wet earth
saturates me

class on the quad
my eyes drift
to the afternoon moon

thunderhead
flies return quickly
to cantaloupe rinds

13th birthday
wild rose buds
angled out

childhood home
my climbing tree’s
phantom limbs

spring morning
i decline the offer
of a draw

fountain pool
all the circles
where the coins used to be

no wind
no breath to lift the sails
baby swans

the flag at half mast
orchard blossoms fill
the bigger picture

getting acquainted
some wild mint
in the garden

in a nut shell
there is never
enough room

how to dress her
for eternity 
blossom rain

on hold 
the rain
turning to snow

hill climbing 
with each step beech leaves
younger and younger

bend in the river
swans introduce their young
to the flock

fly after fly
the steady swish
of a bull’s tail

end of summer
our daughter’s vacation
gets shorter each year

near sunrise
the aspens already
alight

labor day
a crown of mushrooms
on the compost pile

morning sun
the headstone shadows
align

high tide
a plastic dump truck
moves another shell

harvest time
the doubts that leave
the doubts that remain

morning fog
a few poppies
burn through

harvest feast
the warmth
between my parents

kitchen conversation
we allow the dusk
to linger awhile

snap of a clipboard
in the all-day workshop
the heat

heat lightning 
christmas beetles
spangle the fly screen

yet again
by the river
a pair of knickers

old pond 
if only my face
would stay so smooth

bamboo bending
in the wind 
i bargain for mangos

know-it-alls talk
through rolled down windows
dusty road

village festival 
the last firework
joins the moon

aftershock
a tremor lingers
in the dog

waning summer moon
mom and i
compare hands

summer’s end 
a dog-chewed stick
by the edge of the pond

cocktail chatter
fruit flies sally
glass to glass

bottlebrush in bloom
there was a time in my life
when i wore red

breathless quiet
of a summer evening
ship in a bottle

forested ravine
just enough light let through
to gild a ripple

wildflowers
today’s news the same
as yesterday’s

hummingbird
with the wave of an arm
i work out her tattoo

never more open 
the precision
of a water lily

tangled roots
at the high tide line
a white feather

sunset stretched shadows
a strawberry seller holds out
the day’s last box

where words
fall away
all of the lily

posting the cards
almost enough snow
for a snowman

winter solstice
her first kiss
since the divorce

winter solstice
halo of a candle flame
behind a drawn shade

new year’s eve
leftovers warming
in the pot

going back
into the memento box
everything fits

festival of lights 
the old dog
begging biscuits

my tea cup
still too hot to hold
the shortest day

last day of the year 
red plastic roses
fading in the shop window

dried anemone
in a diary
no when no where no why

thinking
the unthinkable 
old cat

summer garden
the full stretch
of the hose

deepening winter
he listens
to her womb

alone tonight 
the calla lily curves
into shadow

family reunion
fragments of old photo albums
on the porch floor

winter moon
fading echoes
of the coyote’s howl

crows bicker
in the morning light 
our twisted sheets

chinese pork stall
the deep valley
in a chopping log

cloudy sky 
a little boy imitates
the cuckoo

jazz in the night
leaves blow across
the empty intersection

the long night
a warm glow
from the baker’s window

city morning
a crane lifts its shadow
up the wall

farmer’s market
the bee balm lady
drawing all the butterflies

sun shower
the surveillance camera
fixed on a puddle

sunlit lake
her face
after baptism

summer writing camp 
sound of a skill saw
through the barn window

late-day sun
the cavity of a snag
laced with webs

eucalyptus trees
sway in the hot wind 
a taste of grit

summer evening
a muskrat rests its head
on driftwood

afternoon haze
the slow wind-up
of a cicada

unemployed
a pillar of mayflies
swirling in the sun

ninth-inning tie
the slow shadow of the pitcher
approaches the mound

windy dusk
a dog waits by
the collapsed bridge

airless night
dust from the window frame
on my fingers

white hydrangeas
motherhood is missing
from my resume

vacation’s end 
windshield wipers in synch
with the radio

autumn wind
the leaves are going
where i’m going

oh! oh! oh!
the mouths of japan’s women
on a woodcut

the highs and lows
of our conversation
the dog’s eyebrows

on a slip of paper
a number without a name 
autumn drizzle

a friend has died
migrating geese
still migrating

black mesa
a water serpent winds
around the clay pot

windswept corner 
every time
a surprise

quiet day
a falling leaf
touches my face

moonbeams 
the thin legs
of a new frog

frog song
a bromeliad
gathers rain

scenic viewpoint 
a kite string leads down
to the ice cream van

sunglare
the rasp as my clam rake
uncovers tin cans

tea-colored creek 
live salmon make their way
past the dead

willow shadows
the drip of water
from a moose’s chin

mockingbird
not a hint
of this record high

the wave turning back 
the deep blue
of the seashell

up from the harbor
fish smells follow
the donkey trail

midsummer stream
a grackle dips its beak
in shimmer

scent of lemon
the glint of a sunbeam
on polished pews

home from the lawyer
my old soft shimmy
and a bowl of huckleberries

first light
filling the orchard 
squeak of the pump

what my words can’t explain 
the autumn sun
on your back

quiet afternoon 
leaves on her desk
arranged by color

creaking gate 
the crows evenly spaced
between the headstones

summer night
slowly he disappears
into cicada song

the angle
of the fruit picker’s ladder
autumn light

continuing heat
how does the maple know
that it’s autumn?

holding her close
the pulse
of cricket song

silted river
an old doe turns
to face the flow

incessant rain
a book from a library
that no longer exists

spring rain
the door to the cuckoo clock
about to open

cottonwood rattle 
the wordlessness
of his final days

hillside cemetery
all gravestones
face the view

blue sky
the love
i never had

lily of the valley
she hangs her bathing suit
on a branch

cicada song
the slow drift of creek foam
long into the night

summer moon
a willow’s shadow
dapples her grave

biting into cucumber
the mountain wind
touches my cheek

golden sun
a gong resonates
through bamboo

lazy river
drifting toward the equinox
on an inner tube

windows open 
the sound of summer
in all the rooms

new year’s eve 
rubbing velvet
the wrong way

winter moon
a smudged fingerprint
on the inkstone

white dawn
the calf’s breath
on the udder

magpie nestlings 
redgum widow-makers
creak in the wind

gray skies 
a kestrel
cries its kill

fireside
a piece of jigsaw
slips into place

waking beside you
the room glows
with snowlight

april sleet
oatmeal sticks
to the pot

light rain 
the open beak
of the bird

whistling back to them
i can’t find the right key
tree frogs

evening heat
sifting through the screen door
their laughter

patio dinner
our plastic chairs
slowly chill

autumn air
two crows on the roof move
closer together

fog with rain
the usual junk
in our mailbox

autumn rain
a baseball card softens
in the bicycle spokes

exchanging pleasantries
while hammering
crab shells

shorter days 
kink in the end
of a lizard’s tail

morning fog 
he closes all the windows
i just opened

saying goodbye
the fence we painted
face to face

football practice
the coach perfects
his game voice

water colors
i paint the spaces
between waves

ruffling
my found feather
a breath

an old flame
the boat nudges
spent cattails

hot day
a crow makes
the hawk flap

rows of corn
the farmer’s
bad posture

surf’s edge
the shape of wind
in her hair

lilies in bloom
i launch the boat
in another place

lily pads
not touching
noon heat

big sky
a pronghorn
hops a fence

storm clouds 
the cow’s belly
rumbles

beanstalks 
the kids want
taller stakes

suncatchers
in the shop window
she smiles back

long afternoon 
the ceiling fan
turning the wrong way

summer rain
scent of lavender
in the mop water

am i so old?
the sound of leaves
weighing rain

father’s day walk
the pace
of the smallest grandchild

dappled sunlight
men group around
their frothy beers

silence after thunder
the new neighbor calling in
her children

through the sick boy’s straw
the loud emptiness
of his milkshake glass

longest day
the smell of chemicals
in the waiting room

birdsong
a blind child touches
my smile

flowering clover
slows my mowing
bee after bee

big top
a white moth passing
under the trapeze

a flip-flop
in the middle of the street 
the heat

amid placards
pigeons settle
for crumbs

chasing the puppy
chasing the wind
white butterflies

clipped grass
a rabbit keeps an eye on
saint francis

summer camp
children play
with sunlight

longest day 
a mosquito finds
my ear

evening news 
each cloud carries
part of the sunset

leaden sky
the sharp angle
of the swallow’s turn

old car graveyard
mama moves her kittens
to the back seat

colors of flowers
i promise the children
she’s in heaven

spring cleaning
she pauses a while
at the bay windows

afternoon shadows
temple stones
stacked and numbered

no man’s land
a boy flies a kite
above rubble

grown wild
the spot where i buried
the last of my pets

funeral flowers
bright pollen staining
the fresh linen

the aegean
so blue
this wild anemone

bristlecone pine 
older
than our religions

city dusk
the warmth
of an atm booth

blaming
at some point the rain
became snow

first snowfall
a chirp to remind us
the battery’s low

midnight mass
the stained glass infant glows
from within

quiet twilight
grandpa prunes thin limbs
with his pocketknife

full moon
the static
in his touch

longest night 
the death poem
rustles

moonless night 
our neighbor’s telephone
rings and rings

dead of winter
relighting
the pilot flame

calling home 
the color of mother’s voice
before her words

sundown 
the sound as he scrapes
mud from his boots

late afternoon light
through the window blinds 
a drift of leaves

evening cricket
squash vines disappearing
into other beds

halloween 
catfish bob
for ripe persimmons

hazy harvest moon
the face i met
when our skin was smooth

mackerel sky
a concord grape bursts
between my teeth

she leaves
the gate open
indian summer

autumn dusk
a man standing too long
on the street corner

moonlit night
through the storm door
the raccoon’s face

falling leaves
i whisper my secrets
to an old photo

evening light
the heron takes
a new stance

sunset
the cuckoo repeats
his morning song

summer dusk
i douse the young fig tree
with today’s dishwater

fireworks
the teenagers
whisper

city fireflies
i don’t know which window
is yours

daybreak
mayfly wings
on the cat

evening calm
a cricket appears
on my windowsill

meteor shower
turtle hatchlings
head for the sea

flickering buzz
of the pool hall sign
summer night

the short night 
sleeping on top
of the covers

long morning shadows 
half shells flipped over
by the tide

lifting fog
the wing-whistle
of a mourning dove

the comfort
of her conversation
gentle rain

foam flowers
the pull of sand under
my inner child

salmon ladder
the surrounding trees
stuffed with eagles

at the goldfish grave
we form a circle
of river stones

sixth anniversary
acorns between the cracks
of the deck boards

autumn twilight
my breath in and out
with the waves

border collie
rounding up
the tide

the hooked fish’s
last gasp
its eye on me

autumn mist 
wrapped
in grandma’s shawl

honeysuckle
where you first hear
the river

roaring wind 
my little thoughts
for tomorrow

ocean breeze
a pitcher and his interpreter
walk to the bullpen

hundreds of gulls
feeding their chicks
he points at the dead one

first warm day 
the woodpecker works
a shiny stump

dark hallway
an explosion
of cut lilac

muddy gloves
a colorful bunch
of empty flower pots

next to the tracks
an old bottle
catching dawn

years later
mist still gathers
in the same hollow

a tap
on the shoulder 
a raindrop

town cannon
a finch with twigs vanishes
down the muzzle

night rain
the bedroom fills
with memories

we let
our secrets out
empty nest

every spring
the same question
returning bees

sunrise
a shoot half out
of its seed skin

faint scent of lilacs
i wonder what he means
by we

paper cranes
the yellow birch unpleats
its leaves

beachcombing
a wave picks up and drops
the sun’s reflection

lantern light
the river slips
through our fence

first buds 
the oriole sings
its love song

from the secret place
the mother dog
with her litter

sun-dappled sidewalk
shadows of new leaves play
on stains of the old

moonless night
foxfire where there was
a forest road

the darkness
of long-empty stables 
quaker meetinghouse

three-quarter moon
the windmill rusted
into silence

sunset and moonrise 
if only i could learn
to be faithful

october frost
the tread of the landlord
on crisp brown leaves

grandmother
the stoop
in her shadow

soldiers coming home
three wasps circle where
the nest used to hang

click-clack
of the bead curtain 
the sway of her hips

a sioux tunic
embroidered with elk teeth
behind smudged glass

thin marsh ice
my father attempts
an embrace

a sparkler fizzles
into darkness
year’s end

ripening wheat 
he whistles
the latest love song

i don’t know
what to tell her
bruised mint

dog days 
pulling off
cockleburs

summer’s eve
i turn the glider cushion
to its clean side

late summer
crossing the memory
of a stream

beach cabanas
flapping in the breeze
the sound of idle chatter

handshake
not a kiss
starless night

summer evening
a cook in the alley points
his knife at the moon

muggy evening
a door slams shut
in the dead man’s house

sunset
i absorb the stillness
in the trees

cabbages starting
to touch each other
late-summer heat

oars in unison
slicing the river
slicing the moon

dimly lit porch
the newspaper boy
no longer a boy

the storm’s rain
rising as mist
wings of a barn owl

a curlew
holds its second note
shadows lengthening

small town
hospital
sound of the typewriter

night time 
moths queuing
at the cash machine

late summer flowers
the joy
of a good sneeze

settlers’ cemetery
an old yew creaks
at noon

gleam of mudflats 
a snail retreats
into its shell

stars begin to fade
so much music
from unseen birds

slow train journey
a gull’s shadow
takes the lead

worn out day 
rocks the river left
on top

midsummer
a speedboat slices
the lake in half

scorching heat 
the shrilling of cicadas
pierces me

nameless falls
a water ouzel
at rainbow’s end

dead man’s curve 
a screech owl veers
toward the river

after each
turn of the page
the fly

thunderclap 
the sun tea
darkens

secret campsite
chilled beer clinks
in midstream

a stream begins
in the middle of the trail
thrush beyond thrush

day-long downpour
dressing the children
for the exwife’s wedding

the longest day
he stills the mower
at twilight

rippled sand
each trough cradles
the glint of shells

midsummer day 
tilting a longneck
all the way up

morning sun
the honeybee’s abdomen
pulses

haggling over price 
the frozen jaw
of a warehouse tuna

midsummer sea
silver ripples
from an otter’s back

beachside cafe
a bit of sand
in the waiter’s ear

thunder 
a looping inchworm’s
rhythmic slide

on a field
of ripe tomatoes
the empty wooden crates

every place taken
on the finch feeder
september rain

split milkweed pods 
getting to know him
at his memorial

a leaf 
its descent stopped
by a child

wembley stadium 
a blackbird sings
to empty seats

labor day 
scraping mold off
government cheese

breathe in
breathe out
autumn moon

autumn dusk 
a fine layer of mist
over the cricket pitch

first mouthful
of a warm cider doughnut
scarlet hillsides

moon at the window
i cut another eye
from the potato

kneading dough 
a cold wind gathers
yellow leaves

first frost
the birds that stay
the birds that go

mother’s keepsakes
the questions
i never asked

quilting circle
we rearrange pieces
of our lives

fishbowl
telling a child
about death

a handful of kindling
in the fireplace 
moving day

deep woods
an old stone wall
buried in leaves

making resolutions
piles of fallen needles
beneath the pine

house sitting
the warmth
of my friend’s cat

winter evening
my boy’s
thin shoulders

the geyser erupts 
for a moment i forget
the smell of sulfur

conversation
above the kitchen clatter
summer evening

stepping stones
a dragonfly lands
on my shoe

zinnias
why yes my favorite
was harpo

the dog and i
on the moonlit dock
scratching bug bites

august evening
grandfather whittles
the light away

this sky
too blue to last
chickadee

vertical dive 
the ocean folds over
a tern

first night out
on their own
my seedlings

spring breeze 
a mosquito in the sap
of a beaver stump

day after memorial day
a rolling trashcan filled
with flags

field stones
the broadness
of the farmer’s back

fragile truce 
beet seedlings
in a crooked row

milkmoon 
my daughter nurses
her plastic doll

spring hail
the horse rolls its tongue
over the fencepost

market stroll 
rotating a coin
in my pocket

summer solstice
the long shadow cast
by a plastic t-rex

swimmers
at the middle of the lake
graduation night

in blinding snow
sweet silage smell
from a door left open

winter morning
the flag-draped coffins
of a few

winter sun
the last photographs
in mother’s album

all day rain
a whistle of wind
breaks the rhythm

the ewe
nudges her lamb once more 
ravens cawing

more snow
the nag of an itch
i can’t reach

thin clouds
the ladle steams
above my bowl

rain-lashed valley
the ram’s wool matted
over his bones

bevy of sparrows
a creek breaks
its winter banks

a brown leaf
dangles among the buds 
the ambulance arrives

open train doors
unsettle a hush within
cicada wind

super blood moon
the crab apples
ripening

autumn breeze
sunlight slides up and down
the spider's thread

one tree
then the rest of them
autumn wind

crescent moon
the itch of new skin
under the burn

around bend
after bend
hunger moon

shadows lengthen
the key hangs
on a rusty nail

woven
into the sound of wind
slivers of bamboo

august sun
when war was fought
with water guns

ebb tide
the shell sings
a parting note

first fall day
my black umbrella
starts to mutter

late school bus
she loosens the cap
of an acorn

old comic books
my son meets the boy
i used to be

where the wild things
might have been
the autumn sky

coffee cup rings
when was the last time
we talked

family dinner
our teen speaks
in hashtags

loon call
the growing gaps
between the stars

cloudless sky

picks the span of the barn

after the rain

a wish to bottle it
for winter listening

waving their blue
dragonfly tails

of old denims

of dead bug

on a sheep we know

smoke from the leaf piles
hangs in the trees

another season
corn leaves rasping
in the dry wind

sea cliffs
guano glowing faintly
in the moonlight

gone south
the geese butterflies
and something in me

autumn wind
neighbor's leaf pile
moves in with mine

adjusts its grip

twinkling
prison lights

the dying cries
of his bagpipes

on the logging truck

on a silk scarf

of a coconut tree

of southern women

in the water weeds

what a river did
to what an ocean did

the amish neighbors' horse
nuzzles ours

the snap
of grasshoppers

we try to read
between the lines

of a swan's neck

under spring stars
the horses wander

again

our words turn
into mist

a robin builds her nest
in the letterbox

across the river
the other side
of my family

big enough to hold
a dream or two

evening news
she places both hands
on her baby bump

picking parsley
a leopard frog
evades my hand

in a blue mason jar
twilight breeze

into forever

in the park

stamped in the sand

a young boy
straddles a cannon

i give my order to
a mouth and chin

an ant circles
the sink drain

july 4th
the dog follows
her piccolo notes

little league mound
a whiff of his hero's
sunscreen

red wine
all the memories
a glass can hold

first year away
christmas lights
on a docked ship

a blank page
sheltering the sky

my touchy mood
pieces of cracked shell
stuck to the egg

bonsai trees
the length
of our lives

a long flight
getting to forget
the person beside me

with nowhere
left to turn
wind song

dusk
inching in
the rabbit

swerving
to miss a flattened cat
new year's day

maine winters
the young maples girdled
by mouse teeth

summer nap
aspen shadows quiver
on the window shade

sicilian villages
i dream
in terracotta

gathering
wool

seeds

summing up
my adolescence
loosestrife

assuming
all else fails

in an old hat

warm afternoon
the slow accumulation
of cherry pits

mid-august
a bit of dusk
on the oak leaves

the muddy aisle
to the melons

end of summer
a newborn tightly wrapped
to its mother

curve of the wood
on the small of my back
his old school chair

first day of school
a circle of flattened grass
where the pool was

left to fall
the barn folding down
into sumac

making the best
of a rainy weekend
wild mushrooms

autumnal equinox
the chill
as she turns away

the depth
of what i yearn for
autumn shadows

taking a breather
along the trail
the scent of sage

a slight adjustment
to the rear-view mirror
autumn dusk

bell shimmer
the bright peals
of moonlight

one owl
now two
moon through the pines

falling leaves
we exchange
the gesture to call

someone fixes
a stuck horn
autumn evening

for its vines
an old shed
still stands

railroad ties
the distance
between bones

day moon
the bark of the blue ash
horse-rubbed white

each autumn morning
the night
a little closer

city sunset
darkness rising
brick by brick

something triggers
the security lights
late night chill

gathering dark
a broken antler
in the leaf litter

winter chill
i press harder
on the rolling pin

pings of sleet
adding a fourth button
to her gingerbread man

winter night
tapioca pearls glint
in a chipped bowl

a long winter
just the noise of my spoon
in the soup

deep winter
waking to the smell
of yesterday's stew

morning stillness
the empty bird table
buried under snow

perennials
in the garden
she left behind

hint of autumn
the lost look
in the dog's eyes

september
deeper midnights
for the moths

bonfire sparks
we spend the night not wanting
the night to end

stop drop and roll
autumn begins
with an acorn

of a newsman's slicker

turbulence
my imagination
a flight risk

removing the moss
off a carved heart

between the branches
i am six again

the ebb-and-flow
of sunset clouds

my shadow
into the mountain's shadow

the best viewpoint
tagged by gulls

to meet it

the open mouth
of a water snake

fumbled kiss

from a hollyhock

step by step
i pick my way home
early blackberries

wildfire sunset
our clasped hands
tighter

shifting gears
i release my clutch
on summer

vacation's end
sunlight catches the ring
in a bull's nostrils

roadside wildflowers
i whisper their names aloud
before autumn takes them

a male spider
touches her web
the dance begins

sultry afternoon
undulating through cattails
a watersnake's wake

circus
the tiger walks its shadow
outside the cage

ceiling fan
a rock band sticker
takes a joy ride

i echo
the silence

i tell him

the answered phone

melts in the sun

licks my face

with a nightcap

building a birdhouse
his sandpaper voice

the shape of his hands
becomes a memory

extending my word
on scrabble

wrapped in amber

frosted grass
i warm my hands
on the horse's breath

end of the month
a line of white breaths
outside the blood bank

after my plane crash
every color
every breath

frog pose
the first few patters
of morning rain

beneath the ski lift

begins

stepping stones
rising in the pond
curve of a carapace

teaching my son
how to drive
objects appearing closer

pointing in the same direction
father and son

headlights tail lights
weave around the mountain
a firefly night

so many thoughts
that come and go
not catching fish

we make plans
to make plans

the time it takes
to believe my eyes

of moonlight

starlight

contained in farewell

of paste

little lives

of tugboats bumping
against the tub

closer to heaven

and old growth

to believe

before the river splits
into another name

from the far bank

strobe the river

in my shadow

in the stream
a lone fisherman
that once was me

there not there
grebes

my daughter finds the key
to the music box

in the night

releases its litter

measuring a life
from crocus
to crocus

the tunes my father
would whistle

the children
jump back

with her last breath

in the singing bowl

in the ocean

steaming rice
the everydayness
of winter

closed factory
the ants
working

spring drizzle
for half of the day
i click 'delete'

pear blossom spirals
otters copulate
in the pond

what remains
of this twilight
orange blossoms

first day of summer
only push pins
on the notice board

fallow field
over the loam
an ant and its burden

beach wedding
the day dad lost me
in the waves

island dreams
sails set
on washday

no vacancy
a few seagulls
on the painted rock

a vixen
and her feisty kit
the fresh-cut grass

war news
a white butterfly lands
on the wailing wall

sudden clouds
a wind-blown towel
evacuates the beach

talk of life
on distant planets
wild lupine

mosquitoes
the stone buddha
remains centered

indian summer
the illusion of being
in love

late season apples
i get a postcard
from my tour guide

night settles
a blackbird's song
ripples the tarn

red oak leaf
on the wind
on its own

toast and coffee
on golf-themed dishes
freezing rain

a plane tree
every leaf falling
in its own way

fallen feather
the weight of sunlight
on stone

thanksgiving
overflowing with children
of children

new resolutions
a blizzard swirls and settles
in the snow globe

snowing again
a stranger calls me
sunshine

thanksgiving light
the coot pair's long wakes
becoming one

around ancient fires
their shadows danced
on the great stones

pine wind
we read the names
on neighboring headstones

wail of a siren
a worried look
in the old dog's eyes

cedar
which childhood friend
explained a hope chest

while the light holds
fieldfares on windfalls

night
last firefly seals
conversation

cup
the wine's surface tension
uneven pulse

bamboo
still have trouble answering
big questions

clouds
dream to become
clown

sprinkler arc
a cranefly's
patterned wings

a swing
and a slide
small town

the waves
slowly splitting the rocks
splitting the waves

at the bottom of the sea
cosmonauts
drift blue

in their own way
howling at the moon
katydids

kids leap
over a starry night
chalk art

it's a start she says
snapping the wild
asparagus

dry heat
the thin shadow
of a lizard's tail

home from the wake
into my dark house
a firefly

the river's mouth
no end to the end
of the journey

something
on my mammogram
starless night

winter cold
a few feathers
among slight pink bones

rain on the wind
the flimsiness of words
on a condolence card

scent of snow
unable to recall
my father's voice

the stepping stone
wobbles
winter stars

snowflake
a child
lost in the crowd

how they touch
the sky
ceremonial pines

making sculptures
in a string of suet
pecking wrens

paper cranes
the folded sheets she placed
in her hope chest

last rites
i watch her eyes
let go of me

spring morning
the prayer strip's shadow
almost transparent

goosebumps
brookies rising
for mayflies

cut peonies
a file of ants
escapes the vase

morning mist
the piper's song fades
beyond the valley

riding the bull thistle
for more than 8 seconds
the goldfinch

a mango leaf
the entire world
of the unnamed bug

mammogram
the color of the ewe
beneath her fleece

first light
a persistence
of flickers

a farmer's grin
corn just high enough
to rustle

a drowsy wasp
three generations
of dusty letters

descending
into dragonflies
morning mist

the library
just for the smell

newspapers piled
on the neighbor's porch
fall melancholy

through corn tassels
the sway
of a silo

morning sidewalk
flattened leaves and the imprints
of those blown away

the squirrel chatters
what he knows
a shaft of light

the dumbwaiter
groans as it comes up
carrying dust

watching
the wind arrive
tree by tree

weathered barn
the farmer's wife
studies her hands

dawn
petal by petal
the dogwood

wedding week
all the wild horses
in the sun

she's fading
the hum of bees
from the lavender

iced espresso
with shaved chocolate
we talk of carbon footprints

at the summit
one who names
one who views

hanging bridge
the pot water wobbling
on her hip

scarlet roses
we give them something
to talk about

election promises
piled high
thunderheads

deep woods
a caterpillar
lets in the sun

butterflies pinned
and spread under glassthe poems
in my new book

high noon
the vulture's circle
lowers

roadside sweet corn
the girl tans her legs
next to the money

queen anne's lace
we get the last spot
in the hotel parking lot

blueberry picking
voices from another row
from another time

summer day
the cloud that didn't move
gone

endless heat
the shopping cart squeaks
to one side

highway gas station
the cashier's knowledge
of geography

summer dresses
two girls ask whether
i've found their god

rolling green hills
crowned with wild mustard
the wanderlust in me

the argument over
i remove a pebble
from my shoe

in the wind
my shadow struggles
for control

sunshine on the door
a schoolgirl wants to know
who blesses the priest

swept floor
the dust
i shall become

above the hospital
a get well balloon
let go

what the ocean
has played with
a pocketful of smooth stones

spring blossoms
a stranger
blesses me

omg
both rain and sunlight
on a blue jay's tail

cherry blossoms
where do we go
from here

old wagon road
hidden in prairie grass
a sunken grave

old pick-up
slowly being overtaken
by a forest

leaves that touch
and leaves that don't
summer solitude

a place in this world
shells being ground to grains
by the incoming tide

afternoon tea
our love
steeping

deeper and deeper
into the foxglove
dusk

the question
trails off
shooting star

salt and roses
i follow a path
to the beach

clam dig
the quiet passing
of a sail

the gardener mows
into the shadows
summer evening

thunderbolt
emptiness of the street
between our houses

swamp gas
a lone bullfrog
fills the lake

too late
to make it right
acorn caps

clatter of tools
in the auto shop
an autumn evening

evening train whistle
my grandfather's habit
of checking his watch

riderless animals
on the merry-go-round
moon halo

sudden chill
mouse droppings
in the stairwell

rain all day
a place i cannot reach
in mother's eyes

autumn leaves
the wind takes the shape
of absence

moonmist through the trees
still not believing
there's life on mars

two of her steps
for each one of his
first frost

the low tide
of a moonless night
crabs click the rocks

autumn colors
the scent
of a match being lit

standing water
in the horseshoe pit
summer's end

lullaby of rain
another pinch of saffron
in the pumpkin soup

morning stillness
the cat's tongue adds
a rhythm of ripples

the smell of it
in a summer wind
mill town

talk of adoption
white cabbage moths meet
in midair

father's day
a puff of steam
takes him back

family reunion
three generations
cheat at musical chairs

petroglyphs
the river cloudy
through cottonwoods

gardenia breeze
somewhere in the dark
a child counts

new york summer
the hotdog vendor
knows my name

too much sky
where the tree
used to be

l'heure bleue
fireflies brighter
than the city lights

christmas photo
in all four smiles
the same tension

ethiopian new year
steam rises from a pile
of sheep hides

whiskey over ice
the bite
of her kiss

overcast sky
the shelter cat will not leave
her cage

eucalyptus bark
the two of us look
into another world

winter night
reaching a page
someone has folded

first snow
the nudity of
pigs

late-winter sunshine
he flips a piece of heel
from the toaster

another sunrise
a chance to do the things
i could have done before

motel night
in the paper cup an inch
of sumi ink

winter tales
old applewood
burning blue

back porch light
silence thickens
with snow

a moody wind
teases the wattle
winter's end

an ant
at the foot
the mountain

rising sun
the fawn's bed of meadowsweet
unfolds from the dew

winter fog
an old man turns back
into a tree

my veins turn
a deeper blue
winter twilight

crepuscular rays
a lipizzan foal
begins to suckle

rippling pond
what's left
of his words

chrysalis
what will be
will be

california light
a swallow loops
between afternoon and dusk

crickets
the stars twinkling
in their rhythm

horn
of a freight train bordering on
dream

things that can't be
shrinkwrapped
autumn moon

another
flying dream
wild orchids

black spider
clutching her egg sac
night wraps around the moon

faint gulf breeze
the jazz player settles
on a new curb

everyday walk
the air is full
of other places

anniversary
the stench
of chrysanthemums

a fox den
full of fallen leaves
the fading trail

housewarming
the ashes in the fireplace
resettle

last seen
by ancient kings
winter comet

three minute eggs
making the most of the time
that's left

small town
the dogs
on main street

nowhere left
for the needle to go
hunger moon

cajun christmas
a fiddler fills the room
with silent night

fresh snow
the warmth surrounding
your bones

new year's eve
after a few drinks
we promise to change

bitter cold
ladybirds cluster at the tips
of the pine

the faint rattle
in my broken watch
winter

push mower
scents of mint lavender dill
sliced into grass

heat shimmer
a heron drinks
from the horse trough

reunion trip
a raindrop squirms
up the windscreen

lush canopy
the symmetry of orchids
far from home

egret at dusk
looking for shapes
in the shadows

another dry day
the storm bird
keeps singing

the sweat cooling
under my straw hat
waterfall breeze

bridging the gap
between leisure and sport
shady trees

slime mold
how to know this life
is the one worth living

flowing river
my mother recalls
india's partition

winter burial
the resurrection
of old photos

a stalactite
of dried soap on the dispenser
flu season

vase of snapdragons
a log in the fireplace
flares

the planets aligning
i rearrange
my night

simmering milk
my baby sister's bonnet
feathered with frost

snow on old snow
twilight slowly
swallows the room

winter blues
the same orange liqueur
my father drank

i'll have
what they are having
winter roses

spring morning
the baby sleepers
hanging on the balcony

over the rainbow
and back
to the metronome

a warm night
from the hill-top
other hills

knowing the river's wide
only by its sound
night deepens

oceans with names
waves leaping over
one another

desert stars
i end all thought
of moderation

shades of evening
through the shipwreck's ribs
the cries of a plover

slight breeze
the silent spin of
wooden wind chimes

lost in the woods
the woods
of my childhood

long stem daisies
i return for a moment
to the summer of love

open road
playing catch-up
with the clouds

all thats left
a strand of seaweed
in the shower

the broken binding
of my high school yearbook
new year's eve

mid-january
ornament hooks still hide
in the carpet

at the bottom
of the kindling box
dad's hooch

snowdrifts
i shovel the froth
from my latte

white-tailed deer
still building my trust
six years later

at the back of the cupboard
spices
from another millennium

the street
turns nameless
midnight snow

blizzard
the pleasure
of going nowhere

watching stars
i think of mice
and the crumbs they live on

solstice nightdreams of fingerlings
baked with salmon

flower show
waiting my turn
to smell the roses

whipbird's call
the morning
cut in two

skinny dipping
open mouths
of trumpet vines

along the drip line
of century old redwoods
forget-me-nots

first summer days
my neighbor's navel
visible again

climbing the path
from the trout lake
pipe smoke

low tide
birds flock to the color
wet

childhood laughter
the taste of
field fresh corn

hint of rain
she turns to me
in her sleep

autumn moon
the leaves on her windowsill
folding shut

the scent of wood fires in fog
i start the day

smell of gasoline
stacked by the stump of the tree
the rest of the tree

new year's eve
to new year's day
the unlit candle

first snow flurries
the shape of the day
after retirement

cold breezes
the grand canyon swallows
a sunrise photo

their cries
should mean something
twilight geese

tail up head under
how the wood duck
spends christmas

a new year
the garbage can's lid
frozen shut

snowflakes
stealthily the cat joins me
under the quilt

dune roses
denim softened
by clothesline sun

the day ends
as it begins
heron in the sun

twilight
the horse's silhouette
heads for the barn

when luxury
is a therm-a-rest pad
scent of pine

no home
to come home to
star-gazer lilies

no clock
in the post office
august afternoon

back porch swing
the little league umpire
retires his mask

august evening
the gentle light
of the hamm's beer sign

tonight's stars
how long will it take
for my light to reach them?

purple dawn
the stillness of a crane hook
in the city port

my rebellion
taped inside
a cardboard box

african hip-hop
on a tin roof
the rainy season begins

the whiffling skeins
becoming individuals
becoming one

dead thistles
the feel of a key
in a rusty lock

a taste of apple wine
the deepening dusk
of river light

tai chi class
a turquoise damselfly
pauses with me

homecoming
the frogs won't let me sleep
the moon won't let me sleep

wine party
everyone sipping
the waning moon

autumn evening
the city wrapped
in rain

morning drizzle
so many umbrellas
left behind

snowmelt
the taste of a foot-long
waterfall

beneath the street lights
the shapes the rain
makes of us

kindergarten quiet
first seedlings
in styrofoam cups

soap bubbles
how softly mother
bursts into laughter

long-term parking
a nest with eggs
in the wheel well

spring night
everywhere the sounds
of falling water

spring wind
loosening my grip
on the handlebars

asthma
the tight whorl
of fiddleheads

spring blossoms
i slice the fruits
as father did

on each tip
of the three-fingered cactus
snow

steam rising
from the dog's pee
witching hour

winter time
the open woods where
once we listened for owls

valentine month
from her mouth to mine
fresh strawberries

penitence
an absence of color
connects the stars

winter dusk
old fingers remember
an old tune

depth of winter
a dying pigeon
flaps away my help

winter hawks
mother's silence
follows me home

the barbecue sizzling
winter rain

ice melting
the shape of the branch
it fell from

abandoned orchard
full of weeds
and ripe fruit

those early dates
when we walked home
in the long-legged moonlight

grass in the breeze
again the beetle
spreads its torn wings

so many ravens
the scarecrow looks
somewhere else

mother's worries
wind generators chop
into the fog

moon viewing
a different angle
when we kiss

feather
on a string
not for long

changing seasons
from donating to goodwill
to shopping there

cool in the basement
a wooden whisky box
of my father's tools

giacomettiacross the book a fly's
long shadow

two or three robins
the final day
of a winter sale

deckle-edged snapshots
the shadow
of a doubt

altar flowers
she knows the one
he would touch

an ordinary wake
pictures of a life
outside the box

too soon to tell
the slight swelling
of a flower bud

in the rest home lounge
the silent piano
its line of cracked keys

cemetery gate
my grandfather shouts
from the other side

uneven tree rings
stories of my father
i've never heard

point zero two
interest
daylight savings

adding vinegar
to set the dye
good friday

we idle
with the car
yellow leaves

distant train whistle
the rainy afternoon
full of stepdaughters

dark reflections
a tufted duck's
wake of light

remembrance day
a nimbus of crumbs
around her teacup

thanksgiving snow
the military park
bone white

as if this house
might drift away
cobweb moorings

gathering dusk
rooftop to treetop
the echo of crows

tract house wall
beyond it the land
belonging to rabbits

withered field
police tape tangled
in the scrub

morning-after note
thawing snow exposes
unraked leaves

an old reed song
my boat drifts
in that direction

rustling leaves
it's not that hard
to be born again

just past sunrise
a patch of red in the
woodpecker hole

old neighborhood
i inhale
my ghost

awakened
by moonlight
an old regret

ikebana
a cobweb links
man to heaven

following the source
of a winged shadow
day moon

crossing the bridge
where he jumped
the city lights

abandoned house
the broken milk box
filled with moonlight

birthday's end
the hole in the fridge left
by the cake box

smell of rain
on the early wind
scurry of ants

dandelion seeds
what's the color
of your dream

this thought
that thought
bees in the catmint

small town wedding
the groom waiting under
the apple tree

flipped rock
scurry of vivid colors

from the plane
the island turns
into a tadpole

last lilac
the love life
of my mind

contemplation garden
we decide
five minutes is enough

served with a sprig of mint
his betrothal's
sudden end

a dust jacket
without its book
summer deepens

my memory fails
his clothes
still hold his shape

hospital discharge
we pick our way
around puddles

qing ming
putting a heart-shaped red plum
by my mother's picture

street renovation
the watchmaker's shop
stays the same

endless rain
mother's silver beginning
to tarnish

first day of spring
the lingering scent
of rare books

rainy runway
the pilot's muffled voice
throughout the cabin

painting daylight
i gather yellow
from memory

every year her flowers planted
in even straight rows
the way we were raised

old couple hand in hand
the fresh brown earth
ready for turning

maple shade
a quilt pallet spread
with paper dolls

paulownia leaf
a street child curled
amidst the squalor

sergeant's orders
soldiers cock their rifles
at the azure sky

trumpet vine
hummingbird shadows
touch in passing

scent from the river
when there's only
the evening star

from neighbor
to neighbor
rhubarb crowns

midday heat
the heron's world
in a ripple

one water strider's
pause overlaps another's
afternoon deepens

saffron sunset
the workers in the rice field
but silhouettes

sunset reflected
in windows of the house
i no longer own

dead of winter
the worry we trade
back and forth

winter morning
wind soughing through
the subway tunnel

thickening fog
on the hillside
sheep and ghost sheep

the river churning
thru the gorgethe son who chose
the wrong career

the neighbor
sunbathing topless
magnolia blossoms

through wind-blown snow
clatter of the last train

hot house fan
spins our shadows
into the orchids

optic nerve
a scarlet cardinal
hops across

the clank
of the flagless halyard
first spring alone

morning stiffness
another year's daffodil
from the bulb

steam museum
the carousel horse
bares its teeth

scenic overlook
the coming and going
of flies

tinny radio
a sweat bee circles
her painted toes

sure of the wind
the red-tailed hawk
alone as ever

a caged hamster
in candle glow
tent city

between breaths
following the white
of this butterfly

high noon
my own shadow
abandons me

family reunion
the click
of worry beads

heat lightning
does it show
in my eyes

pet cemetery
the wildflowers
always return

calendar filled
with doctor's appointments
fallen jacaranda

downy feathers
along the spring path
a red-tail's cry

late spring
the dew rounder
on some leaves

mud dauber nest
filling a porch corner
my son calls home

sooner in the bluer
violets dusk

green thorns
and a few
the color of wine

april-cool night
the lake with all the sounds
needed for sleep

buttercups
the haltered pony
on its back

one day
you and i
and all these flowers

day crescent moon
a witchetty grub
unearthed

boink
of an aluminum bat
red sky

so many stars
the burden of
small talk

rusted railway
a quick wind unzips
the grasses

not supposed to
turn out this way
tumbleweed

another crabhouse
lunch ultimatum

vireo's song
echoing from the kiva cliff
eight centuries later

arboretum
an airplane's deep drone
over the crepe myrtle

afternoon lull
a mercy bullet
for the rabid dog

sundown
the swirl of caught fish
in the pail

sunset sail
his champagne promise
to get well

evening stars
the ladder to the top
of the silo

half moon
leaving half the night
to stars

drifting fog
there was a time
i would've said yes

shadows moving
on moving shadows
october woods at dusk

freight train
towards the sunset
cows staring at cows

first falling leaves
vine tendrils sway too far from
what they could grasp

autumn equinox
the half and half
expires

old books
arranged by color
autumn days

sunset
the enflamed leaves
of poison oak

if i could
start all over
pink lady slipper

our daughter's wedding
dusting the room
she dreamed in

hotel room fan
a curl of hair goes round
and round on the floor

silkworms
cocooned
in their small voices

finding time
for the earth to feel
my bare feet

june bride
the church filled
with second thoughts

close to the waterfall
the sound i become lost in

drifting petals
a monarch butterfly
completes my dream

moving clouds
children play
hide and seek

the span
of a summer's day
daddy-long-legs

the silence
i once longed for
swollen moon

spanish guitar
something in me
genuflects

mountain
the story
beyond it

snowflakes falling
my thoughts gradually
compact

deep winter
she peels a tangelo
slowly

older and thinner
i'm more in touch
with my skeleton

thanksgiving visit
everything but cookies
in the cookie jar

virgin snow
an old man's feet
tingle

from here
to not there
kitchen mouse

falling snow
her deep
husky whisper

mid july
two-bee harmony
in the lavender

everywhere
in the river
the footprints of fish

hidden pond
water striders
ride the last light

midnight hush
always the under-note
of insects

shucking corn
the noise i make
when no one's home

wheat equidistant
from each ocean

moonless night
only alligator eyes along
the marsh

night storm
again and again
falling into my dream

dingo call by dingo call
the terrain takes shape

just plain hot
the stolen grocery cart
left under an oak

shorter days
spiderlings set out
for their corners

in recovery
all day a fly
between panes

police get on the ground!
no snow
for us to make angels

below the sheen
of starlight on the pond
a food chain

far upriver
the villages
with nothing to sell

winter solstice
commuters stand still
on the escalators

red-tailed hawk
on a telephone pole
the prairie listens

silent on the war
my father points out
the winter stars

crows cawing
from one hollow's frost
to the next

last quarter moon
the scrape of a blade
on the whetstone

pre-dawn hush
the forest
still dripping

election day
children in the park
ride the seesaw

a path of acorns
jay calls ricochet
from tree to tree

thanksgiving
having our fill
of family

funeral procession
a scruffy brown dog
marking tombstones

indian summer gone
a hillside of chimneys
smoke in the rain

high beams
the backward glance
of a possum

the sound of rain
in a windowless room
deep autumn

first snowfall
mouse droppings
in my fur-lined boots

winter funeral
we face our mortality
in high heels on ice

snow flakes
on my scarf
turning into wool

winter moon
downstream a duck breaks
from the water

the tilt
of the red snow shovel
spring rain

spring solitude
now and then a twig
floats under my bridge

springtime
even the pigeons
nodding their heads

deep snow
sorting a split green pea
from the yellows

this passionless calm
afternoon sun on pastures
bright with snow-melt

first spring day
the mayfly steadies
for lift off

we have to talk
tight curls
of the fiddleheads

compline
bullfrogs mark
the hours

tea in painted cups
the morning wind carries
rose scent

it's all
i ever wanted
fireflies

wind shift
the canola field
smelling yellow

lightning bugs
here for a moment
my childhood

the dusks
when plums start to bruise
easily

heatwave
i see more
of my neighbors

white lilies
another piece of asia
taking root

dusk
an empty beer can
taps the dock

end of summer
a few spots left
on the fawn

the last bite
of a red-flamed peach
summer's end

the oars at rest
where i am
becomes clear

ongoing drought
the stillness
of the rope swing

meanwhile
gloved hands brush lily dust
from the hearse

the deeper voices
of neighborhood boys
high summer

heat shimmers
weeds in the bolt holes
of a lost hubcap

petals falling
from apology roses

goathead thorn
the pond drained
to its stones

hoot of a train
feet move around the stray dog
asleep on the platform

striking a match
against his boot
approaching storm

humid day
dog drool
down the window

mountain trickle
down in the valley
it gets a name

sparrows!
taking in the battlefield
in little hops

the holocaust
and morning coffee
bind two old friends

summer vacation
grandmother's stories stretch from
sunrise to sunset

the butterscotch scent
of ponderosa pine
a bluebird's soft calls

next to me in the park
feeding the ducks
the unknown soldier

tornado warning
the meteorologist
continues to smile

midday
the coffee turns
to wine

creek-side rope swing
learning the art
of letting go

dissolving
into the cool night air
the call of an owl

insomnia
the stillness of a moth
on my closet mirror

midsummer night
opening a window
into forever

afternoon breeze
the pace of paddle boats
in the park

fifth of july
bottle caps
stamped in the sand

historic battlefield
a young boy
straddles a cannon

take out window
i give my order to
a mouth and chin

longest day 
an ant circles
the sink drain

july 4th
the dog follows
her piccolo notes

little league mound
a whiff of his hero's
sunscreen

corn maze
at every turn
autumn quickens

twilight in the trees
just enough
to watch a falling leaf

unable to open
the door
she slammed

how long can i hold
my breath
autumn deepens

deepening autumn
the stumble comes as stumbles
seem to do

walking the rails
a whistle of wind
in my styrofoam cup

faintly
the sound of anklets
all night rain

stumping for votes
the sound of wind
on a microphone

smoketown dawn
a rogue rooster's
corrugated cry

old stone walls
the hands
that made them

new leaves
the nose wrinkle
of a baby's yawn

magnolias
a pathway long enough
to make them memorable

long line of clouds
my sister invents
ancestors

text message
downloading
the atlantic ocean

summer solstice
a garter snake's tongue
tastes the air

first light of day
a coot's wake
widens

the path opens
to a world of stars
and frogs

toting a cloud
of seagulls
harbor shuttle boat

cat's tongue
laps the atlantic
from my damp skin       

morning calm
rain drops all along
the grass blade

night of crickets
only my fingers
remember the password

this year
instead of bushfire
big dragonflies

early autumn
scraping the last of the mustard
from the jar

something new
in the repertoire
pileated woodpecker

autumn sun
she says no
to further chemo

focusing
first on the foghorns
and then on the lulls

back and forth
dragonflies
hawk the dusk

true north
the eucalyptus sheds
a length of bark

this is when
you said you'd call
cricket song

sudden gust
from out of the blue
the sound of leaves

backyard memorial
how the maple sapling
has grown this year

end of a pier
we talk to
our reflections

warm wind
the neighbor tosses back
the fallen apple

august dusk
a bit of blue bends
around the moon

diamond wedding
doing things for each other
we never dreamt of

husking corn
on a neighbor's porch
dusk creeps in

full moon rocking
my bobber
in the ripples  

patter of rain
the wind chimes
in silhouette  

moonlit sheets
the soft coming
of moths to the screen

today's list
of yesterday's tasks
cottonwood fluff

morning stroll
unshared thoughts float off
with the withered leaves

summer's end
tearing out the ivy
with both hands

tumbleweeds
stopped by a fence
the milky way

hot night
the moth fans a breeze
through the screen

sudden gust
the book opens to a poem
i like even better

approaching storm
the young blackbird struggles
with a worm

summer rain
cat draped
over the footstool

summer lethargy
between faucet drips
the ticking of the kitchen clock

sound of a bomber
wind is striking
the pulled-down blind

summer begins
the underground sprinkler head
raises a rock

downpour
all the puddles
wash away

this heat
only the shadows
move

dew drop
on a dusty grass blade
the ant backs up

dense foliage
the full strawberry moon
makes a path

at the edge
just as i let my hair down
the blue heron flies

changing frost patterns
on the windowpane
winter sun

leaving
she uncoils the morning glory
from the garden gate

distant lightning
followed by the sound
of a cricket

october moon
a waterstrider dimples
the gilded stream

boarded window
of the tarot reader
autumn evening

november wind
one leaf pauses
at each sidewalk crack

river rocks
turtles sunning
in tiers

alpine meadow
kneeling to photograph
white heather

scattered bones
the dog puts on the scent
of the dead

twilight
words in the margins
of sketchbook trees

one straw
longer than the others
fragrant bale

adrift
casting a bright line
into shadow

traffic wind
in the black-eyed susans
a dead bear

humid night
the depth of purple
in the shadows

swinging gate
rain fills
your footprints

a broader path
i rake away my footprints
with the yellow leaves

stained glass
the fleeting shadow
of a bird

steady rain
i fall short of being the human
i wish to be

wild iris
the water leaks
from a cracked vase

morning stillness
a dandelion seed
hovers

old broom
half swept away
with the dirt

a gust of wind
finally knocks the scarecrow out
cold

spring rain
a puddle at the end
of the hopscotch ladder

fluttering breeze
the moth sticks its legs
through a screen

cats sunning
i speak their names
their tails twitch

transient asleep
at the fountain's edge
coin-light on his cheek

a long line
at the drinking fountain
ants

clouds billow
the island bridge swings open
for one ship

sultry day
a lizard rides my finger
to the aloe leaf

oppressive heat
a bird emerges
from a puffy cloud

lingering day
a garbage can lid
becomes first base

summer breeze
the criss-cross of gull tracks
in damp sand

swamp sunset
the dragonfly rises
from a lily pad

summer morning
squeak
of the bicycle seat

chill wind 
the heart of an oak
leaves the chimney

appointment calendar
a coffee ring joins
one day to the next

heat lightning
the skull of a deer
in the tall grass

a cloud of dust
behind the tractor
harvest moon rising

evening shadows
white egrets fold
into their tree

barn for sale 
between the rafters
a wedge of moon

historic cabin
we nibble windfall apples
on the rotten porch

all souls’
a wasp returns
to the lintel

autumn dusk 
the hill gradually slopes
toward city din

scent of windfalls 
the whisper
of solitaire cards

old armchair
its weight
this autumn night

fall night heavens
the sound of our bath
draining

heat wave 
a spider pokes a leg
from a curled leaf

summer’s end
only dead grass
shows the circus was here

the horse fly
attracted to my ear
strike three

withering garden 
ladybugs neatly wrapped
in spider silk

moonlight
on a white cactus blossom
end of summer

heat
the smell of ozone
before a storm

litter
in the wildflowers
prisoners

day winding down
the pink flick
of a lizard’s tongue

summer drought 
deciding where
to cross the creek

summer moon 
her eyelashes touch
the telescope lens

garden path 
the same weeds
in their country

rain on the horizon
the inside of the nest
worn smooth

low tide
rain wets
the driftwood

peonies 
how earnestly we discuss
last night’s soap opera

cold tea
in the tea cup
no more to say

wisp of a cloud
in a vast blue sky 
my thoughts exactly

to the beat of rain
the builder darkens
with his wood

jellyfish dance
breathing in
with a perfect stranger

their love
now out in the open
night blooming jasmine

summer breeze
taking down the wind chimes
you left

at the funeral
his secret life
white chrysanthemum

memorial tablet
copper letters push up
through the snow

his christmas package
the icy steps
of the post office

frost
everywhere i look 
the milky way

town tree 
amongst the christmas lights
a crow’s nest

crescent moon
the smooth curves
of her headstone

shortest day
a sparrow chirps
in the dark

nutcracker suite 
a star falls from
the ballerina’s hair

cold night
the dashboard lights
of another car

as i wait for you
the light of venus
through falling leaves

college photos
out of the shoe box
a dry apple core

fall leaves
he tells me
i’ve changed

autumn sun
i follow the shadow
with the limp

approaching winter
the fragrance of herbs
under sweet straw

autumn mist
the honey locust
holding light

sweet grapes
the conversation passes
between friends

shortening flames
from the blacksmith’s coals
autumn sun

autumn’s scent
in the pile of leaves
i take the dare

bumper crop
the pecan tree’s shadow
stippled in shells

late night 
a waitress repeats
the list of pies

falling leaves
we both speak
of living wills

watching the waves
a stray dog settles
beside me

winter stars
i learn to paint
empty spaces

cold morning
the soap bar
razor thin

snow day
finding my first grade class
in a drawer

new year’s eve 
sending prayer slips
with the ebb tide

winter dusk
a grandchild draws
my weary smile

walking the dogs
over the snowy fields 
orion

first snow 
against my will
the beauty

leaf-fall
for a moment
the cat all kitten

summer’s end
loose-leaf notebook snaps
echo in the hall

crisp blue sky
the fir tip
rests a crow

spawning salmon 
a bubble rises between
the river stones

nameless stream
i vaguely remember
my father’s face

autumn wind
the sidelong glance
from a goose

early autumn park
the perfect circles
of a little girl

autumn walk
needles at the bottom
of the stream

autumn breeze
a pine cone waddles
toward the shore

windrows
the undulating whistle
of pigeon wings

indian summer 
a squirrel tips over
the bag of rock salt

winter evening
a light is burning
in the back of the house

winter doldrums
my landlady enumerates
the perennials

winter silence
another armload
of junk mail

spring rain
the crumpled obituary
by my bed

mausoleum 
just passing
through

from the teahouse
the smell of must
fallen cherry leaves

fallen leaves 
a line of snails
in the bark fold

swollen stream 
my friend talks about
the cancer

rain and wind 
in the circle of mourners
one person smiling

monday morning
ant on the coffee cup
going in circles

country town
a railway station
without tracks

red-throated finch song
a hint of it in beethoven’s
rhythm and angles

no old habits 
the newborn’s
cry

evening rain 
the screen door
covered with moths

bay shallows
a starfish moves its fingers
over mine

for the second time
the mourning dove feeding
without her mate

spring dawn
one at a time
the newborn’s eyes open

white handkerchief 
my mother shoos
a cabbage moth

opening the window
after lovemaking
the earth’s fragrance

beached kelp 
we examine each other’s
life lines

rainy morning 
the old beggar not there
outside the tea shop

playground
searching the hubbub
for one voice

summer night
the strawberry stain
on a popsicle stick

wild roses 
the iron trellis
tilts to one side

origami
we fold the map into
a vacation

cool morning 
the smell of garlic bread
reaches the street boy

tongue out
the boy guides a new airplane
round and round

bright morning
the smell of geraniums
on my fingers

looking up
rules of punctuation 
the green hills

love-in-the-mist 
a persian carpet
worn to warp threads

a rainbow
horizon to horizon
the curved wings of gulls

tomorrow i leave
cones high
in the old pine

spring morning
a chained dog
settles in the dust

country road
no way home
without a detour

summer rain
the back yard hole filled
with tricycles

creek mouth
bathing the dog
in sunset

the ride
past the roadside fruit stand
spring solitude

late spring
lambs play
in the slaughteryard

commute 
carpooling with
the same fly

first rain
the smell as dust
changes to mud

still a few leaves 
dog hair
painted into the wall

first snowflakes
a cat whisker
in my hand

snowman
one less carrot
in the pot

cold morning
the old horse gets up
and goes to work

winter light
flour sugar and the canister
that held dog biscuits

deep winter
not knowing for certain
where the garden is

bare branch ridged with snow
a chickadee
powders my face

river sand
paw prints catch
the morning rain

the jingle
of the dog's tags
wild currant in bloom

old burial mound
here lies
a red plastic spade

the prayer
i don't recall
mourning doves

father's day
the one who won't
stay buried

the urge to yawn
in this fly-infested loo
long day

battleground museum
cavalry uniforms
smaller than imagined

heat lightning
rabbits dart
in all directions

breaking light
i translate my thoughts
from birdsong

patio brunch
chickadee doo dah
chickadee day

sultry day
a fly resting
on the swat

dry creek
between rocks the flow
of fire ants

heat dome
a tiny lizard
riffles the dune

box canyon
the late-day heat
in my bones

we walk a silent path
towards the coolness
of bluebells

blue wildflowers
the map that won't
refold

moonshot
a sandcastle falls
to the morning tide

swallows
so many ways
to come home

morning dew
her smile
follows me home

full of rain
a lotus bud cracks open
spilling sunlight

jasmine
a grandmother
in every floret

my new mule
settles into a trot
the spring day

one by one
into their stalls
horseflies

salt laced clay
the delicacy
of an eland's hoof

secret wedding
a bee in a tulip
in a bouquet

close the window
slowly
summer's soft air

almost dawn
reed warbler's song
in her dreams

first day of spring
the squeaking of
new shoes

narrow road
i give way
to the wind

stone lantern
a gust of pear blossoms
slowly settles

ancient willow
all i know
of the wind

a monkey
picking lice off its child
evening downpour

chewing the cud
highland cattle
melt into mist

unfurling oak leaves
a burst of birdsong brings out
the binoculars

glass tumbler
sunlight haloes
each willow catkin

she gives me some
to take the sickness away
soap bubbles

getting to the root
of our differences
dandelions

winter into spring
peeling the paper off
a muffin

snowmelt
fluttering tail
of a bronze horse

seventy springs
the time it takes
to know the river

long rains
the mound that is father's grave
leveling with mum's

spring predawn
the janitor sweeps
the night away

she mixes red yellow blue
to make mud
spring rain

untidy busker
his guitar
in perfect pitch

quiet rain
knowing each other's
rain habits

leaving divorce court
a blossom
beneath her shoe

easter migraine
the hollow chocolate bunny
inside me

waking up early
i listen to the forest
waking up

beachcombing
she finds a pebble
worth keeping

hindu temple
the stone mason's hands
fashion a princess

each mindful crease
of the origami crane
august morning

skinny dip
the taste of salt
on her earlobe

washing machine
our unmentionables
mingle

dog days
squeaks from the sprinkler
become squeals

a piercing cry
noh theater actors
become their masks

weak battery
the sound of the surf
in my hearing aid

mild breeze
the scent of summer
neatly stacked in hay bales

wind in the grass
all the world
turned hawk

daily walk
the strangers i know
by their dog's name

day moon
the child notices
her first freckle

no common name
for this autumn hoverfly
colors in the wind

sweater burs
in larger clumps
autumn deepens

evolution
of a lie told well
potato peel pie

late autumn
a part of the darkness
swoops down

finger puppets
my daughter asks me
what's a soul

clearcut
a disk of snow
on every stump

christmas eve
he comes out
as an atheist

new year's eve
the mildewed box
of noisemakers

after all is
said and done
winter

sun on snow
dark tree shadows
from middle-earth

winter wind
before her answer
the breath she takes

slow mallard steps
in the frozen harbor
a clanging halyard

winter stillness
the dog gets up
to go lie down

ginger tea
the glow of embers
in the wood stove

snow thumping
from the trees
valentine's day

our eyes
touch and linger
hawk on a wire

winter road
long coats
walking

ocean of stars
the ancient humpback
going home

home town
my struggle to be
who i was

labor day
the indolence
of flags

second wind
a sustained ovation
of aspens

for our gazing
the moon
full enough

what still might happen
windfall apples

old family recipe
hoping our hands
are the same size

preparing a feast
grandma's breasts
sweat

winding road
the home she never
talks about

moonset
something scampers
off the roof

a branch
dangles from the cedar
my friend's last days

at the meadow's edge
the turn
of the doe's ear

stubbled fields
gunshots fill the sky
with geese

the dog's arthritis
catches up to mine
our shorter walks

muddling spices
with mortar and pestle
the sound of rain

filling a billy
from the cowshed vat
buttermilk sky

train whistle
the color of dusk
before it snows

snow angel
the sound
of your whisper

first snow
everyone else forgets
how to drive

back to normalcy
the christmas tree
put out

mouse tracks
to the edge of the river
morning stars

tree branches empty
a lone bird
changes everything

lighting a candle
with a candle
another night of snow

squaring up
already square quilt blocks
second day of snow

choir practice
winter sunlight touches
the unstained window

childhood home
the darkness of the floor
where the bed was

midnight shift
the lingering scent
of feral cats

late snow
a sun pattern
through bike spokes

river mist
the stillness
of cygnets

sunrise
who said i couldn't
walk on clouds

virgin forest
huge firs lift
the dawn

bulrushes
we lean into the songs
of blackbirds

damp woods
the old dog's nose taps
behind my knee

no talk of 'nam
always a hitch in his
shadow

full moon
she stirs a shadow
in her coffee cup

hummingbird wings
waiting for the world
to pause

after the winds
trees
and other litter

the song
of a windy bottle
i empty my mind

falling leaves
a bird enters the house
in the cat's mouth

raking leaves
the little girl next door
hands me a red one

migrating whales
all our footprints
wash away

not here long
the child asks to see
a star fall

baiting one fish
with another
autumn dawn

the ocean
a shallow stream merging
without sound

gloomy morning
a worm follows an oil slick
down the gutter

foghorn
the slow roll of a fish
on the line

morning frost
stutter
of the rooster

mourning
a piece of birchbark
peels

gulls far off
in the twilight calm
lock waters fall

a skipping stone
strikes the moored sailboat
autumn drizzle

talk of war
my toddler points at swells
before they break

cold mountain shadow
the slow drip of a spring
into sunlight

the first flakes of snow
drifting down on the wetlands
canada geese

late from break
the dash through bees and clover
in heels

sunday morning
ants on the rim of my
coffee cup

heat lightning
the heron's toes
grip dead wood

park twilight
a light comes on
by itself

the fog lifts
ripened tomatoes
weight the trellis

first brushstrokes
texture the white gesso
daybreak

the wildflowers
that shook the day piled
in baskets

dull afternoon
waterdrops slide
into waterdrops

tangled seaweed
two raccoons tussle
over a clam

ocean calm
the huge red sun touches
its reflection

first autumn rain
under firs summer lingers
in scented dust

white lilies
the parish priest
begins to speak

autumn foliage
some old friends
remarry

pink morning light
a dying monarch struggles
from cupped hands

autumn vacation
clouds in the blue sky
unmapped and nameless

just a tinge
of red in the leaves
evening crickets

no name on her plot
i move the flowers about
bare grave to bare grave

white sand raked smooth
one persimmon
one dent

cold sky
a trolley headlight
cresting the hill

cold morning rain
a poor man takes a doll
from the trash bin

snowmelt
in the stump's hollow
a sparrow bathes

concrete carport
a swallow fledgling peeks
from its mud nest

across the street
a gust of wind glistens
with gingko leaves

bitter wind
a withered hops vine
curled around the trellis

gathering winter violets
a helicopter shadow
stops my hands

night rain
the small serrated song
of a frog

over the top
of my sunglasses
blue sky

christmas eve
the monk's frosted window
kindles a star

low clouds
orion's feet
disappear

clouds of a cold front
the star i'd been wishing on
winks out

leather gloves
in the rafters a barn owl
closes its eyes

white cat
moving her black kitten
moonlit snow

dark woods
an owl glides out
into moonlight

dirt road
coyote skins draped over
a snowy fence

winter rain
tied to the gate
a yellow balloon

winter night
my cat
kneads me

september morning
again my breath rises
to an open sky

approaching gale
the beach grass sweeps circles
deeper in the dune

after the hurricane
most of the moon
gone

night of stars
the rhythm of my boat
across the swells

yellow moon
the smell of woodsmoke
on the wind

that glittering point
in the distant evergreen
a dewdrop

hurricane path
a layer of green covers
early autumn leaves

such sharp edges
the few red leaves on a branch
of eucalyptus

collected fog
the raveled fringe
of her scarf

yellow raincoats
farm workers picking
the last of the peppers

cherry tomato
the scent from its leaves lingers
on my fingertips

thistledown
my thoughts carry me
back to sea

noon
sunflowers sway
with goldfinches

lunch break
a blue dragonfly lights
on the sawhorse

sultry evening
a peacock´s plaintive cry
across the flooded field

yellow jasmine
arriving chickadees
shake out perfume

overcast morning
the last of the tomatoes
line the windowsill

closing time
zoo animals smaller
than their shadows

outer space
limbs of the bare oak reach
the farthest stars

blue morning light
at the writing desk
the rain falls harder

where nobody cares
growing with green vigor
the sumac

one limb at a time
the falcon calls her fledglings
nearer to flight

knocked off by rain
camellias bloom again
in the puddles

horse trough
a cowboy chips away
the winter

the bell rings
again the playground fills
with pigeons

cliff trail
a raven´s broad shadow sweeps
the greening valley

bumbled by a bee
rugosa rose petals fall
through the breathless air

dressed for church
the perfume
of the garden

in the parking lot
a rose petal has arrived
from nowhere special

slightly warm
this one perfectly ripe
wild blackberry

twilight beach
a wave takes half
the lovers´ heart

summer night
after the fireworks
the smoke

long sermon
in the roof beams
cobwebs flutter

between thumb and forefinger
a raspberry
full of morning sun

the salad bar´s
long metal tongs
dining hall coolness

first thunderclap
our neighbor stops
hammering

indian summer
the ground-fall pear
warm in my hand

all saints' day
surviving pumpkins
covered in frost

ink long faded
from the wooden grave marker
fog rolling in

drifting gingko leaves
all of my yellow pencils
worn down to nubs

on withered boughs
faint shimmers of light
the pale ringed moon

the sound of rakes
in a neighbor's yard
fingernail moon

autumn breeze
evergreen's lowest branches
brush fallen needles

a bell moves
in the fog
the tops of cows

autumn chill
the garden hose ends
in a puddle of ice

cloudless day
the hollow sound of the
woodpecker's knocking

autumn sunlight
beads of holy water arc
toward the casket

sunset
glowing clouds
fade on the river

night fills in slowly
between the dark branches
autumn equinox

desert night
beyond the silence
heat lightning

new milkweed pods
one tie goes up and down
under the freight train

a great blue heron
wading through autumn colors
one step at a time

stillness
in the lava bed
a hawk's shadow

evening
our paddles drip
into liquid sunset

the garden by moonlight
only jasmine
and white roses

kudzu creeps
through the shack's roof
steady rain

early cranberries
the workers' hats
bob up and down

stopped
on the iron fence
dove feather

patterns on the lake
the moment before
they become trees

empty well
the bucket filled
with rainwater

slave cabin
hidden by acres and acres
of sugarcane

it lifts its head
the woolly bear caterpillar
in autumn wind

november night
with the sound of pelting rain
the barking dog

no sign
where two roads meet
iris blooms

offshore birds
a flock swerves and vanishes
in the glitter of waves

beach of shells
a fisherman casts
into the sunset

dark waters crest
tied to an old oak
a wooden casket

that four o'clock bird
strangers
we share the dawn

cloverleaf exit
a swell of swallows
in twilight

sunset
the butterfly and i
just in time

last sunbeam
on the mossy boulder
crickets chirping

a leaf falls
from the greenhouse ficus
clap of thunder

early morning fog
waving good-bye
to a school bus

cold drizzle
black birds pace
the asphalt roof

taste of sunshine
on a yellow pear
one raindrop

how still i am
waiting for the storm
how still the bamboo

humid summer night
the small town casts a glow
on slow-moving clouds

coffee brewing
the swish swish swish of tires
through autumn drizzle

not a laughing mouth
a bent bow or an eyelash
the slender new moon

ashes to ashes
clinging to the fingers
yellowish clay

baby's giggle
the way a laugh changes
two faces

soft breeze
the rhythm of wind chimes
and northern lights

earthquake
the lingering scent
of jimson weed

shady sidewalk
an acorn lands
in a hopscotch square

a moment
near the woodcarver's hands
hummingbird

moonlit camellias
cafè conversations spilling
into the street

stillness
of the lava bed
a hawk's shadow

october stroll
the shadow of mom's cane bends
over cobblestones

a quiet street
bright yellow leaves settle on
an empty bench

dusk
the tamarack's yellow needles
scattered in the grass

revolving door
a gust of holiday laughter
warms the sidewalk

thanksgiving pie
the first long curl falls
from grandma's apple peeler

our teen out late
through his window
orion

wind funnel
whirling leaves across the drive
my neighbor waves her rake

recycling box
back inside
with leaves

small town market
the clerk chooses coins
from an older man's palm

december 19
rows and rows of mailboxes
with their red flags up

carefully unwrapped
the favorite ornament
lying in pieces

a moth
has extinguished the icon lamp
shining stars

breath rising
the church steeple bathed
in moonlight

chained dog
its white breaths lengthening
in the wind

white winter light
deep among pines
the mule deer doze

snow flurries
candlelight moving
from window to window

christmas eve
listening to the snow
fall

outstretched necks
a pair of tundra swans
running on the lake

quiet so deep
you can hear the swan
crook its neck

feather beds airing
on a balcony
cumulus clouds

summer dusk
the babel of mynahs
in a banyan

the long segments
of the big dipper's handle
summer fields

haying
swallows widen
the summer sky

dry season
the infant in the stroller
sucks his toes

heat lightning
a siren
nearer and nearer

summer evening
the scent of fresh loaves
as i pass the bakery

first locust
a breeze curls across
the ripe wheat

the farmer's spit
catches on a thistle
still no rain

embroidered dresses
showcased in the window
eyebrow moon

after a swim
the rock's warmth
soaring gull

the longest day
my lip print fades
from her sunburn

a firefly
on my open palm
its moonshadow

kahlo exhibit
the guard's face half lit
between two portraits

summer camp
studying other people's
collections of stones

ducks paddling
slowly upriver
open drawbridge

open air theatre
above oberon and puck
two bats looping

santa fe rain
red chili strings shine
by the porch light

late summer drizzle
evening walkers
slow their pace

perseids
a bat flits
across the yard

end of summer
the bumper car glides
to a stop

cool dusk
kookaburra chatter
from a tree's silhouette

insomnia
the cat's breathing
deepens

heavy fog
among river rocks
a single poppy

the gardener's truck
willow leaves scattering
down miles of highway

end of summer
the changing sound
of maple leaves

first night alone
finally the moon
reaches the western windows

foggy morning
through the open window
a blur of birdsong

morning dew
darkness of footprints
off the path

wintering field
cranes as one
face the coyote

graffiti wall
the rain uncovers
a poem

mountain sunrise
the silhouette
of distant firs

stopping here
while all around us moves
wind in the mist

father's silhouette
at the pier's end
departing geese

west-bound train
the winter sunset
lasts a while

chilly dawn
rain-bent briars
block the trail

spring mist
a mallard paddles
through our stillborn's ashes

evening haze
geese come up from the pond
in two's and three's

a change in their voices
children finding
a fledgling

snowy night
sometimes you can't be
quiet enough

new home
our footsteps find the grass
beneath the snow

late summer
the sound of the stream
running dry

dawn
caught in a dewdrop
the empty swing

death valley
a tumbleweed
faintly green

sunrise clouds
a rat burrows
into earthquake rubble

barefoot
in the dandelions
warm rain

morning tea
a warbler's song drifts
through a wind chime

las vegas
all the lights fading
into sunrise

desert wind
the potter's fingerprints
impressed on an ancient urn

washing day
wind whips the judo jacket
through its moves

labyrinth path
a change in the wind
with each turn

ripening kale
a white cabbage moth
lands again and again

daybreak
a white dog
crosses the snow

winter sunset
a taxi cab
stops in front of me

the road home
a star too bright
to be a star

meltwater
a trout leaps
the falls

iris garden
the golden spider's
giant egg case

empty birdfeeder
the shimmer of falling snow
as a sparrow lands

winter dusk
she paints her nails
deeper red

roar of snowmelt
beneath the footbridge
first dogwood blossom

birdsong
the shimmer of rain
on the lake

a child's smile
ringed with dirt
spring planting

japanese garden
a bamboo staff left
in the bamboo

this house
is my last home
bougainvilleas in bloom

the flatness
of watermelon seeds
august dusk

peony bud
cut for the grave
wren song all day long

mole crabs
in the palms of my hands
the retreating surf

moving day
their pregnant cat
left behind

midday heat
snap of the shoeshiner's rag
against the toe

the waiting room
an ant on my lapel
cleans its antennae

afternoon warmth
the reflections of horse heads
in muddy trough water

dark blues
the empty halves
of a sea shell

autumn sun
a fly captured
in amber

train berth
hot tea from a clay pot
tasting of earth

morning moonlight
a raccoon teeters
on the chain link fence

sand speckled
by autumn rain
her hand in mine

indian summer
the doe turns
into the wind

autumn wind
my arms around the child
within

dawn
a lorry driver washes
his face by the highway

gray sky
smelling the air for rain
or smoke

desert petroglyph
autumn rain falls
on the sun

autumn drizzle
i chop the carrots
into finer bits

last berries
the weight of a squirrel
on the branch end

dead tree
the last leaf
chirps

alpine air
losing the few stars i know
to the skyful

the jaw ache
from a temporary crown
winter rain

winter sun
the blur of stones
beneath river ice

morning frost
broken venetian blinds
in the house of the murder

hope
without knowing what for
autumn colors

winter sunrise
the random tilt
of beaver-chewed trees

rugby scrum
a cloud of breath
floats above

evening visitation
the smell of winter
on coats

spring morning
the raven goes
where the wind went

small town 
the smell of
everyone's wood

ground hog day
arthritis loosens its grip
on my thumb

freshly washed hair
scent of the wind
rushing past

new to the islands
she sniffs
the hibiscus

war jitters
brush-stroked hollyhocks
stand at attention

so many stars
through the pruned grapevine
the buzz of mosquitoes

dawn
i come face to face
with a mountain

maple shade 
young girls follow their recipe
for mud pies

open drawbridge 
counting the masts
of ships unseen

twilit path
a tarantula
lifts a leg

first light
i pretend to shave
my son's lathered face

monday morning 
a flaw in the shadow
of the sugarbowl

dwindling light
my childhood home
a parking lot

retirement options
first ice
rims the campus pond

sunset on ice
my slow shadow
by giacometti

winter windstorm
a tea kettle whistles
on the woodstove

frozen sky 
the star over home
bigger than the others

my father's globe
so many countries
with wrong names

one last look
through the old apartment
a dry sponge

musical over 
the chill an exit door
lets in

winter evening
neither of us bothers
to remove the tea bags

crackling frost 
fox kits tumble
in the moonlight

spring clouds
piled all over the mountains 
new puppies sleep

headstone
a dash
between the years

the lingering sound
of a bell
sun on old wood

alone
with my cheerios
and another missing child

misty window 
a child draws the rain
with slashing lines

fast freight 
a yellow dandelion
between blue rails

burial ground 
offshore kelp billowing
with the tide

despite
my forgetfulness
pink geraniums

birthday morning
the moth on the mirror
in a different place

gray morning
the shire horse's fetlocks
caked with mud

snow on thin ice
skid marks
where the hare turned

winter night 
the understanding eyes
of a lumpy teddy

new year's day
the cat leaves a hairball
on the bed

false spring 
the wavering reflection
of a broken branch

ship horns
footprints crisscross
the misty beach

trial separation
ice distends
the rain gutters

winter rain 
a long trail of ants
to the honey jar

winter rain 
i search for ways
to be four again

the word father
in tatsuko’s haiku scroll 
winter camellias

spring scents
my dog and i walk
through different worlds

upcurls of morning fog
the waterfall's lather
on boulder moss

walking for my health 
the mutter of ducks
beneath the pier

autumn afternoon 
a tramp warms his back
against a headstone

fluttering
at the edge of the farm
surveyor’s flags

a distant tractor
long into the evening
curlews

ripe blueberries
the morning mist
knee high

parrot or fruit bat?
examining the shape
of the apple core

sunset
the shimmer
of dragonfly wings

pickup truck
an old retriever
laps the wind

a sheep dying
in dirty straw
its blond eyelashes

sunlight
through a snail shell
and the snail

i turn the radio lower
and lower
the summer stars

no wind today
the cottonwoods speak
in chickadee

spring again
a taste of rust
in the harmonica

spring morning
the freshly painted name
on the overpass

a fallen leaf
rocks back and forth 
the size of an ant

tidal creek
slowing my pulse
the blue heron’s flight

funeral day
a black ribbon binds
the wind chimes

goldfinch
on the topmost birch branch
sunrise

manhattan skyline 
i gather egg-shaped stones
by the river

day laborers
gathered at the goodwill 
the dripping awning

coastal flatland
umbrellas color
a cemetery

dad’s tie
slips from my neck 
bearded iris

summer lightning
at the crack of dawn
the temple conch

mare’s tail clouds 
great aunt pointing out
where stores used to be

high desert sun
the field of poppies
shining back

afternoon tea
wind chimes mingle
with the river’s sound

sultry night
the breeze from a fan
stirs up the gossip

kudzu greening
the iron gate posts 
a buck’s velvet antlers

summer pasture
a calf licks dew
from the cattle gate

midday heat
the sheen of fish scales
on the pier

last color
left in the sky
a flicker’s call

aftershock
the music box takes up
where it left off

deadfall pine
the beetle does
a head stand

sleeping bag 
the distance between me
and the nearest star

oak leaves
curled almost shut
the clocks turned back

frost on the windows
the crescent moon’s
sharp points

blue frost
a man on the train
with too much to carry

summer night
the soft bottom
of a farm pond

sunday morning 
nothing comes or goes
but the fog

corn stubble
rippling ribbons
of blackbirds

hurricane alert
a sudden urge to visit
his grave

falling leaves
the street preacher
quickens his cadence

snow warning
the bend in the hemlock
furrows her brow

new year’s eve
looking for my sign
among the stars

spilled milk 
nothing more
pours out

rain all day 
behind the bead curtain
her smile

february storm
my ratty blue volvo
under plum petals

first snow
today i’ll wash
the dishes by hand

a puff of fog
floats over the falls
new year’s dawn

winter seclusion
we cover the fridge
with children’s drawings

valentine’s day 
a cyclist signals
with a long-stem rose

rainy day
my mother singing
an old love song

millet seeds
sticking to the cardinal’s beak 
winter rain

garden sundial
from nine to noon
leftover snow

graveside kaddish
the weight of the stone
in my hand

sea cliff
fledgling gannets
face the wind

widow’s cottage 
rosemary edges closer
to the door

almost spring
humming the notes
of a bird’s song

april burial
the weeping mother neatens
her son’s perfect hair

her first fossil
the curve of the creek
in springtime

spring rain
a bruise on my arm
from donating blood

morning mist 
a bridge spanning
an invisible lake

winter nears
in the dog's eyes
the wolf

the big dipper
turned up
stubble fields

september sun
a bubble wavers
between salmon bones

gold leaves
swirl around the maple
thanksgiving alone

possible remission
bitter wind
shivers the shutters

his silence
the sounds of rain
becoming hail

pulsing light
the crunch of leaves
as the ambulance pulls away

first snow
in each school window
a face

scent of winter
the sycamore's tire swing
turns in the wind

sounds of a downpour
i trace the pillow pattern
on her cheek

stormy night
hot jelly roll
from the jukebox

morning frost
a compost seedling
sparkles

clear marsh sky
the sound of geese
drinking water

angry voices
the child purrs
to his kitten

sparrow's song
the ancient piling
of a lake-dweller site

grassy hill
a suitcase of dolls
let out to stretch

a child's shoe
left on the wooden bridge
late spring

river fog
the slow creaking
of an anchor line

alone at sunrise
a small wave covers
my shadow

soft morning rain
the island deer stretches
for a golden plum

late-day silence
the backs of cattle
steaming after rain

covered bridge
the sound of the river
between planks

willow scent
a kingfisher hangs
in the air

autumn evening
a hedgehog scurries
over cobblestones

twilight lingers
from the wrecking yard
flash of a blowtorch

coming home
on the train
the backyards

crisp air
the sound of an ax
across the lake

autumn afternoon
the bride leans
into the wind

autumn mist
the parking meter
in a black plastic bag

down the train's long aisle
everyone else asleep
prairie flatness

a skimming stone
makes the mountains wobble
autumn chill

first frost
on the window ledge
the tea kettle's whistle

harvest moon
the groom inhales helium
from a white balloon

sharp moon
the sound of a cow
chewing dry leaves

fireplace ash
a mouse's journey
from here to there

tractor sounds
mare and foal
touch noses

a bicycle
left in the meadow
long shadows

twilight blossoms
the robin's song moves
from tree to tree

zen garden
snow melts
in raked patterns

dawn
amid bird calls
the sound of a broom

7th floor cubicle 9
a butterfly drifts
past the window

last light
a hot air balloon
dips into the canyon

twilight lingers
a coyote's shadow slips
across the neighbor's yard

haloed sun
the slight whispering
of tall corn

heat lightning
a tangled string
the cat left behind

caskets adrift
in the flooded cemetery
a crow alights

midnight
the window fan dices
a train whistle

after her death
finding the old scar
in my eyebrow

summer solstice
above the piazza del duomo
sun through a dove's wings

a cicada's long cry
pollen drifts through
twilight woods

a snakeskin
tacked to the drying board
midsummer's eve

her hum
the shapes never changing back
in the kaleidoscope

autumn mist
a complete
fairy ring

bikers laying wreaths
on soldiers' graves
first snow

the dog just
rolls with it

lamplit dust
an ant's path
across the psalms

blizzard
another trip
to the game closet

balloon animals
the kids tether them
to my wrists

in the bakery windows
sunlit challah

his memorial
more than my share
of cherry pie

no one's footsteps
left to follow
late winter rain

outdoor market
i linger in the shade
with sea cucumbers

near evening
willow shadows return
to the river

his dog asleep
on the empty side
third deployment

shimmering heat
two rams spark horns
at the water trough

opium poppies
droop with yellow dust
wind from the gobi

searing heat
the glint of a plow blade
surfacing from the soil

barber shop
only one fish left
in the aquarium

sun's embers
the rust-fangled workings
of the old mine

high country
pairs of kangaroo ears
pin down the sky

telephone poles
the long straight road
through clearcut

new white shirt
the outline
of my sunburn

they stomp off
flip-flops
having a dialogue

deep night
a dog sniffs
the moonlit toad

one of us
from a strange world
dragonfly

a small cabin
the moon
gets into everything

the things i think
i can't do without
lunar eclipse

birthday
a gathering of moths
on my paisley shawl

labor day
the sixth grader's
worry lines

unafraid
of what comes next
cicada shells

super moon
the pencil
pointless

silence
the monarchs
i remember

rain at dusk
the slanted scent
of baking apples

third day of rain
the sofa out of place
an inch

even on calm days
these coastal trees remember
which winds prevail

leaning into
an achilles stretch
autumn deepens

scent of the hills
when all you can see
are their outlines

starlight or hoarfrost
which magic to believe?

all but two
close their eyes
evening prayer

emergency room
pieces of autumn leaves
litter the floor

first snow
my children shed
20 years

on newly fallen snow

that instant
before the snowflake melts

of the rockinghorse

in the dark he compliments
my retinas

something

from themselves

at the root
of all the
nothingness

a fingerprint
on a fingerprint

on my son's face

on my wool shirt

in the autumn sun

the slosh
of a paddle wheeler

the slicked-down reeds
of a muskrat slide

orange sun
an eagle's talon
drips river

leaves floating
where others sank

darkness
beyond the porch light
the chatter of coyotes

wind's kickin' up
i make small talk
with the locals

a house martin lingers
above the bog

the hounds
at the end of their tethers
hunters' moon

fresh azure sky
the lark
ascending

sine wave
a purple finch
does the math

cooling shade

of the honeysuckle

mimosa flowers
drifting in the breeze
not wanting my book to end

the little shift
in the blue jay's song
accepting my age

self portrait
the summer dress
i wore out

ancient songs
an elder's sweat
rolls off the bone-flute

just a hint of the bullhead
in the blackness

where the grasshopper was
my vow of silence

impaled on osprey talons
the soft blue sky

a line of surfers waits
for the next wave

storm clouds building
re-enactors gather
for an understood outcome

just what i mean

of river stones
model home

flowers that fell
from wedding bouquets

from the lip of a lily
a grasshopper leaps
into summer

the church bell deepens
within me

nodding to
the rhythm of the breeze
wild lantanas

caterpillar
winding up the thread
of summer

wild flower
i breathe my
loneliness

the salted mist

rainy season
time slows down
on a banana slug trail

stringing memories
now i fly the kite
for father

a baby boy talks to his brother
in his own language

for as long
as i can remember
soap bubbles

shifting mist
a rocky outcrop
of wallabies

tristesse
a robin's egg
on cobble stones

rain beads
the scent of her
absence

with each pull of oar
tadpoles scatter
from the lily pads

in the two inches provided
the car-bound dog
sniffs the world

adopted
she wonders where
the waves come from

the last star
in the morning light
night-blooming cereus

a crow perches
on the sundial's gnomon
thunderclouds

dark corners
of a beet field
the pelting rain

he clings to the memory
of his old fallen barn
wild cucumber

long summer
the whiskey glass full
of midnights

we walk the path
that others made
dune grass

first tuft
of milkweed fluff
a wish for more summer

end of summer
the sparrows' songs
all vespers

making its way
around the sundial
moon shadow

am a leaf

as always

one shade lighter
than the wind

the woodchuck's cheek
full of flowers

decides to stay

coil in the sunshine

window-bumping

trumpet lily
more baroque
than jazz

the nonagenarian's
crisp salute

at the window
he pats the lettuce dry

in a hoarder's garage

by the fire

at the risk
of a relapse

not enough sun
to move the snake

tracking
the scent of fox
follows me

of the raccoon clan
spring constellations

a child opens his
face to the rain

of a basketball

the garden weeds
touch the scarecrow

on a hayroll

of young eels
the moon in their eyes

her red sweater
comes and goes

snow resifted
through hemlocks

over a floe

in the pantry

lagging behind

in moist sand

at the bend

in a boombox

a worn path between
the dead

stretches its shadow

in the storm's eye
stars

on the anthurium

puddle
just for a moment
the moon at rest

the ashes
still log-shaped
her 21st birthday

one tile missing
from the blue roof

meditation

the koi pond

moon sliver
the sound of dew
dropping from leaves

morning rain
blue flames flicker
under the teapot

looking in
my empty wallet again

march moon
the melted snow
begins to freeze

spring wind
even the skunk
smells fine

blossoms in the wind
my daughter's date
idles in the drive

easter vigil
into our kneeling silence
the creak of wood

no destination
for my evening walk
the hazy moon

april fool's day
a skylark's song
way over my head

beekeeper's gift
on the doorstep

lemon blossoms
by an open window
sunday bells

the baby's heart beats
against mine

summer evening
a boat returns to harbor
with pink sails

opened door
the darkness lengthens
into a kitten

from the balcony above
a hand outstretched
rain

touches the city

the play of sunlight
on my eyelids

stretch their wings

along the river

the sermon

before we count
one one-thousand

with moonlight

cicada stuck
in the pine tree's resin
still it sings

aging in place
a favorite bench
where the sun stays longest

first day of school
pinecone clusters
in the top branches

change of season
changing the way i hold
an umbrella

ashes scattered
beyond the floating pollen
white gloves grip the oars

the way back
so much further
without her

you always find
the grass in my hair
spring stars

i used to kneel
to water it
great oak

a crayon heart
in my suitcase

the stars also
wandering

at both ends
of the day

of a breaking branch

or three

in and out
of the confessional

by the jukebox

in the bluebird box

to catch what's left

when i skip a page

again meets

to the cellar

in the dryer

the shadow of the flame
turns with the wind

fine morning mist
she promises
to forget

yellow tulips
what if i don't want
to just be friends?

the tour guide
flounces her skirt

mating call
the koel tries
a different pitch

tumbling
from the nest
a fish eye

in the sawdust

to my dreams

with the hawk's silence

to the moon

the bright and dark sides
of stories

hand on my shoulder
he navigates me
through the milky way

on a clothesline
between stars
worn out jeans

night bus home
the idle counterweights
of cranes

he loves me
but loves her more
phases of the moon

chrysanthemums
my shadow
in the picture

half asleep
moonlight seeps
into my veins

losing my way
the x-shaped tracks
of a roadrunner

a sheep's skull
in the rusty wheelbarrow
abandoned goldfield

counting tree rings
i tell my son
about his grandfather

driftwood
she counts his dalliances
with both hands

horses gathered
around the haystack
setting sun

flying termites
the maid switches off the lamp
and lets moonbeams in

autumn woods
is it only
the wind?

the gentle give
of the pine needle path
autumn solitude

a boy squeezes
his box of raisins

out a train window
the clickety-clack
of a little town

a greeting card
from the one who got away
wind-blown leaves

a sphinx moth makes the most
of moonflowers

deep in my pocket
a wishing stone

the duckweed

high in trees

the boulder becomes
a wombat

its dive

under the floodlights

through first leaves

in the neo-natal ward

from my hoodie

all eyes
on the bagpiper's kilt

removing it
to sneeze

spring wind
she stands
on the pedals

tiger lily
knowing this
cannot be love

spring peepers
the ferris wheel lights
across the river

clear sky
the life of coins
in the wishing well

deep in autumn
the swan alone

twilight
the crow picks a tree
with lots of sky

freeze
the constellations settle
into their angles

first day of winter
the snap of a cue ball
on the break

powdered sugar snow
mom's cursive in the margin
of the recipe

cold rain
filling the carton
with her clothes

winter moon
the name only he
knows me by

silent
as a mouse
the trap

her prognosis
the sound of his axe
striking logs

mile high
adding my breath
to the clouds

what do i know
about the untethered balloon
my daughter’s embrace

his ashes
turning into the current
the turtle’s ears

casting stitches
on a circular needle
new year’s day

below zero
verbalizing
my self talk

lullaby lyrics
the graceful curve
of a snowfield

deep winter
the lemon seeds also
sliced in half

cinnamon toast 
my boys warm
from their beds

after soup
the warmth
of the bowl

icy rain
the clatter of teacups
on a wobbly cart

the potato basket
empty

snow moon 
steam rising
off the milk pail

low winter moon
just beyond the reach
of my chopsticks

sunrise at the pier 
calamari fishermen
bowing to the sea

late afternoon sun
pigeons land
on all the heroes

after fireworks
the last croaks
of roosting egrets

first love 
we mark our boundaries
with river rocks

car ride
the child draws
a silent story

drifting up
into old aspen trees 
the sound of checkers

changing his angle
changing his song
a thrush at dusk

fast moving clouds
my grandson finds stones
that fit his hands

sun-warmed room
the patina from his touch
on the hand drums

a year
wiped away
dust on luggage

waking up 
the lightest speckle of rain
on the lake

bird song
the widening span
of my son’s hand

spring morning
the art of walking beside
someone much older

mist under the bridge
the drifting shapes
of hobos

church graveyard 
from somewhere close
the fragrance of lilies

at the centre
of constant ripples
a moorhen’s nod

early spring 
the young boys spinning
till they’re dizzy

graveside 
my breasts
leaking

waxing moon
the sound of a butterfly
emerging

spring rain 
her finger shushes
my lips

moonless night
children’s muffled voices
from the snow fort

winter sky 
a skein of wild birds
unravels

blinding ice
my saw releases
the scent of pine

spring cleaning 
i never cared for the scent
of her letters

his sax echoes
in the walkway tunnel
warm wind

a wildness
blowing through the neighborhood
with the snow

cold morning
a thin cat slips in
the closing door

the wrong side of town
a paw print
collects water

cactus bloom
i decide to forgive
myself

cold spell
the man at the ballot box
reading nietzsche

both parents
in his room
snowy evening

this cold night
a child’s hunger embedded
in pixels

cold winter sky
intertwined branches
of an old beaver lodge

the reddened snow
six ravens and a coyote
removing the elk

hard frost
a dumpster’s lid
slams shut

the long sigh
of a pregnant girl
december wind

frozen solid
two withered leaves
overlap

snowy field
a small creature’s tracks
interrupted by wing prints

a russian winter 
each book weighs several pounds
on the kitchen scale

end of winter
the flannel sheets
worn smooth

spring cleaning
our cat curled up
in the give-away box

downpour
two blackbirds bathing
in cherry blossoms

bullfrog eyes
half out
dusk moon

carpooling 
i discover my colleague’s
passion for lilies

my teenager
folding paper samurai
spring wind

gathering clouds
the rusty tractor
in a deep rut

soap bubbles
from a child’s wand
spring breeze

long-stay ward
a forged signature
on the mother’s day card

quaker meeting
a breeze passing
from tree to tree

sudden chill
from across the lake
another loon

first autumn
without mother
the leaves

before dusk
that thin strip of light
under the clouds

fallen leaves 
my old dog
finds his way

thanksgiving 
holding a bite
through the prayer

mountain stream
two stone bridges
joined by mist

last leaves fall
the warmth of his voice
deep in his letters

voting day 
crows on a cedar bough
shift their weight

first frost
the smell of dust
burning in the ducts

christmas eve
cracking walnuts for his son
and his dad

autumn dusk
i wave to a girl
waving to someone else

first time up this creek
the dragonflies
won’t keep still

crescent moon
the beaver shreds
a lotus leaf

moonlit grass
a farmer whistles catfish
to the surface

our locked gate 
earth stops the falling
leaves

mushrooms tilting
into each other 
misty rain

a place under
the willow tree 
autumn rain

autumn mist
in the beggar’s hand 
his empty stare

autumn evening
her seventh rejection
of my proposal

early frost
a scatter of termites
from tonight’s log

new motorcycle
we pass through the scent
of someone’s dinner

sun-baked grasslands
the color in the wings
of blackbirds

midnight 
the last firecracker
fizzles

romanian village
when the dog has passed
the rooster crows

autumn rain
she lights her cigarette
from his

dusty hike
a snail also crossing
the dry stream

so dry 
the chaparral partly woven
into my socks

the ragged bark
of a paper birch
his death day

mother mends her shawl
with tobacco twine
curing season

crescent moon 
the street magician’s trick
finally revealed

veranda railing
a magpie stares down
the dog

early morning sounds
the stench of the cattle truck
before it arrives

setting sun 
the old man catching fish
and letting them go

autumn wind
unwinding summer’s
entanglements

forest tree 
lichen by-passes
an old wound

between fence rails
a little boy explains cows
to the cows

heat lightning
a beggar outside starbucks
shakes his cup at me

summer’s last hour
a yellow-jacket settles
in my garden glove

mountain lake
i paddle the moon path
to your cabin

leaden sky
this dead finch
weighs nothing

at the corner
the shadow
splits in two

emptying my bag
the pebble makes me
think of the hill again

a faint groove
round my ring finger
new moon

spanning
the canyon wind
california condor

such stillness
i absorb the sound
of creaking bamboo

the glitz
an ant carries 
morning sunshine

the sparkle
in our conversation
sunshine on her knees

his face
shaped by the speed
of his bike

morning meditation
a moth
works the room

country graveyard
confetti
in the grass

stiff-necked morning
a wedge of light escapes
the icicles

late winter wind
the telephone pole
already leans

the moon
almost empty
winter rain

false dawn
i listen to the world
unfurl

the cold and the rain and the wind
and
forsythia

putting away
all the winter wear
a warbler's song

teasing the tightness
out of the buds
spring sun

birds in flight
the child asks
how to grow wings

neither of us
speaking
raindrops on the tarpaulin

rain pause
the green mountains' tops
where clouds can sit

evening breeze
winding through war graves
the scent of mown grass

basking turtles
the wet shell
of the new arrival

gibbous moonlight
into our dome tent
your warm curves

greetings from
the artificial colors of
a vintage postcard

animal crackers
saving the elephants
for my granddaughter

watering roses
a toad baptized
from the pour spout

the forbearance
of being toyed with
castle-moat crab

bat wings wrap
my one and only
mango

autumn butterfly
the beauty
of last things

lily pads
rearrange
the moonlight

day moon
knowing i overstayed
my welcome

scraping
a rusty can
the sound of empty

a chipmunk
clutches its acorn
indian summer

autumn sea
the driftwood shapes
of old grief

rubbing salt
into its wounds
grandpa's cutting board

quoting lines
from a dead poet
autumn deepens

december evening
my old stetson
keeps dust off the shelf

snow globe
falling for
its little village

just before rain
a heron's wings
and temple bells

false summit
a standing marmot
drops to all fours

fence knotholes
the nose of a dog
now and then

wedding flowers
the bee here
for nothing else

her first haiku
a bunny's fresh tooth marks
in a bed of lettuce

missing
her touch
widower's garden

going with the f
low tide anemone

summer crowd
the perfect poise
of a yucca

cloud dragons
hover over the bay
blades of sun

outlasting mom
pairs of shoes
on the closet floor

two by two
old vikings on motorcycles
obeying the stop sign

shrimp boat
bringing to shore its haul
of gulls

old lab
i wonder what
his nose sees

late summer breeze
noticing the gray
in her muzzle

marsh grass
making ripples
in the ripples

neuropathy
the way she walks
with moonlight

only the clicking
of dragonfly wings
hospital garden

at the head
of the funeral procession
a sundog

boundary marker
the colors
of lichens

moonless night
even so
the blossoms of saptaparni

snowy sidewalk
a crow and a raccoon
passed this way

the way hands
remember the chords
first love

quartersawn walnut
the violin's
vibrato

morning meditation
the cat in my lap
purrs in purrs out

muffled voices
mother's pin cushion
sparkles in the light

fools
that we are
winter river

sunlit icicle
he wants to keep it
in his toy box

snow receding
the tin heron shows
some leg

spring blouse
the mannequin
clearly cold

late summer morning
the red-winged blackbird's
salty cry

pebble-seeker
a small boy shows me
his handful of summer

where the groundskeeper
took his lunch
sparrows

chairs chained
in the plaza
sunday morning

earthquake night
wind chimes repeating
one deep tone

aftermath
of the tornado
the sound of no wind

flowing under
the water striders
summer's end

moonlight
the sound leaves lend
a little wind

walking under streetlights
the short-long-short
of our shadows

equinox
the swan
in all its symmetry

uncertainties
appear in the puddles
long before the bus

spring blossoms
skyped
across the pond

she asks me
to think of her healing
soft spring rain

outdoor cafe
the april smile
of a young waitress

spring cleaning
jazz drum brushes
fade in

heat shimmer
a stick on the verge
of snake

walking
the paths we used
to run

retracing the steps
of palanquin bearers
a snail in rain

spring time
sparrows renew
their disputes

the wasp and i
trapped inside
tax forms

forced hyacinths
i imagine us
in love

spring cleaning
the piercing gaze
of a button-eyed doll

temple arch
a child on her papa's shoulders
rings the bell

wind
in the high grass
wild horses

at the speed
of wild roses
morning run

first light
bees start at the top
of the apple tree

spring afternoon
a coiled rattler
tongues the warm air

moonless
a dark lake lit
with swans

summer rain
leftover seed
sprouts from the nest

crescent moon
a june bug
fills the telescope

inspecting
the bridal arch
white butterfly

flipping a page
of the mazurka score
willow-tree wind

canyon precipice
the eaglet's peeps
falling away

sound of water
accepting more
waterfall

summer night
the stars
and my neighbors' voices

river moon
the slow bend
of the blues

moth wings
bottle gourd flowers
open to the night

coyote's wail
even the known world
unknown

the sounds and smells
of meat grilling
our nation's birthday

dead chameleon
disappearing
into tarmac

scorched paddock
the crow perched
on a ribcage

midsummer heat
a water snake
orbits the moon

misshapen by
the dead oak fallen on it
the living tree

end of friendship
bending
a paperclip

whipstitch
she goes back
to her ex

duckweed
a heron fishes between
the log and a tire

the northern summer
gnats shape
the infinity sign

playground half
the size i remember
scattered leaves

in a flash
an elk from my train window
forever

old fireplace
my grandpa's cigar
burns unevenly

snow angel
i scatter bird seed
in the wings

your mittened hand in mine
and the stars
inch closer

xmas jingles
the crunching of bone
in the dog's mouth

winter garden
a long silence
of bonsai

snowshine
digging out
to cardinal song

winter light
the artists' model shifts
her gaze

snow
on the kindling
valentine's day

waterfall
the passage of a floating leaf
slowed by wind

winter sun
she wraps up her hair
in a colored scarf

harbor stillness
a gull feather alights
on sunset colors

on her shoulders
the family rests
the scarecrow's crows

cold and windy
some with some without
acorn caps

winter chill
old goose feathers drift
on the village pond

december deluge
swept downstream
everything but the moon

into the dusk
that ends a century
a roosting bird

frosty morning
our slightly formal
greetings

bird feeder
again the squirrel comes back
to check

biting wind
the pink plastic flamingo
turns south

millennium eve
twisting the bottle
to a slow pop

night of stars
all along the precipice
goat bells ring

dawn light
the bare shadow of a tree
flickers on the wall

snowed in
the sound of my tea bag
steeping

january sun
the long pause between
icicle drips

thin ice
morning sunrays enter
the river

plywood roof
stillness seeps in
with the cold

winter sunlight
the pattern of old wallpaper
showing through

steady snowfall
reading and re-reading
my daughter's letter

song sparrow
again and again
no answer

haze-blurred horizon
a painted bunting hovers
in the sea oats' curve

deepening
deepening into the sea
twilight sky

art studio
a red amaryllis leans
on the windowpane

snake skin
caught on a blade of rock
windless day

sunset heat
distant loon wings
slap the lake

smooth stones
waves rinsing off the rain
rain rinsing off the waves

early warmth
in the backyard a flicker
pokes among rocks

someone sobbing
the watering can
full of rain

evening star
children's intimate whispers
before they reach home

the long pause
between her wish and
tossing the coin

night heron
rising from its nest of sticks
the wind

autumn rain
on a telephone wire
someone's jump rope

pond spillway
slowly through fallen leaves
a mottled snake

autumn dusk
a strip of yellow crime scene tape
flutters in the wind

open-air concert
flute arpeggios pour down
from flickering stars

this cool morning
enough dewdrops for tea
issa!

in a puddle
a leaf with a puddle
in the middle

the drunkard
tries to keep to the path
falling leaves

winter wind 
a cradlesong sung
in an ancient tongue

deep woods
a sapling with one leaf
changes color

mountain trail
a sit-here rock
padded with moss

fat moon
through every window
bull frogs

morning alarm 
father’s face
floats away

barely awake
my first steps
flush pheasant

spring dawn
my cup
full of river

soft breeze
the weaver bird loops
a blade of grass

cake crumbs 
the balloons leak
my breath

morning moon 
the mouse
on a small branch

layers of mountains 
echoing boom of the blue
grouse

a willow shoot
between river stones
morning light

the petals still creased
on a fresh primrose
moving day

wasps
among the windfalls
august light

first day of school
summer’s change
in a canning jar

waterfall
near the end of dry season
a black groove in the stone

this time
i don’t kill the wasp
summer’s end

first fall day
she speaks of taking
one more long trip

cantaloupe
the sweetness
of drought

back to school 
slug trails
on home plate

late summer wind
the marks on a hay bale
where it was bound

autumn equinox
a sunbeam divides the melon
evenly into two

new coolness 
the mushroom’s
steep tilt

brilliant moon
i hold my hand up to it
unadorned

shooting star
the warmth
of a child’s breath

ray of moonlight 
our bare feet disturb
the cedar floorboards

job listings
morning glories open
by the bay

the search light
bouncing off clouds 
new-town lonesome

autumn night 
the spruce drops
silver needles

her bedtime 
more stars
on the other side of this tree

moving day
one last look
at the elm

autumn melancholy 
the guitar in the corner
awaits my friends

starless night
from the barroom a love song
about red lips

reddening apples 
her palette
still loaded with color

an empty chair
in the poet’s circle
words of love

blue september sky 
the wordless things
we want to know

death of a friend
loss of her creative soul
inflames inspires mine

her yellow painting 
above bifocals her dark eyes
even brighter

no matter how short we may fall
my image of you
shall always stand tall

sometimes i think
you would answer the phone
if i were to call

warm earth
the gardens
it makes

moonless night 
in the harvested wheat field
i too am empty

the quiet strengths
of a gentle leader 
colors that will not fade

exchanging haiku stories
we forget we live
on different continents

one breath
the distance between
i am and i was

rereading the renga
we wrote a decade ago
my name her name

windstorm 
the garden stripped of
her bright colors

there is no ending 
only the change
of seasons

twilight lingers
the thousand echoes
of her wordless things

parting ways
the cherry branch
weighed down with blossom

distant siren 
the sound of a heifer
calving

ankle-deep
in cherry blossoms
and still alive

she uses
a kitchen chair
magnolia blossoms

new buds
the snake’s tongue
tasting air

soft rain
the clown’s smile
turns a little sad

caroling magpies
a ghost gum outlined
with light from the east

spring breeze 
fragrance of sweet grass
on the mare’s breath

mother’s day 
admiring lilacs
just past their peak

lavender farm
we mingle
with bumblebees

cold moon 
a moment of hesitation
years ago

the wrong road 
precisely placed hoof prints
of a horse

shop window
the beggar’s reflection
in new clothes

first warm day
the toy cup fills
with sunlight

first day of spring
she doesn’t ask me
why i’m late

morning shift
one star
over the mineshaft

road puddles 
umbrellas dip
at each passing car

muted sunshine
the old cat stalks
with a limp

the scent
of thawing earth
distant dinner bell

filling
a whole room 
the snapped daffodil

my father’s birthday
i spill
a box of nails

fiery sunset
her ruby fingertips
against his lips

autumn leaves 
the street singer’s
good-bye love

dark so soon
the evening after
i killed the mouse

harvest moon
the small puddle
nearly filled

getting colder
no hop left
in the grasshopper

highland lake 
burnt button grass
on both sides of the moon

day moon 
another armful
of shriveled corn

alabama farm
the scarecrow dressed
in white linen

full moon 
all our sounds
are vowels

stepping stones
the river changes
its tune

early autumn
the farmer sands a splinter
on a buggy spoke

indian summer
we need to be reminded
to let the young win

barn loft
my children scatter wheat grains
grandfather heaped up

squash blossoms
i teach my son
to count

the old couple
weed their tiny garden 
sunlight on stone

first ride
without the training wheels 
summer breeze

fresh tar
black-eyed susans
lost in the scent

menfolk 
a pup in the middle
of idle pats and scratches

thinning the carrots
still thinking about the child
miscarried

the strike of a nail
travels down the fence
dog days

rest stop 
sparrows pick the insects
from a semi’s grill

hot afternoon
the hum
of her sewing machine

the late glare
of a summer sidewalk 
winos pool their change

twirled parasol 
the lacecap hydrangeas
bleached pale blue

i don’t know
a soul at this picnic 
damselflies

second wedding
the fragrance of petals
torn from the rose

cicadas 
my strength flows
into the day’s heat

making love
the meadow
in my pockets

yuppie house 
the bougainvillea climbs
according to plan

hot sunday 
i get lost
in the knot garden

wedding reception
the unfolding tail
of a white peacock

climbing through
a haze of mayflies
summer moon

one extra push
on the oak tree swing
suppertime

almost dawn
an empty whiskey bottle
near the phone

first morning
without my old dog
my face wakes up dry

onion braids
won’t go any tighter
november evening

starry starry night
he wishes he had
a big thought

autumn morning 
passengers in the train
behind their newspapers

shattered mirror 
each image of myself
whole

foggy studio window 
the primary colors
lined up in jars

deep autumn
the candle flame flickers
as i pass

starlit sky
some brighter
than others

nearly winter 
the stilt dancer bows
to a spruce

salmon run
does the river too
have memory?

remembering him
the worn shell
still pink inside

moonlight
on the rocky side
of an oyster shell

outstretched cormorant
the sun rays filter
through my fingers

dreaming aloud
until the tide
touches our feet

island shrine
the slap of salmon
across the water

sea and sky
the sand slipping out
from under my feet

alone with my thoughts
the wet sand a mirror
between ebb and flow

high tide
jellyfish
moons

sun along the shore
even the gray cockle shells
surprise me

spring day
the cat returns with cobwebs
in his whiskers

summer cabin 
i do away
with the curtains

lunch time
the treecutter finds a tree
for shade

sunny snag
a pair of turtles slide
into thick silt

heat wave 
crayfish holes
incline to the north

boundary feud 
picking the blackberry
that breaks the web

from deep in the forest
a haunting birdsong
sung just once

ancient sequoia
straw hat
in my hand

marsh lightning
the tree’s blossoms open
into egrets

stepping stones
across the stream
your hand small in mine

cold rain
barbed wire in the middle
of an oak

the flock’s wings 
one bird veers
into silence

first snow
he promises to write
a new will

first snow
deer enter the orchard
on tiptoe

leaves falling
some on the boulder
some in the stream

the falcon
tugs at her tether 
shortest day

ice patch
the surprising strength
of mother’s grip

after the burial
my father’s smile
on so many faces

mountain stillness 
the loon call
held by the lake

a corner of dry leaves
she slowly folds
the second opinion

i raise my head
from his chest heartbeats
to crickets

first yoga session
rhythmic
creaking

husband spellbound 
his wife’s version
of their courtship

bird house empty of seed
even the jays
look for bernard

hospital vigil
the imperceptible shift
of clouds

deserted beach
missing a child’s
hand to hold

open house
my children their children
joy is my middle name

thunderclap!
a squirrel near the feeder
clutches its chest

mother’s day
gift-wrapped box of chocolates
one piece missing

steady rain
i fall short of being the human
i wish to be

migrating birds
grains of sand tumble
from her notebook

twilight deepens 
the wordless things
i know

dusk 
coiling the hose
around a glowworm

firefly night 
muffled giggles
from the small boys’ tent

war news
the cat chases
her tail

hard rain
the sizzle of summer peppers
in the skillet

tink and splat
of rain on garden tools 
ragtime in my head

summer evening
friends compete
to thread my needle

the newspaper open
a moth rests
on my knuckle hairs

distant thunder
the last cookies in the jar
both burned

predawn rain
the dog’s tail whapping
as we doze

rainy morning 
a thick-fingered teller
doles out dollar bills

raw winds
the tilt
of my flamingo

moonlit night
the shadow of a wolf
just like a wolf

orion rising
in the eastern sky
we compare secrets

worn-out stairs
up to my old mother’s home 
an owl hooting

she strokes
my thinning hair
winter moonlight

early snow
outside the window 
pomegranates

snow moon
the hunter’s
empty trap

a star falls
into the winter dark
the rumble of a train

crackling fire 
her breath
smells of cinnamon

midwinter’s night
the occasional chirrup
of the smoke alarm

late moon rising
the click of burro hooves
on cobblestones

beet water
eddies down the drain
winter evening

new year's eve
rhythm of a push-broom
high in the stadium

flowering field
the farmer's new fenceposts
squarely staked

new rain
the odour of kangaroos
from the hollow

meadowlarks glide
over the ripe grainfield
tips of deer velvet

dry arroyo
click of insects
on slabs of slate

sun blocked by clouds
mile after mile
in silence

darkening sky
between mimosa blooms
an iridescent honey-eater

spring rain
an old stone wall
between pastures

unison shifting
of graduation tassels
the expanse of sky

summit view
my friend examines
his shoes

barely dawn
the cat's slow progress
toward the kitchen

dusty temple yard
buddha's sandstone face
worn away

fallen leaves
the first words of the letter
i regret

nearly dusk
the playground astir
with dragonflies

first autumn rain
dust on the umbrella plant
interrupted

morning cool
silhouettes of the faithful
murmuring chants

war again
the starlings
fly south

autumn leaves
a cowslip blooms
out of time

a barrow of windfalls
emptying out
apple-scented rain

autumn creek
each leaf shadow haloed
in sunlight

last cast
a fisherman's breath
becomes river mist

moon shadow
an owl plucks a mouse
from rising water

afternoon burble
the yin yang of two beef tongues
in a pot

hospital ward
i try to isolate
her special scent

still water
the crayfish slips under
the sky

moon almost full
the blackness flows
downstream

falling leaves
the same old man returning
to the same old park bench

wish made
concentric ripples
spread away

vendor on the beach
from hand to hand
the spinning pinwheel

the crab points skyward
with its remaining claw
crane's shadow

evening light
following the anchor line
into the sea

rain stopped
the sunflower drips
into its shadow

buried in a coat
he never wore
autumn equinox

gray morning sky
a herring gull drops a mollusk
onto rocks

afternoon swim
in his hair
the scent of fish

factory whistle
blue morning glories
on the flag pole

autumn equinox
fresh tooth marks
in the old birch

home for christmas
my brothers argue over
the cracker jack prize

at her bedside a basket
woven of sweet grass

the dogs that barked at each other
bark together

a lost ball
among fallen leaves
his grave

freezing rain

slow to leave the meadow

a christmas beetle slips
from the child's hands

the passing year
a jetliner disappears
into gray clouds

snowfall
a child draws the horizon
on a window

the mist
from a whisper

red maple
against the white wall
of the fire station

autumn stillness
she straightens a shelf
of paper cranes

unraveled flowers
on the kimono

rain bubbles burst
in a puddle

walking meditation
the path
between fallen apples

lingering heat
the third-grade classroom
one desk short

outside view
the azure sky
fits the window frame

autumn wind
my daughter in the back yard
dancing

the scarecrow
wears a tie

midsummer's eve
the pond's last light
stirred by dipping swallows

dog days
the sun-struck arc
of the angler's cast

beach run
the salty taste
of myself

white birches
fog drifts past
the stone cairn

autumn rain
the long outside staircase
to my room

the coolness of
new sheets

water strider shadows
cross the bottom

morning fog
a worm trail ends
in a spiral

a deep bruise
i don't remember getting
autumn evening

pale sun
cherry petals drift
onto the cat's fur

power blackout
frogs boom
in the billabong

bus stop
the ladybug on my finger
spreads her wings

a clod of earth
the worm wiggles
out both sides

damselfly
for a moment only
the stony creek

willow by the pond
one branch stirs
its own reflection

remaining blossoms
a gardener rakes the sand
across his footprints

at skip rope

heat lightning

into a ditch

of a lodgepole pine

of legs

to the somersault

blossom

rise on their scaffold

through the dryer vent

in an old man's shape
another spring

the ladybug hangs on
for the ride

of the trellis

a stray bobber afloat
in the galaxy

black squirrel
leaping into an oak
rush hour wind

outside the guggenheim
the shapes
of real trees

an old maple changing
the face of it

light snow
the cookie sheet warps
in the oven

foggy morning
a buck looking in
my basement window

children scatter
across the schoolyard
leaf-catching

a swan paddles past
a no propeller sign

the delicate balance
of snow on boughs

summer moon
the sound of eggs
coming to a boil

mosquito larvae
sudden fits of motion
in the rain barrel

outside the door
i leave them there
the dog the fleas

by the sharp left turn
a white cross

tractor overturned
gathering crowd
arms folded

grinding sumi ink
rain spatters dust
on the skylight

rainstorm
in the car the rescued dog
shakes

twilight
the only car ahead
turns off

the auctioneer
pauses for breath
pony's loud snort

back and forth
leaf shadow weaves
over the loom

grandmother
giving chase again
the fat turkey

deserted beach
missing a child's
hand to hold

deep winter
a man outside the market
feeds crows from his hand

with every chop
a higher sound

autumn gusts
the ragged flight path
of a gray heron

bubblegum on my shoe
the little girl in the red coat
skips to school

lightning storm
bridge cards face-down
on the table

winter rain
against the window
the cactus has flowered

sunny spring day
cat meowing to no one
in particular

freshly turned earth
in the palm of my hand
radish seeds

dandelions
a lone runner
circling the field

whiter still
on the moonlit windowsill
easter lily

slanting rays
in the paloverde blossoms
warm breeze

stone wall
between two rocks
a bleeding heart

cooking together
the rosemary and garlic
from our garden

spring evening
a heron moves slowly north
piercing the pond

twilight
the scent of orange blossoms
lingers

late summer downpour
the garden drain spewing
rose petals

night breeze
the lake held still
by waterlilies

alpine meadow
i lean on my walking stick
to pick blueberries

small town square
old men brush the leaves
from a checkerboard

eye of the storm
deep in the current
a gold leaf turns

rattle of wind
through a plastic pinwheel
the toddler takes a step

skinny-dipping
the pale backs of city boys
in the moonlight

shadows and veins
shaping a red leaf
one brush stroke

winter wood
in with a hawk
sudden silence

moon on the lake
someone has stolen
all my clothes!

tossing and turning
all through the night
mockingbird song

morning fog
the scent
of eucalyptus

thinking about you
the remarkable redness
of this tomato

a maple seed
floats in the millpond
deep blue sky

the cat
reworks his litter
summer dusk

all saints' day
the rooster crows
again and again

garden path
in the space between thoughts
the first drop of rain

full moon
she nurses her infant
in the garden

that dull gleam
through the hazy park
a playhouse window

the shallows
pond grass connected
to the moon

setting star
the mountain rises
black with night

mist across the lake
a loon's tremolo
slips through

winter fog
the horn of a freighter
heading out to sea

thick haze
from a burning hillside
moonrise

balmy night
pushing the crocheted throw
back to her side

morning fog
down by the bayou a heron
spears a fish

snow-covered mountains
i return my wristwatch
to the travel bag

kids find pokemon
in the blossom-petal patterns
the rain-drenched wall

sunlit garden
the scent
of my straw hat

his grave
a butterfly lands
on a plastic flower

desert mist
one sidewinder takes its place
alongside another

distant traffic hum
the stone buddha's
moss-filled crevice

spring snowflakes
melting as fast as they fall
these daydreams

oar-scoop whirlpools
spin behind the boat
calm spring day

first communion
bleeding hearts sway
beside the path

the third-note rise
of a towhee's song
fragrant breeze

frosty night
the drip of sap
into a bucket

milking hour
a whitish mist moves
toward the moon

autumn picnic
down the leaf-strewn table
daddy longlegs

valley oak
all the colors of fall
in a single leaf

stiff wind
shadows of things
stretch on the street

starry night
fragments of conversation
drift over new snow

hawks circle
the sound of a tedder
turning hay

october wind
from inside the peach
the smell of rain

a cloud moves
onto the moon crescent
the thinness of it

spring ritual
pulling out roots to make room
for roots

wedding vows
butterflies flicker in the light
of a church window

birdwatcher
is it a male
or a female?

bright spring morning
the kitten backs away
from the coffee cup

spring sun
in the shadow of a bucket
a black button

shrove tuesday
i confide my sins
to a white butterfly

nourished by crude seeds
yet how beautifully
the song sparrow sings

jacaranda flowers
the twin tracks
of a car

alone in the woods
i turn my head
to sneeze

dwindling light
in a small child's hand
the first fallen leaf

gray morning
the slow beat of a heron
against the wind

cattle truck
a cowbell swinging
from the guard rail

bright sun
the redness of the fox
against the snow

first day of spring
at the snowbank's edge
a muddy puddle

shadows fade
into a glowing fog bank
winter geese

first snowflake
shivering of the universe
on an eyelash

beyond the gate
the stretch of sky goes
uninterrupted

morning stillness
sunlight dapples
the ropes of the swing

with added wrinkles
the paper samurai
assumes its pose

village common
the newly painted clock tower
missing its hands

gentle wind
a silkworm spinning
on its thread

old pond
hesitant
i dip my net

low sun
the glass blower twirls
a tear-shaped vase

cicada at noon
on the mountain trail
summer's end

long afternoon
a fly rides
the pendulum

bench in the woods
empty
except for my thoughts

down in the sunken garden
the last lantern
flickering

days lengthen
the amaryllis topples
under its own weight

first father's day
without him

rickety fence
a spring calf stretches toward
younger grass

before the curtain
the drama of schoolgirls
in the audience

summer clouds
a child scatters popcorn
on the fish pond

a spring wind
coins in the cup
of a sleeping beggar

churchyard clover
around our shadows
brighter green

fireworks
the whiteness
of her throat

heavy rain
bending one into another
purple hollyhocks

darknesses within
the outlines of shadows
midnight deer

morning frost
the moon too
is melting

first snow
i twist the tea bowl
to see its old design

silver vixen
moonlit snowflakes float
into her cage

christmas morning
the croak of a crow
from across the fields

through the empty
wine glass on the sill
the moonlit sea

strawman
morning sunlight glitters
on his coat of ice

first stars
a snowflake slides
from an eyelash

january rain
at the edges of my nap
the old cat kneading

washed windows
a place to splatter
the spring rain

the child's face
speckled eggs
in the abandoned nest

thunder clap
the twins
jump

early morning
the slanted shadow
of the pink house

tornado warning
the sprinkler's
tiny  hiss

winding garden path
a little girl splashes through
multi-colored puddles

red plums
her steady hand slips
between the bees

dawn-tinged window
a cicada  swells
into its song

sheen of web
across a shattered pot
the barn's splintered light

dark june night
bulls' bellowing
echoes across the hollow

ocean horizon
touching the curvature
of a white shell

summer day
walking barefoot beside
grandchildren's footprints

a flatbed
hauling scrap metal
summer heat

sunlight on the wall
brushing against the yellow
my deep blue shadow

parking lot at dawn
gulls roosting among
upturned shopping carts

morning sun
the peach's blush
deepens near the pit

noon sun
picnic cheese
sweating

ripples of light
across an oak plank floor
the wheelchair's wobble

storm clouds brew
a crone on the mountain road
draws tight her black cloak

ready to carve
a smile on it
this orange moon

harvest moon
migrant kids eat the bread
tossed to the crows

november wanes
the farmer's pet gander
honks at the moon

snow moon
a white mantle
on the scarecrow's coat

a steady drizzle
the pitchfork in the bale
slowly darkens

mischief night
the orb weaver waits
at the edge of its web

smoke-scented air
a squirrel burrows
in the woodpile

fireplace heat
in my socks
winter morning

cold dusk
my thoughts pass through
a crow flying by

moonlit door
the cat's ears point
to the dark

church door locked
a hollow sound
answers my knock

stranded jellyfish
swallowing sand
winter moonlight

the blue heron's
six foot wing span folds
a breeze smoothes the willow

writing letters
the cry of a night bird
near my house

lost at night
on a country road
falling stars

winter sunset
in the shrimp boat's wake
pink pelicans

sun after rain
the bare crabapple
luminescent

all the way home
the wind at my back
new year's day

propped on the porch
a brand new pair of crutches
steady spring rain

gust of wind
the candy wrapper tacks across
a puddle

specimen skull
holes
for the rabbit's ears

an old woman's garden
jasmine spills over
the stone fountain

daffodil
the splatter of sleet
in its cup

spring sun
raindrops
on the red camellia

wind in the tree
tree in the wind
blue sky

twilight
the parked tractor
still warm

the stutter
of the kettle heating up
snow-flecked camellia

new grass
two white horses
touching necks

autumn rut
the bull elk's bugling echoes
and re-echoes

day ending
without sunset night coming
without stars

early winter light
a flock of starlings rise
from the shadows

crescent moon
moths come touching
spikes of the iris

tumbled-in barn
blackberry cane
in full bloom

birdfeeder
still full when we return
autumn chill

unrolled as usual

pictures of ancestors
washed by rain

a neighbor names
the tree by my door

the fan blows his notes
in all directions

warm sunlight
in deep green leaves
the arrow's path

city park
children gathering coins
in the dried lake

retirement home
unfinished jigsaw puzzle
on the corner table

august moon
no one speaks
of the humidity

a briefcase
flung open on the table
jungle orchids

with the mower off
i expected to hear
more

spring night
one leg over
the blanket

a snagged lure
dangles from the deadfall
sunshine on the hooks

wind bursts the peonies
only a few strewn petals
land in pairs

ebb tide
the shell i keep reaching for
carried further away

sunday bells
the first ripe mulberry
sweetens the shade

summer solstice
spitting cherry pits
into the river

his ninety-seventh
the white peony nods
in table sunshine

saturday
a single sailboat
in the shipping lane

waterfall mist
sunrays spread out
into the woods

freezing fog
a sparrowhawk clings
to the aviary wire

below zero
her casket descends
into its hole

february sun
on the graveyard wall
i warm my hands

cold sun
the wild currant blossoms'
red fragrance

snowmelt on a familiar road
strangers' names return
to mailboxes

record cold
the salesman's bible
open on the counter

for a grave
next to his loved one
the extra daffodils

a circle of light
cupped around it in the snow
purple crocus

muddy boots
everywhere the gurgle
of freshets

mountain forest
only the sound of
snow melting

sea mist
the scent of the night
it spent in the pines

spring rain
from the woodshed
a hen's cackle

bus stop
under a mango tree
the squeak of fruit bats

the stranger's binoculars
from hand to hand
chicks in the heron's nest

late night walk
swollen in spring mist
the lights from the bridge

first camellia
along a stony path
in the morning fog

last night's rain
cupped in a banana leaf
a small green frog

sudden gust
the young starling
fans its tail

the young cat
follows each sound
knitting needles

new year
poised above the rice paper
the ink-blackened brush

throwing off the comforter
storm windows rattling
in the nursery

the day's first bull
trots into the ring
snow on the mountains

first raindrops
the neighborhood dog and chainsaw
stop

rusty stovepipe
leaking blue woodsmoke
winter sky

night wind
one star in the bare crabapple
comes and goes

houseflies
on the windowsill
dead of winter

all around
the parking meter
spring rain!

evening shadows
picking blackberries
through barbed wire

a desert wind
stirring at the trailhead
fragrant sage

cricket chorus
in the deep gravel ravine
jewel weed

the rain falls lightly
on water-jar lids

my bookmark
a yellow leaf

in coiled razor wire
a sparrow's nest

growing out of a stone wall
one white flower

a beetle drops
into a fissure

the coolness of water
held in their shapes

into birdsong

fills with light

at the fuchsia

she unwinds her rosary
from the buddha's shoulders

a cardinal singing
in the bent birch

puddled field
the cat finds sunlight
on a fence post

cancer again
the slope
of his shoulders

june breeze
a hole in the cloud
mends itself

rain and more rain
ripping off the month
two days early

in the corner
just the warm sun
and the rocker

glass of lemonade
wind leafs through the book
left on the railing

sunset
waves break
into darkness

the dull clack
of a channel marker
bent dune grass

clock face
the precise shadow
of a small spider

reading the paper
the dog sniffs
my shoes

blank drawing pad
a violet damselfly
resting at the edge

ocean fog
hunched on the white road sign
a small white heron

pond reflection
it's only wind
that puts on wrinkles

goldfish weave through light
among the reeds

against the attic roof
heavy rain

on a wrought iron fence

eye fixed
on the changing sky
a dead sparrow

in the pond a lily pad
wobbles

while getting the paper
the smell of a skunk

the old roller skate key
warms in my hand

evening rain
i braid my hair
into the dark

chilly wind
a marmot whistles
from the moraine

on yellow stucco
the church bells of florence

cracked ice
the eagle's tail feathers
spread wide apart

black ice
a snow swirl from the lake's edge
in slow motion

winter sunset
high in the willow
an egret

cold clear night
after the candle flickers out
blue moonlight

taking the stairs
two at a time
snowlight on the ceiling

winter barnyard
cows in the sunlight
sheep in the shade

quaker meeting
through stovepipe-heated air
the world shimmers

summer clouds
the faraway look
in a stranger's eyes

dusty trail
the same thoughts
as yesterday

summer's end
as the stream turns
colored leaves follow

end of summer
outside the bookstore
paperbacks curl

gladiola frond
silhouette of a cricket
on the other side

wilderness trail
the manicured poodle
still on a leash

base of the falls
a rainbow
breaks into foam

the river
the town also spilling out
of the mountains

full moon
half dark  half light
the sea

too bright
to contain itself
ring around the moon

cold wind
the crow leans
to caw

a late snow
someone
sighs

just now it comes
in the tightfurled poppy buds
a looser look

spring haze
a sparrow finishes
the redpoll's song

dry trees
the wind sharpens
its sound

bitter cold
the juniper berry parts
the jay's beak

and after such a year
the first crocus
in its usual place

ribboning through
the bed of pansies
pale green gartersnake

a long detour
around cloud mountain
mud-caked boots

a mind of its own
the gate to the school yard
in the spring breeze

lazy day
our wrist watches
on the ice chest

dampened weeds
weaving them over and under
spokes of the basket

summer sunbeams
through the gym's high fan blades
the world of dust

spreading my jacket
between bare roots

flat on our backs in the grass
analyzing clouds

all the way into mexico

of swallows

on the roof late

in the moon

the stone buddha's eyes
remain closed

geese in formation

merging

along the fallen spruce
wren song

a silo's silver cap
looms out of the fog

autumn
the church steeple reappears
in the blue sky

kitchen table
wild flower bouquet
beer bottle vase

birdbath
the rising sun
splashed with bluejays

bend in the road
the plodding turtle
curves its neck

along with the tide
a ribbon of kelp
fishes itself ashore

bamboo in snow
but for a sung painter's art
i'd have passed it by

passing sailboat
the jetty cormorant's
outstretched wings

rising sun
a gull high in the space
between us

roses i meant to pick
their golden petals
taken by wind

winter sunshine
the yellow kitchen
even more welcoming

mid-winter doldrums
the stone angel
with a handful of snow

starlings leave
the leafless tree
the silence

starless night
a slice of stale bread
divided by five

l'heure bleu
i find my house
when the neighbor's dog barks

melted snowman
one white cloud drifts
across the puddle

ice moon
an elk touches its tongue
to the salt lick

pruned from the honey locust
cold wind

winter storm
growing puddles
of candle wax

her gravestone
the smooth place
no longer there

evening sunrays
the tap roots of turnips
left in dry ground

pioneer house
the scent of smoke trailing
through the dark rooms

october snow clouds
the wasp nest's outer coverings
flap in the wind

slingshot
the pebble misses
a star

into the tunnel
late autumn fades
in the rear view

one stroke
splits the log
a crow caws

misty foothills
a woodpecker scarcely dents
the thick-spread silence

squirrel bones
between tree roots
needles falling

full moon
i wonder which state
his jet is crossing

first snowflakes
darkness and my face
on the windowpane

light snowfall
the tick of an engine
cooling

a whinny
stops his shovelling
deep winter

winter rain
preening itself the swan
drifts backwards

morning rush
a street sweeper roars
over plum petals

a public bench
lit by one street lamp
the falling snow

the silence
after late night snow
a pinecone falls

winter blues
the gnaw of my boots
on old snow

first day alone
a breeze fills my lap
with plum blossoms

sunlit meadow
my small knight chases
dragonflies

covered with graffiti
shimmering heat

dazzles

as he closes the box

on the casket

with a cardboard box

warm from the dryer

the geese overhead
fade into snowflakes

in the handicap parking
piles of snow

trimming the tree
his brother's ornament
nearest the angel

on grandma's menorah

on a zucchini leaf

gone to seed    the dry flick
of grasshoppers

a woodpecker
in the lightning scar

fills the tea room
evening chill

in circles

approaching storm
minnows dart
in the bait bucket

twilight
the meadow
cricketing

hermitage
a small hole dug
deep in an acorn

pear scent
from the sake cup
winter moon

gray morning
the icicle grows
by another drop

deathbed
out the open window
the open sky

just now
as my life turns crazy
forsythia

dying embers
nodding off to the sound
of tree frogs

northern lights
filtering through fir trees
a distant train whistles

creek grasses
bent seaward
winter rain

new grave
a sparrow tugs
at a ribbon

early morning
a snail
in my sandal

mid-argument
a bumblebee
stumbles in clover

a spider weaves
among the rosehips
no one at home

schoolyard quiet
the scribble of ants
in a stone shadow

summer highway
puddles of light merge
with the sky

the striped racer
slithering to full length
canyon wildflowers

an ant swings
on a grass blade

a gull separates
from the rest of the flock

the baby nods
cottonwood seeds
drift along the road

bending
heatwaves

a raven's caw
in with the knife

nightfall
the shape of his knees
in the hanging jeans

hot night
magnolia blossoms
in the moonlight

no rain
spiders web the holes
in a patio umbrella

hot sun
a canoe full of corn grains
losing gold

dusk on the estuary
a school of bass break
the shallow tide

writing to an old friend
a firefly just outside
my window

night music
fireworks mingle
with the stars

a thin trail
to the spider's nest
wet paint

again i take
the wrong way
those violets!

cloudless sky
a great blue heron wades
through pond scum

thunder clouds
landing with the first raindrops
dark-eyed junco

spring afternoon
the sound of a bee bouncing
off the window

getting to know you
a timer goes off
in the kitchen

narrow path
bees swarm between us
and the sea

sunlit reeds
the slender line
of the bittern's beak

spring rain
the measured step
of a sandhill crane

summer shower
my face flows down
the windowpane

dog days
another block of hay
pops out of the baler

grit in the stomach
of the steamed clam
summer heat

smoldering coals
the rattle of blue crabs
in a metal bucket

amber shallows
a perch nibbles
the sky to pieces

the slow blink
of radio tower lights
autumn chill

noon sun
the cow chews her cud
clockwise

midday sun
my shadow
to the ocean floor

passing thunderclouds
a waterstrider's rush
to stay in place

autumn river
pulled together on the deck
two white chairs

warm night
one moth still bumps
the extinguished lamp

first cold day
the slower pace
of big black ants

gaining an hour
i water the marigolds
one more time

withering leaves
the lawyer to write his will
rings the doorbell

mother's bedroom
the silver thimble
catches moonlight

vacation's end
a dead cockroach
in the bathtub

late summer chill
the old headstones trailing back
into the pines

autumn wind
men in wrinkled suits
argue with the cab driver

other lights
than our own
the milky way

snow-laden cherry
a broken branch
dropping blossoms

morning song
the orange ring
'round the blackbird's eye

reclusive neighbor
spearmint from her garden
comes over to mine

cresting waves
red feet of a puffin
paddle the air

egret
for its landing on the river
a giant lily pad

sunrise
the goldfinch continues
its song

one wing
folded against the other
colors of a dead butterfly

dark clouds
a blanket of purple nettle
on the indian mound

morning haze
she tries jasmine
in her hair

sunlit porch
a butterfly alights
on mail from overseas

spring melancholy
a field of rape flowers
gone to seed

sweet peas
tremble on the trellis
the bride's i will

melon blossoms
a yellow-powdered bee
wipes its face

cloudless sky
a pheasant flies from
the combine's teeth

the garden butterfly
my daughter not close enough
then too close

afternoon hush
the cat takes another step
towards a robin

thunderclap
the cadence of the rain
changes

family picnic
the youngest child pockets
a watermelon seed

starry sky
the honks of wild geese
rise from the quarry

cold moon slides
up the long window
shadow of her hand

bare winter prairie
a little smoke rises
from an empty field

autumn wind
a tiny spider husk
spins in the moonlight

a cottonwood stump
brought in by the tide
sparrow song

solitary walk
dragging the stars
through pines

first frost
a daddy-long-legs
skims over bright leaves

prairie arroyo
half-grown bison bulls
corral the trucks

churchyard manger
knots in the plywood backs
of the wise men

daymoon
the branch of a birch
laden with crows

nearly sunset
the spider shadow moves
in the curtain

summer dusk
the town hall clock
drowns a drunk

early dusk
toward the fingernail moon
a vee of geese

night rain
a glimpse of deer antlers
between wiper blades

leaving each shadow
as it was
evening breeze

red berries
at the tip of each branch
the setting sun

subway stairs
the old man climbs
into autumn

autumn wind
goldfinch feathers cling
to the gravel

red maple leaves
i sip the last
drops of wine

airport wait
a one-legged blackbird
adjusts to the wind

autumn sunset
mississippi backwater
flooded with color

moonlight
a spider spins
between the scarecrow's legs

end of summer
the rust on my scissors
smells of marigolds

autumn sky
the perfect blue
of dragonfly eyes

evening train
windfall apples scattered
near the tracks

finding my way
with every turn
the full moon

conversation lags
far out on the spindly branch
a withered leaf

year's end
her skipping rope
too short

new year's day
an orca leaps
over the gray swell

adding a squawk
to the scrabble of mice
rusty hinge

starry night
frost patterns grow
from the window's edge

winter rain
tufts of moss
on the flagstone steps

winter wind
sandpipers chase
their voices

winter sky
three geese wheeling
around around

frosting the window
with our breath
tick-tack-toe

year's end
this unfinished
poem

the mourning ends
walking out
into new sunlight

approaching rain
a second wren tips
the tall thistle

garden path
the child sorts good rocks
from bad rocks

line drive to center
all faces turn toward
the sunflower field

january 1st
fresh grave being covered
by snow

two red cedars
joined in their early years
grown apart with age

walking the old paths
i am again
a child!

every now and then
he swats at a fly
midday heat

autumn stillness
a magpie shakes seeds
from the torch weed

family reunion
an assortment of onions
in the stew

deep autumn
the last jigsaw piece
snaps into place

winter pasture
the gray mare favors
one leg

ice floes
the wing of a gull
brushes a star

church bells
a dragonfly
flying low

getting dark
grandpa searches too long
for the north star

the deep curve
of each narrow leaf
first snowfall

evening shadows
a mouse darts
from the fireplace

summer drought
next to her rose tattoo
a pale blue vein

steps fade
her scent lingers
among thorns

vapor trail
between here and there
spider working a web

distant thunder
the spindly legs
of a crane fly

scarecrow
still measuring
the vast summer sky

opening night
the dark rose unfurls
its scent

guided hike
beyond the talk
quiet woods

sharing with a grandchild
the secrets
of clouds

raindrops
a stink bug swings
on the half-ripe berry

cry of the finch
wrapped in hawk talons
scattered seeds

mud-spattered pickup
four dogs watch
the tavern door

hiking trail
a tarantula and i
back up together

woodland stream
among the sword ferns
quivers of light

business trip ending
my shadow pulls a briefcase
from the car trunk

thunderclap!
a squirrel near the feeder
clutches its chest

saguaro shadow
the packrat hiding
something bright

river crossing
the gap between
stones

how much
do the neighbors know?
my grass grows long

high above
the end of this long day
sliver of moon

sunday morning
a neighbor comes out
to clap his shoes

floating
through my thought
butterfly

rose trellis
a butterfly adjusts
its flight

garden swing
cat and butterfly
in mid-air

three fiddlers
a dog weaves between
pints of stout

she speaks softly
she speaks of daffodils
i write it down

bumblebee
the buzz
between flowers

cool summer morning
i take my thoughts
out to the porch

warm kitchen
the rise and fall
of friends' laughter

first valentine
in the kindergarten box
scent of fresh paste

back home
trees that i knew
in all their seasons

dark river
shadows of gypsies
around the fire

slipping over morning fields
a sunray
catches the hare's urine

raveled mitten
bird tracks crisscross
patio snow

winter branches
a spray of snow
from the magpie's tail

dusk
the stillness of swans
in a flooded field

on the old
flowering quince
a quince

day moon
dandelion seeds
drift by

green tea in white cups
an oriole holds forth
from a high branch

my synagogue route
from a draped moslem woman
grandma's scent

sunny afternoon
a bee follows wildflowers
into my car

empty sandals
on the beach
pull of the moon

spring sky
the unfocused stare
of a newborn

dead pear tree
for ten days each spring
it was white with blossom

a few snow patches
white steer faces peer
above wildflowers

a cajun song
in the evening air
lilacscent

winter morning
the shower pipes
change pitch

morning stillness
first squeak
from the squirrel's cage

cloud shadow
the volcano
changes shape

a wild daisy
by grandfather's grave
our son mows around it

spring sky
two magpies fill
the pine

first light
beads of water linger
on the prayer plant

january rain
catching a glimpse of my son
as i pass the school

bluestem grasses
melodic echoes
of a bugling elk

nest-building
a bird carries a clump
of cat hair

mammogram
morning snowflakes
stick

processional
cold wind lifts one corner
of the pall

a long breath
from the shakuhachi
my hands become a bowl

melting snow
the water in its own path
off the path

summer heat
the deep red
of his boutonnière

mom's birthday
the phone line drops
an icicle

funeral bouquet
her monochrome photo
amid pink and purple

small talk with the mailman
i sign the receipt
for mother's ashes

light breeze
an ant moves
among woodpecker craters

lightning flash
how short
the stubble

cloudcast afternoon
corn popping
on the stove

an old man's breathing
barely moves the newspaper
winter dusk

winter stars
shaking rust down from
the old swing set

grand canal
row on row of gondolas
tossing at their stakes

crochet hook
pulling the yarn through
deep november

porch sitting
the scallop of snowy hills
in his gesture

bright venus
two hawks settle
deep in the pine

tattered windsock
a harbor seal slips between
two dinghies

reddening sky
the car park empties
gull by gull

the shelter of a tree
neither of us knows
the other's name

after the rain
the field's clean shine
watermelons

humid night
a small child's crying
wavers to a stop

summer twilight
the strolling path dips
into coolness

steady summer rain
the gull takes a few short steps
in the puddle

on the beach
the tracks of two
lounge chairs

steamed up window
with long oblique lines
a child draws the rain

humid night
the scarecrow engulfed
in grapevines

winter solstice
out-of-town snow
comes in with the coal train

icy morning
a small crackling
from the woodstove

tabletop fountain
the doctor's bedside manner
in his voice

foot-long icicles
what to do with the spider
in the fruit  bowl?

new year's day
my son lets the tide
seep into his sneakers

window frost
the moon
through a thumbprint

her hospital room
snow filling the small field
next to the big one

christmas eve
in the courtyard below
a flutter of wings

new century
the neighbor's rusty car
still on blocks

evening sun
boys playing cricket
on the river bed

nightfall
wingbeats of blackbirds
deep in the thicket

sunrise
meets the shore
wave after wave

a breeze
through paper lanterns
the dancer lifts her fan

ivy league quad
a squirrel gathering nuts
looks me over

old mission
desert wind swinging
clapperless bells

calm sea
a huge tree trunk
washed up on the shore

our lips touch
the surf moves sand
beneath my feet

evening light
the red dragonfly
as still as the riverstone

a hawk's eye
autumn gusts rattle
the beech leaves

shifting clouds
an alligator swallows
the big yellow moon

recess over
leaves swirl around
children in line

a crow
on the top-most branch
winter solstice

morning meditation
the goldfish
winks

catching a cricket
and letting it go
hunter's moon

yellow leaves
a girl plays hopscotch
by herself

end of autumn
only thistle
left in bloom

cold day
the teacher untangles me
from the lotus position

dew-spangled meadow
a pickup leaves
new ruts

insistent buzz
behind venetian blinds
indian summer

funeral procession
the second this week
autumn rain

walking back with my answer
her feet change the leaves
under the maple

autumn haze
a monk in saffron robes
rakes the sand

october sun
my wife pins hydrangeas
to the clothesline

indian summer
a maple leaf drawn back
into the eddy

path to the bridge
the usual leaves
and acorns

in the midst
of autumn trees the one
autumn tree

the rhythmic whirr
of a neighbor's sprinkler
star-filled night

the german pointer
holds position

gray dawn
the precise strokes
of a crow's wings

a flight of starlings
pours into the ditch

behind every other sound
the patter of rain

a rain dancer kneels
under the stars

i watch a spoon
gather the dawn

the gas pump handle
steals my warmth

owl eyes reflect
from the saguaro

afternoon heat
the beggar's book
without a cover

mountain ginko
all the haiku
a little breathless

forest fringe
one fallen leaf
changes the landscape

the dog brings
a dirty sock to bed

cold rain
one squirrel backs another
to the branch's end

twilight
three magnolia seeds
left in the pod

autumn wind
mustangs sniff
at the dry waterhole

harvest moon
the silver trunks
of dead trees

detox unit
the apple leaf curls in
from both sides

a bull's eye
on a cardboard box
autumn haze

moonstruck
the circle of calm
after a seal dives

first snow
a schoolgirl twirls
with a friend

winter solstice
moving the scale
to a lighter place

city lake
on the transparent ice
a brick

autumn dusk
the bright end of a log
between pines

starry night
one after another
deep autumn crickets

drawn to the train
in the toy shop window
snow flurries

new millennium
a bed of volcanic rocks
in the aquarium

crisp morning
the yellow cactus
blooms anyway

late day sun
small pieces of ice floating
on the river

a small yellow leaf
on his neatly combed hair

empty shelf
dusty outlines of books
my parents read

river of stars
the channel light
flashing green

winter sun
a cyclist pedals
against the wind

first snow
on the wheat stubble
the young fox pounces

maple leaves
piled up at the cabin door
stars in the trees

new moon
lamplight fills the holes
in a shot-out stop sign

train whistle
in the night it is music
of far away places

a small hoot
moonlight reveals
the rest

daybreak
trotting down the sidewalk
one gray coyote

foggy morning
a chrysalis clings
to the eaves

autumn creek
the thrush hops
to a smaller rock

the storm clears
a mockingbird sings
in the moonlight

lunar eclipse
a white moth struggles
in the web

bitter words
last night's tea steeps
in the microwave

sunrays on the pond
mallards fly single file
toward the horizon

mound of dirt
my son asks if ants
bury their dead

sultry afternoon
biting into
the bargain cheddar

summer day
shadows of cumulus clouds
rush over the hills

a flower-lined path
the latchkey kid
lets himself in

tiny bubbles
where the moose was
a cluster of flies

afternoon heat
the vireo's endless
question answer

huge trees in the park
a different dog
chasing the stick

hot afternoon
a finch vanishes
down the chimney

warm blueberries
a sand path winding
into sunset

i take the strongest
of my walking sticks
first cherry blossoms

first kiss
the lilacs still heavy
with last night's rain

sunlight
in the tidepool
each grain of sand

incoming tide
a crab shell floats under
the cormorant shadow

garden path
the apprentice
puzzles over stones

under the fallen log
a long slender stem
lavender cyclamen

nodding off
a butterfly reflection
glides downstream

red dawn
the discord
of warbling finches

red wagon
the sound of soda bottles
along a pebbled path

village square 
old faces borrowing angles
from the stone

her only nipple
begins to harden
a new year

written exams 
into the silence
the scent of peeled orange

with last year’s garden

back to white

its burden of snow

devoured by mice

one unwed year
into the next

the flutter of leaves
under my wiper

week after christmas
an empty throne
in the mall

snow-covered cornfield
the wild geese
in rows

single living
i allow the tea kettle
a full whistle

through the open door
of the outhouse
mountain fog

the bird’s twitter
chainsawed

meteor shower
i dust off the grit
of shingles

a house sparrow’s poop
pings a chime

first winter night 
stifling heat
in the chicken shack

lake in the mist 
hearing it reclaim
a fish

alarm call
i too
look for the hawk

late-night quarrel
the moon
above it all

halloween 
a passing plane
lights the fog

the long night
a gecko echoes
another gecko’s cry

cold sky
my boots grind stones
in the dry wash

clanging buoy 
how many voices
does the sea have?

cold rain 
tips of new tulips
rim the muskeg

the ewe wants to be petted
in all the old places

a door-to-door salesman
lengthens his stride 
the scent of wisteria

the glint of white
in the raven’s eye

the cattails
lose their heads
march wind

night rain
the new puppy suckles
in his sleep

one white lily
in the koi pond 
mother’s day

the observatory dome
opens wide 
moths

the longest night
a snow-covered pine
bends toward earth

shortest day 
all of the yellow
beaten out of eggs

christmas eve 
my children pretend
to snore

morning twilight
stars fade
but the cardinal

the bite of radish
in the dinner salad 
year’s end

the shortest day 
an orange traffic cone
where the oak stood

first snow man
his nose lost to
a passing horse

morning light
the curtain edges
darken

new year’s eve 
a man digging a pit
strikes his shadow

new year’s day
three fancy toothpicks
for the avocado pit

even without dewdrops
all those hairs
on the caterpillar

tobacco harvest 
the first drops of rain
on a tin-roofed shack

desert oil field
pump silhouettes
glow in the sunset

resting here
long after someone gave a name
to this ocean

wind in the trees
my dreams also fly
over the hill

distant lightning
cottonwood seeds drift
over the dry earth

clouds part 
a mantis silhouette
through the sunlit leaf

beyond the lights
of the amusement park
rhythm of the sea

first evening cool
a preening goose
spreads one wing

limestone ledge 
winding through autumn colors
the sound of a creek

morning tide
the seaside town
smells of breakfast

valentine’s day 
thawing a wild salmon
from the supermarket

planetarium
my child’s grip
starts to loosen

glare ice
the old dog
pees on the moon

sun-bright morning
dragons of factory smoke
dissolved by wind

after all the things
that have gone wrong 
plum blossoms

i find myself
losing the trail
greening woods

spring cleaning 
my daughter finds the key
to the music box

wind blown snow
a ewe’s cry
in the night

mild winter
the shore ice
releases its litter

measuring a life
from crocus
to crocus

songbirds returning
the tunes my father
would whistle

trail frog
the children
jump back

skin
is all i know of me
distant thunder

desert motel
opening the door
to starlight

screened window
the full scent
of jasmine

heirloom roses
she crunches eggshell
into the black loam

beads of rain
raspberries holding on
to summer

near the horizon
a wave forms
touch me there again

moonflower
a love letter
to captain kirk

city alley
the heart of an iris
holding rain

building thunderhead 
the white hydrangea
touched with blue

morning walk
the stranger’s dog
knows my scent

olive sea
i disappear into another
gray day

too late
to call him dad
autumn leaves

the flutter of the sail
as it loses wind

pale moon
my childhood gone
with her last breath

baby photos
from my birth mother
how do i say hello to me

lame doe at dusk
shifting the weight
of my day

mom’s ashes pass
through airport security
autumn evening

first night of fall
most of the moon
spills through the leaves

another dream
about the otherworld 
pressed flowers

old postcard
a steamship voyage
on a stamp

early spring
specks from the sky
settle near the river

the robin’s song
garlic shoots
lift the soil

daylight saving
the neighbor’s pregnancy
begins to show

butterbur
the rabbits explore
a little further

stuffed in a bus
the scent of spring
in a woman’s musk

inside the bud
all the reasons
to believe

the swell
before the river splits
into another name

from the far bank
the two-note squeaks of coot chicks
strobe the river

outdoor wall
banyan shoot curls
in my shadow

in the stream
a lone fisherman
that once was me

piano practice
leaves swirl
allegro con brio

scudding moon
a starfish holds fast
to the hull

neck
and neck 
geese

first names
no longer in fashion
weathered headstones

between roots and branches
centuries
and a child’s swing

autumn wind
i take what i want
of the apples

october fest
too much oom-pah-pah
in the mustard

leaves in the wind
this time
i let him go

godless month
a double rainbow
spans the mourners

first snow
cascading through cedar
a woodpecker’s call

first flakes
the nowhere voices
of geese

the snow
follows grace
stone soup

first
in the last trash bag 
the box it came in

winter frost 
the sword’s sharp shine
out of the sheath

a rose petal
in the singing bowl
first blackbird

all saints’ day dusk
a blackbird’s alarm call
sets off another

folding the map
part of the country ends
in the ocean

new year’s day
the cloud that held the mountain
lets go

winter thaw
tasting spiced cider
on my lover’s tongue

bare trees
a request for an update
of my bio

a grain of rice
on the mayor’s face
new year’s levee

winter chill
turkey vultures circling
one of their own

long train
the roundness of snow
on tanker cars

winter tulips
squeaking
as they enter the vase

rabbits at dusk
as if foxes did not also
love twilight

january 
the gym crowded
with resolutions

forecasted storm
the low-battery
in my kindle

hunger moon
the sound of squirrel teeth
on a hazelnut

winter mist
at the stoplight pink sneakers
keep running

lent is over
a bartender flips
the coaster

rustle of palm leaves
fishermen play cards
in the boat’s shade

roadside walk
a beggar stretches
leg as hand

fiddlers’ festival
the bull frogs’
uneven harmony

alone
with dad’s old songs
another night of fireflies

adonis blue
searching in vain
among the heathcliffs

summer afternoon 
the saxophone busker
takes a drag

tornado watch
cricket songs carried
from tall grass

gypsy violin
the wheat harvest
sparkling with fireflies

mountain pass wind
whistles through my pack frame 
a pika answers

crescent moon
quiet lullaby
from the rocker

stargazer lily
a dab of pollen on the tip
of her nose

primrose 
a new nurse hired
in the playhouse

sweetfish fall downstream
how easily i slip
into yesterday

our legs
stir up phosphorescence
the heat

clouds drift
the trail of a rain drop
on a dirt covered leaf

butterfly
the thought of myself
not thinking

yard sale 
listening to sunsets
in the conch shell

slow current
the rusting shadow
of a truss bridge

peaceful evening
the drip
of oars at rest

dusk
the home plate umpire
brushes it off again

my housefly’s autumn
the window with the hills
of apple trees

moonlit waves
the glow of streetlights
on clapboard cottages

snow in the forecast 
some extra spice
in the jambalya

1201 am
flying a drunkard’s path
the year’s first moth

snow erasing
the garden’s features 
teaching my dad to shave

unilingual
i study the expressions
in a wren’s eye

first cold day
the cat kneads
a patch of sunlight

first flakes
discovering my childhood
in a box

orion’s belt
my words byte by byte
to another continent

after the funeral
snow covers
the dark places

pond shimmer
there not there
grebes

early spring
the honey pot
nearly empty

goose crossing
the old pick-up’s
broken horn

valley stillness 
a butterfly passes through
an empty log

fading stars
a hedgehog haphazards
its way back home

filtered sunlight
where the forest thins
daffodils

her gray hair
gone blonde 
first day of spring

fiddlehead fern
the way it rolls
off the tongue

sunset
flash of starlings
in the acacia

day lilies
waking to find
it wasn’t a dream

pock
of tennis balls 
the heat

summit
a gnat’s weight
on my nose

swallowtail
maybe i’ll
say yes

sagging porch
my conversation
with a stray dog

home run
moths swarm
the floodlights

longest day
rolling each awning
out to its limit

bottom of the canyon
a brochure
of spectacular views

doll house 
my daughter changes
her mind again

far from home
she puts a shell
to my ear

summer stars
an actor’s bow
sweeps the pool of light

campfire sparks 
someone outside the circle
starts another song

unfazed
by my problems
the moon

horsetail clouds 
a biker shrinks
into the open miles

rusty gate
the beaten track
of its swing

nearly spring
a new facade
for the bridal shop

daffodils 
in first grade i played the one
in jesus’ garden

small town garage
miss december
nineteen ninety

navy housing
she plants her garden
in pots

two steers
rub their heads together
morning chill

sleety rain
the flowered umbrellas
sold out

spring greening
a teat for each piglet
but one

hometown visit
an urge to go full tilt
across the speed bumps

spring dusk 
a camellia follows
the curve of the moon

traces of light 
the way back
to the stars

a bit drunk
the sea
softly crashing

a perfect circle
drawn in the sand 
my hand trembles

crescent moon
bare arms brush
evening primrose

mallards drift
into the pickerelweed
lazy afternoon

creek crossing
her hand in mine
one rock at a time

she calls
to tell us she has news
dandelion breeze

red chili pepper
i compare her calendar
with mine

letting the day take me
a sea otter
floats on its back

low tide
the metal detector
misses sunset

a bare bulb
burning in the barn 
winter fields

winter grasses
a break in our
interconnectedness

hallway light flickers 
i inch towards
the dead mouse

idling bus
the driver blows
into cupped hands

long talk
the sunny side of the street
has switched

cold ocean
moon shards leap
from waves to rocks

bedside watch
a barn owl shrieks
in the snowy spruce

winter morning
i shovel the drive twice
waiting for the hearse

deep inside
the city’s sound
winter crows

snow moon
two porch chairs
facing each other

new coolness
more neighbors know
my dog’s name

school desk
one name carved
deeper than the rest

moonlit shadows
his hands find
my dark places

no voice
but for the stones
autumn brook

hazy moon 
dad’s walking stick
knocking in the trunk

small-talk
a flock of starlings
settles on the fence

her due date
the apple at the tip
tilts the limb

corn husk dolls
she hardly remembers
the old place

central park
after a jogger
the pigeons regroup

autumn leaves
the river picks up
its pace

regrets i’ve had a few
too much apple
on the peel

colors change
telling jokes
in a foreign tongue

december sunset
the red inside
the mare’s thin coat

withering wind
a hurt with a name
i can’t pronounce

christmas dinner
the fifth burner
finally ignites

a moonlit pumpkin field
in the rearview
she fixes her makeup

all souls’ day
zombies return
to the costume shop

what’s left of my faith
light from one star
in a blue-black sky

firelight
the hiss and crackle
of an old lp

december rain
the scooter bumps
room to room

spring breeze
it’s just not the same
with open eyes

our house for sale
blossoms for apples
that won’t be mine

spring morning
balloons cover
the vendor’s face

a line borrowed
from another poet
spring rain

high clouds
the crane worker lowers
himself

a warbler
weaving the song
into blossoms

tumbleweed
kids on bikes
in hot pursuit

neap tide 
gulls grubble for clams
in the mudflats

spent shotgun shells
our legs find the rhythm
of the tracks

shades of autumn
the gleaners come
in rat-gray coats

wave after wave
the godwits leave
for siberia

sunstreams
the donkey’s neck stretches
into august barley

far away thunder
the polished rocks
in the river

spirits
on the painter’s brush 
autumn woods

sand covers
the salmon bones 
autumn begins

teeth on its catch
the rasp of an otter’s breath
autumn dusk

coat hanger rust
on his church shirt 
winter comes early

veteran’s day
it whips the way
wet flags do

a rose hip
bright in the snow
pearl harbor day

christmas eve
searching for the beginning
of the scotch tape

the red-deer herd
packed tightly together
winter sunlight

cut from driftwood
a cross stands
on the headland

the church fills
with smells of overcoats 
morning mist

her small hand in mine
we scrape a rising tone
from the metal bowl

a misty halo
around the streetlight
smoking hoodies

morning quiet
a thin skin holding
the yolk intact

school closings 
the snowmen arrive
flake by flake

the second opinion
no worse than the first
groundhog day

fat bellies
of sparrows
february’s extra day

winter sunshine
a cockroach also comes out
of the hole

late-winter twilight
he comes home
without the dog

speaking my mind
a log tumbles
out of the fire

winter night
the slow circling
of the bar rag

finches flit
through dry stems 
winter shadows

waking
into absence
late winter

a snow goose
cups its wings to land 
curve of the shore

morning yoga 
the curve of a lizard
on the wall

thunderclouds
the soft boom
of a bittern

strewn mimosa
a carnival creature
snaps at the crowd

ripened corn
i write the last line
to my thesis

a cockroach
on the welcome mat
motel dusk

anywhere sun
finds the creek
water striders

six o’clock news
i magnify the world
of a praying mantis

lunch hour 
a whisper of pigeon wings
enters the conversation

wasteland
the dandelion head
emptied of seeds

last night of summer
the old cat and i
go out with the stars

deserted trail
my heart skips a beat
over a turtle

inside pitch 
learning to pronounce
new names

morning prayers
her hopi flutes stacked
in the sunflower can

hospital window 
a fingerprint against
the summer sky

long summer
another dog
snarls at me

lily-of-the-valley
the effortless dance
of butterflies

spanish guitar 
leaf shadows flicker
on the empty floor

on vacation 
the sound of the inn
settling

exam table
my feet sway
to an old song

hole in the footbridge
i spit
straight in my face

spring melt
the susurration of water
in the tea kettle

scattered leaves
a chaplain flips the pages
of his prayer book

glacial potholes
a shrike returns
to the cholla

rainy night
the slam of his car door
brings a sigh

a row of dryers
twirling their contents
longer days

churchgoers 
ice floes drift together
at the river’s mouth

spring
an airborne squirrel
open-pawed

mother’s bruises
turning purple
holy saturday

the long eyelashes
of the easter pig 
nightfall

first warm day
the training wheels
come off

hiroshima day
multi-color threads
on the weaving machine

more footsteps 
the broken branch
breaks again

one deep breath
for a moment the pine
is part of me

summer dawn
the cat brings the rain
to bed

summer stars
hot buttered corn
on our smiles

summer brook
perfect skipping stone
on the other side

rain on summer sand
a child writes
the dead pony’s name

wet sand
the summer wind
sets our pace

peach season
friends come to visit
our tree

coffee shop 
hearing his name
in someone else’s conversation

father-in-law’s death
one gardenia petal
falls in the rain

razor wire
in the lime tree
a bird song

rolling sunset
the dark side
of a wave

the first bird
to break silence
hour of the wolf

icesnow 
the stab marks
of her pronged cane

flashlight shadows
the storyteller’s head
fills the ceiling

moonless night
the splinter deep
in my finger

deep winter
the splinter begins
to fester

rain turning to snow
a beggar in the subway
that no one believes

winter stars
we all hunt
for his belt

winter beach 
the size of gulls
up close

winter sun
the iv pouch
buckles

home village
nowhere to visit
but the graveyard

early morning
glue sets in the shade
of the old shed

early warmth
in the backyard a flicker
pokes among rocks

that dull gleam
through the hazy park 
a playhouse window

one maple leaf
end over end on the sand
without a trace

everywhere this morning
maple keys soaking in
the gentle rain

summer dawn 
light around the windows
as at grandmother’s

thump and screech 
the long freight pulls out
in robin’s song

restless pigeons 
gentle words from a clerk
bring a hint of tears

crescent moon
would i look at the clouds
without it?

how to tell
of the myriad rich browns?
pin-oak leaves

persons and place
to view the moon
sake not quite full

santoka too
passed away on this date 
wine with my tears

almost dry again
the drinking gourd

new year’s day
our neighbors’ boots
in the mud room

after all
the cell phone calls
the pine

a few heads nod
as a vision is retold
the candle’s flame

a winter sun
drawn in yellow crayon 
the children’s ward

split white birch
a beaver’s wake
reaches shore

the bent nail
where garlic hung
winter moon

winter night
my wish
still among the stars

word of a death
the clarity
of winter sunlight

mud month 
a line of fox tracks
divides the field

morning warmth
a boy stretching his step
to match dad’s

thundercloud
blue veins down to the heart
of the gentian

sunburst
bits of river
through the mangroves

a whiff of kelp
as i clear out the trunk 
summer moon

scenic outlook
each step reveals
more grasshoppers

jasmine in bloom 
termites swarm
from their nest

bark butter 
a nuthatch
works the edges

mountain slopes
getting wet as i walk
through clouds

city bus stop
the boy squats in the shadow
of his pregnant mother

so many ways
to see the world
snake in the grass

haloed moon
the hawker twirls
his glow bracelets

long road
the leaves and i
windblown

sunshine
the colors
of the hill

temple steps 
his shoes
in the autumn rain

backyard pine 
what can i do
with all these crows

his lantern’s glow
pushing back the dark
frog song

ebb tide
the heron steps
into twilight

daybreak
a migratory bird’s feather
on the path

love
a kigo for all
seasons

a memorial bell
tolls tolls and stops
but his words

blue dragonfly
pine needles cover
the narrow path

a teacher’s passing
moonlight bathes
the apple tree

another light
now 
among the stars

a gentle breeze ripples
everywhere his words
leaves on grass

opening his book
the world he offered
tumbles out

beyond emptiness
the moon filling itself
for certain

autumn evening
adding another star
to the milky way

prayer flags
the autumn leaves carry
the blessings to you

cloudy day
the janitor misses
a fallen leaf

surf murmurs
the basso continuo
behind the dunes

this fragility 
white cranes laced
in the air

insect chirps
lingering low on the ground
the later moon

heavy fog 
the mountain still back there
out of sight

what a silence!
and nobody’s around
to share it with

migrating birds 
i hear his voice in the wind
toward nirvanna

bleu roi
a thousand flying foxes
quarter moon

walking alone
the filtered sounds
of the hototogisu

dusk
a half-ripe melon
frees itself from the vine

patter of raindrops
in autumn leaves
the seasons turn

his passing
the small fir collects
fallen leaves

starry night
a worn phone number
in the handbook

goldfish
in the graveyard pond
spring sunshine

family reunion
chachalacas shake
the branches

dusk
the last calf
settles into the herd

morning rain
a handful of strawberries
just as cool

beach walk
i shift a coconut
from hand to hand

warming breeze 
the barber’s pile of clippings
a little bigger

evening traffic
rubber lizards for sale
still on the pavement

first summer rain
the bride and groom pause
in their dance

tin roof
two doves settle
into a groove

village bells
the sun-warmed odor
of cattle

dry autumn
the fading vibrance
of a spider lily

hard to tell you
how i feel
this late autumn sky

petrified forest
a stone axe echoes
in the sky

autumn ginko
one by one
into mist

harvest home
a red nasturtium
heads for the stars

a single breath
the ember
comes to life

leaving us in autumn
leaving behind him
the blossoms to come

ebbing tide
a bright shell caught
by the current

tree leaves fall
as the long journey begins
a fading hymn

white hydrangea
fading
in white light

museum dusk
mannequin soldiers
hold their ground

nest-building 
a magpie sings
with its mouth full

softly the quail
from their crowded crates
greet the dawn

april
the shadows
bloom

spring book signing
the poet’s pen
skips

plum blossoms 
vitamins strewn
across my plate

magnolia in full bloom 
a new tingling
in my breasts

angle of repose
a hermit thrush
fills the valley

songbirds in the dark
the sound of my sister’s voice
when she lies

the downpour ends
first one peep
then another

cicadas
the double dutch girls
take five

onion skins
in the kitchen sink 
leaves raked and piled

warm rain
batman rides
on daddy’s shoulders

frost melt 
the pewit
speaks its name

late november
no leaves to break the fall
of heavy rain

apples in the grass
an empty swing sways
from the branch

fallen leaves
around the maple
do i have to go home

morning chill
a child’s shadow
moves thru mine

that kind of day
the wind at my back
most of the time

almost sunset 
my husband humming a tune
of his own

breakfast alone
except for that cricket
behind the fridge

floating log
your words carry me
across the river

autumn equinox
a crow on the wire
reverses its grip

the same hilltop
but on the other side
of summer

tug horn
a cloud shadow
puts out to sea

rain on cedar shakes
after long silence
an old friend speaks

desert breeze
the clay jugs broken
by shadow

billowing clouds
the mill’s overshot wheel
dark with moss

bounding ahead
over mountain roads
the full moon

autumn wave
the hiss
of tiny pebbles

the mountain pine 
holding the light
held by it

bill’s day 
draw the letters
in aspen-glow

a little cold
and without the bright fish
this golden pond

gray october
the poet’s voice
outlives him

full moon
and so my thoughts
turn to you

vest pocket park
the leaves a little
less brilliant

at his passing 
a ripple in the river
of stars

misty shroud 
leaves falling
between the rails

sunset fades
from the highest peak 
autumn chill

higginson’s haiku
still among the living
the autumn wind

arbor gate 
turning sideways
to avoid the thorns

beach sunrise
daylight crawls
crab by crab

late summer
echo of a motorcycle
buzzing in the tunnel

butterfly house
our voices
float in whispers

vegetarian daughters
fingers stained
turmeric

heat lightning
through a stuck
screen door

oppressive heat 
tossing ice cubes
to the junk yard dog

lovers down the beach
turn out to be
driftwood

storm shelter
a girl and her mother play
itsy-bitsy spider

two caterpillars
crossing paths 
summer’s end

morning sun
cherry petals drying
on a turtle’s back

young green poplars
recalling
that kind of intensity

roadside huddle
of thatched roof huts
earthy rain scent

the sweet peas
begin their climb
solstice

wild roses
the farm wife shears
a gravid ewe

first warm day
harleys gleam
the length of the diner

budding maples 
an updraft
of goldfinches

manhattan skyline
my son is getting married
tonight

weeds uprooted
the earth
under my fingernails

mountain overlook
a rush of perfume
from the seniors’ tour bus

morning frost
a monk’s chant
crosses the river

stalagmites
a passel of school children
up ahead

autumn leaves
in the book she gave me
an old library stamp

autumn gust
the starlings’ wings
tilt in unison

withered juniper 
mother’s hair
since the nursing home

village temple 
kids behind the gods
playing hide and seek

through endless rain
the whistle
of the paperboy

the taste of cider
when fallen leaves begin
to overlap

bustling shoppers 
the bell ringer’s
prosthetic hand

winter solstice
smoothing a folded corner
in my library book

a single bubble
after the beaver dives
the rising moon

the gardener
and his scarecrow
the same hat

crows swagger
down the middle of the road
summer’s end

starting school tomorrow 
he talks to trees
at the woods’ edge

labor day
a spot of barbecue sauce
on the face of my watch

summer’s end
two flies fighting
over me

old blue car 
the ease
of summer’s last days

a still starry night 
train tracks
wet with dew

scudding clouds
the snake as long
as my sleeve

stump speech 
this black and white butterfly
in none of the field guides

indian summer
a turtle on a turtle
on a rock

autumn afternoon
a shaft of light
ends in moss

chance of rain
the dove selects rejects selects
a twig

faint thunder
a snake sloughs its skin
in the creekbed

canyon echo
sky-colored asters
among the rocks

hospice terrace
the gardener disturbs
winter dust

pan-fried trout
i learn something new
about my father

closing time
winter dusk slides down
the book drop

summer
the sound of rain
on canvas

cherry buds
so much effort
to be nice

prom day 
on my daughter’s waist
a boy’s hand

village in the mountains
a stray dog becomes
our trek guide

baptism song
a turtle slips
into the river

yard sale
a family portrait
bought for its frame

just how
to hold you
paper kite

willow
the limits
of happiness

towing
a rainbow
baby duck

pool filter
a child’s collection
of dandelion wishes

beach cottage
the musty smell
of old novels

last moon of summer
the bottom falls out
of the pitch

cicada shell
the space behind
its eyes

moon
the light in the shade
of an unlit lamp

old growth mountain
two red dragonflies couple
and uncouple

full moon
the silence of birds
expanding

the hand that touches mine
from tree to tree
the path of wind

wind turbines
grind the sunset
summer’s end

well-trodden rut
a line of heifers
watch me pass

they speak
of my doppelgänger
autumn’s first chill

indian summer 
a black bear grazes
the shriveled berries

dark lagoon
a thousand years
of tree frogs

the crows
choose headstones
july heat

fireworks 
her handprint evaporates
from the cold glass

hydrangea 
over tea mulling the idea
of utopia

rain forecast
spittlebugs at the nodes
in meadow grass

between two farms
one of barley one of wheat
the old battlefield

windless day
one ripe tomato drops
from the vine

brilliant moon 
sharp shadows of lemons
on the stone steps

a dry riverbed
cloud shadows moving
down the canyon

in ten summers
the convict’s first visit
dragonfly

turning leaves
he flips a penny
into the sun

a medevac helicopter
passes low 
scent of autumn leaves

fading light
pink-footed geese wade
into the sun

chimney smoke
the long straight rows
of cornfield stubble

a lullaby
turning to whisper
moonrise

two dragonflies
riding the screen door
autumn deepens

ghost of
a white gazebo
night rain

counting the lines
on my neck 
magpie song

cornflakes
soaked with milk
all the leaves have fallen

mallet to chisel
chisel to stone
the north wind

adjoining properties 
the cut
of the mower blade

afternoon tea
my mother
speaks her history

white butterfly
i’m also ready
to surrender

hayshed
the old iron roof
straining daylight

telephoto lens
the loon’s call
comes into focus

summer commute
again a truckload
of crushed cars

trail signs 
pausing
to find myself

her eyes
say yes
fireflies

reflecting pool
she tosses coins in
without looking

lake of stars
the taste
of polaris

the old moon
everyone else
i’ve outlived

back to school
unlearning
the whole summer

the way
it feels to hold you
gibbous moon

still reflecting
upon creation
dragonfly eye

manna gumtrees
the sugar glider’s belly
before the moon

chalk line
the screech
of infinity

schoolyard fence 
when did i end up
on this side?

a berry’s curve
in a crow’s beak
harvest moon

autumn sky
the paint worn thin
around the birdhouse door

watching the deer
watch my morning train
pass by

spring
whistling through
a blade of grass

mild weather
their argument continues
outside

war veteran
lobbing grain
at his hens

blue rain
a kayak frozen
in the slipstream

pool drain
the frogs
i couldn’t save

town gossip 
a rototiller’s blade
turning up stones

army hospital
he finger-spells
i love you

buttercup meadow
a blackbird rises
at the twig’s snap

recession 
poke salad growing
in a sidewalk crack

remembering
a maya’s feather
in dawn light

you are here
the crisscross
of snow flurries

newly-fallen snow
the warmth
in a hare’s paw

shortest day of the year
a peculiar voice
from each appliance

her last words
snow falling
on beech leaves

thirty below zero
losing my faith
in turtles

morning moon
a peregrine
begins its dive

mouse
the sound
is enough

soft moonlight
a second owl
answers

wings of grass
what remains
of her snow angel

streaming towards
the winter sunset
crematorium smoke

faces put on
at the family gathering 
watermelon rinds

pasture tree
its shade
shapes the herd

lonely is a place
inside
the call of a loon

bomb shelter 
my old belongings
huddle in the dark

night sky
our long look at
the past

sunrise
the full arc
of sprinklers

foxglove
a hummingbird adjusts
the breeze

concrete 
the jungle
within me

cold overnight
no way of knowing
where the loon will surface

the night’s crickets
never silent
never seen

the almost
of crabapple buds
hazy sky

i will not leave 
apple blossoms collect
on my shoulders

incense for remembrance
water trickles down
the mountain side

matching exhales
with the sleeping dog
bone colored mist

soapsuds 
mother tells me how
she’d like to die

construction site
yellow ribbons
outline the future

puddle
in the umbrella
morning sun

childless
i measure time
by how the willow grows

easter fog lifting
a blowfly rises
from roadkill

cemetery bees
her last diploma
made of marble

home for christmas
the tree losing needles
on fake snow

as i turn the page
napoleon leaves moscow
fading winter light

year’s first moon
the widow turns
her mattress

winter night 
i dream
in monochrome

finally good news 
the reflection of my face
inside a tea bubble

dumpster
the iridescence
of starlings

snowy night
drinking tea
from my hometown

over old ground
a dunnock’s search
in winter shrubs

low tide
gull and gannet shadows
pick shells

spring peepers
raindrops stipple the creek
in chorus

cradling her belly 
waiting for someone who
is already here

autumn 
i count once again
tulip bulbs in the bag

the bus is late
across the twilight river
the wheeling starlings

another morning
of mares tails
the wisp of a sigh

different carols
two drifters singing
for spare change

indian summer
the soccer net ripples
with a goal

remembering to let them
speak first
cosmos in the rain

change of seasons
i catch myself talking
to the wind

waiting room
someone whispers
be morning soon

an inchworm
grasping thin air
christmas morning

thump and screech
the long freight pulls out
in robin's song

standing waves
the tide's quiet way
up river

cloudy day
the fallen purple petals
of the azalea

a fox's ears
above the garden wall
autumn sun

kindling pile
mother retrieves the stick
engraved by beetles

winter blues
half the piano keys
in sunlight

blackened forest
a mushroom
gnawed white

a small bowl
of imported oranges
snow outside

winter sky
we decide to take
the slower road

spring fog
a shoulder of mountain
crooked with pines

alleluias
a trapped bird flutters about
the church

dawn
between branches the night
fades into sky

snowbound
the orange tip
of a traffic cone

parting clouds
a crack in the ice
follows the riverbend

religion aside
there are plum blossoms
and pussywillows

twilit tombstone
an owl
drops a pellet

departing hearse
the coldness as a wheelchair
touches my leg

slight ripple
a moon spindles out
into others

winter beach
the skywriting drifts
into clouds

distant glimmer
of a beach fire
autumn moonrise

thick fog
the sound of raven wings
between firs

traffic tie-up
a fisherman on the bridge
casts a long line

waiting
a leaf falls
into my lap

moon shadows
between screams
the baby yawns

open casket
the absence
of his cologne

loneliness
a hint of salt
in the rain

needle-cushioned path
only when he hops
the red toad

maine
granite poking up
through the lawn

slight arc
of the stepping stones
summer moon

spring rain
dad's name misspelled
in the obituary

mountain air
a caterpillar reaches
the twig's end

warm rain
in the center of the tree stump
a black hole

tiring heat
the newspaper story continues
on another page

first blossoms
the heron's nest
out on a limb

dawn light
on white camellias
the fever breaks

white plum blossoms
mother-of-pearl on the korean chest
gathers the dawn

the kite
caught by a tree
still flying

spring breeze
one raindrop nudged
into another

melting snow
i know why
the caged bird sings

a single bark
from below the village
mist rising

morning breeze
a butterfly sways
with the blossom

stained glass sunray
into the chalice
the creaking of knees

thorn-tree fence
even shadows seldom
come inside

gloves of fishermen
hanging on a clothesline
shadows of gloves

summer's end
the staggered heights
of black umbrellas

a pause in the rain
the old man goes out
to check the mailbox

4h fair
such a long-handled brush
to lather the pig

faded sale sign
a sailboat heeled over
in the tall weeds

restoring a fresco
light changes
along the grand canal

blinding rain
i find an old love's name
in the obituaries

dense fog
the pine smudged
into shadow

milky way 
maybe tonight
i’ll conceive

twinkling stars
again we pass the house
we’ll never buy

wounded knee 
trying not to speak
above the wind

gooseflesh
in the cold grass
crickets

her death bed
the clackety-clack-clack
of my homebound train

he tells me the word
i’m looking for
total eclipse

late autumn
a doll that lost
its sawdust

guttering candle
a whole life lived without
the northern lights

falling leaves
the knot that makes
two lines one

wetting fingers
to pick up crumbs
insomnia

a carpet of leaves
i try to remember
her first smile

fallow field
the frosted shadow
of a scarecrow

christmas eve 
candles flicker through
our wine glasses

summer’s end
the familiar scent
of the old salt cedar

a hummingbird
follows the falling leaf
my friend’s untimely death

paper lanterns
a white eggplant glows
beneath withered leaves

simmering rice grains
in the pot 
patter of rain

the cricket
stuck in a minor key 
milky way

morning glory
still some openings
i haven’t seen

9 11 moment of silence
the clicks
of a thousand cameras

the only cafe
surrounded by trucks
harvest moon

salt marsh
the runnels deepen
through cordgrass

from one skyscraper
to the next
emerging moon

cicadas buzz
as we walk from the church
white dresses

lightning strike
the majestic poplar’s
creamy heartwood

ashes of roses 
what once was our secret
now just mine

mountain top 
the photograph of the view
before the view

the big empty 
half grass
half sky

trail dust
all those years mother hiked
behind us

heat lightning
a skunk’s scent
wets the night air

late summer
waking to the vacant o
of the wren’s house

faded roses
some of the words
i can’t take back

summer twilight 
the red ball runs
the final wicket

melting bitumen
the beetle and i
reduced to a crawl

smell of grass
a drop of sweat sizzles
on the mower

the smile
in his voice
starshine

listening to the sound
from the deep well
stone on stone

poplar seeds
all my dreams
coming true

long afternoon
here and there
a butterfly’s shadow

deodorant scent
tonight love
i am a spring wind

thistledown
drifting toward its shadow
my friend’s last day

roots down deep
mud paddies bake
in the midday sun

summer dusk 
watering the garden
then my feet

morning fog
on the coastal route
wild mustard

dragonfly pair
female so clear
through his wings

dusk
with nowhere to turn
sunflower

midnight bus
the door swings open
to moonlight

single track
coal cars
beat out a tune

shrinking shade
a praying mantis rocks
in the warm breeze

smell of sedge
coots settling
in the reeds

late moon halo
fish scales reflecting
on my father’s blade

the hound’s tail matches
the turn signal’s beat
almost home

whistling to myself 
the changing rhythms
of marsh grass

temperature drop 
the way stars are
a witness

swollen moon 
the sudden urge
to push

the fire’s scent
lingering
morning moon

cold snap
waking to the creak
of house timbers

clatter of pipes
when i turn the tap off
snowy night

a hawk’s cry
i listen
to the gathering dark

how strange this human body
not queen anne’s lace
not thistle

frigid morning
the brittle echo
of a crow

winter evening
my boy calls
to say he’s feeling better

an ancient wick
casts shadows on the wall 
mother’s soft humming

in the tide mark
a child’s blue jacket
gull’s cry

low tide
waiting for grandchildren
to happen

azalea bonsai 
the flower girl clutches
her first bouquet

honeysuckle
the hummingbird
presses in deeper

early summer
boys throw father’s lures
into moonlight

sea anemone
the baby’s firm grip
on my finger

first birthday
she reaches
for the flame

summer rain
the red earth
reddens

sheet lightning
a gray cat flickers
through the grass

three-day beard
a large rock
divides the river

mountain retreat 
a layer of dust
on all the canned goods

green-black sheen
of a rooster’s tail feathers
my neighbor’s new car

closing light
the whistles of siskins
in the fringes of the wood

dead end street
bougainvillea overflows
the chain link fence

broken screen 
the house finch
looks in

at the entrance
to the whistle-pig’s burrow
mountain bluebells

when you think
you’ve heard it all 
brown thrasher

we both squeeze
through the kissing gate
thunderclap

desert wind
a wire fence stretches
to nowhere

dry spell
the dust of sparrows
blown by the wind

an empty shot glass
on the windowsill
evening snow

heavy going
through the waterlogged field
clay-pigeon shards

a rainy slope
where legions fell
thistles

wild mint
in the spring forest
a chance encounter

rocky shore
the trout on my line
pulls you closer

cabin fever
bullrushes bursting
in the vase

shredded checks 
the robin weaves my life
into its nest

warm breeze 
new ivy leaves finding
their place in the sun

spring moon
from the street girl’s hand
a shadow rabbit

crabapple blossom 
the older twin always
one step behind

pedal boat
i overtake
a duck

rainbow
his sketch stippled
with droplets

330 am
a single layer
of birdsong

tempers flare
the x-mark on the back
of a stinkbug

venus and jupiter
the barechested fire-eater
taunts his crowd

an arc of ibis
above the harbor
blue sky day

summer dusk
a little milk
left in his glass

squad car
at the neighbors’ again
distant thunder

every word
breaking something
hailstones

dirt road 
a buddha sticker
on the stop sign

ancient fir scar 
a banana slug pulls one eye
inward

blackberry stains
on the white sidewalk
his urgent kiss

late summer talk 
the oil lamp smoke
going in circles

sunset
the fishing boats closer
to each other

cracked boulder
an acorn
settles in

shelling almonds
bits and pieces of
childhood

lolita on the hammock
floating back to its branch
a butterfly

end of summer
the sting of a thorn
through my garden glove

essays to grade
a car stirs dust
on the gravel road

cattail seed
floating  the places
i would go

icy cobblestones 
the tinsmith
stokes the forge

tangled
in blades of grass
spring breeze

i ask him again
the honeybee burrows
into thistle

home game
our wind
in their flag

lowered
on lark-song
his coffin

orange nasturtiums
the stir of life
in my womb

fog blurring the hills 
to pass the time
we reminisce

high autumn sky
i return a greeting
from the dog

dusting over
dad’s bowl of wheat pennies
late autumn light

you have
no voicemail messages
winter wind

we talk
most of the rose petals
on the table

the barnacled flukes
of migrating whales
mountains lost in haze

far below
migrating geese
follow the river

parting year
someone has died in the house
with the shoveled walk

all that sound
from a single sparrow 
winter morning

morning rain
secondhand smoke
in an apology

family album
the black and white
of my youth

evening haze
the sound of one duck
flapping

aimlessly floating by
it carries off the summer
yellow leaf

low sun
behind the churchyard
piles of earth

early dusk
an obituary taped
in a used book

full moon
the sidewalk curves
around tree roots

its whole body
cawing
the crow

a dried leaf
slips from her journal
new year's eve

borrowed novel
a bookmark left
near the end

seance
a white moth flutters
above our clasped hands

all souls' eve
limbs of the sycamore
through the fog

fading light
the faint smell of camphor
on old love letters

twenty below
the milky way
lined up with the river

cutting
the red bell pepper
cathedral chambers

fireworks
i close my eyes
for a second look

porch breeze
a fluff of puppy hair
into the pea hulls

the eyes
of a scarecrow
harvest lightning

squatter camp
the witchdoctor's bones rattle
with a passing train

camping out
the flashlight beam
lost among stars

dawn
the first sunflower
rises over the fence

dawn breeze
a song of migrants
from the potato field

old beehives
in the weeds at the crossing
a rumbling freight

empty tracks
a stranger and i
looking in the same direction

chain-link fences
the snowstorm melting
where it fell

root cellar
white sprouts reach for
the slit of light

wrapping tulips
her fingertips smudged
with yesterday's news

at odds today
crow-pecked plums
in the leafy tree

one year gone
crushed rose petals on the soles
of his garden boots

sunday morning
a boy digs in the mud
that buried a cathedral

old garden shed
clumps of dirt
shaped like pots

the jockey's silks
the yellow of a swallowtail
i place my bet

soft rain
a frog leaps from
one leaf to another

start of a journey
petals stuck
in the tire treads

driving past wheatfields
snippets of meadowlark song
from the fence posts

narrow bridge
our shadows fall
onto the rocks

hazy sky
the sound of the anchor
lowering

dusk
pelicans and cormorants
share the rocks

searing heat
a passing bus stirs
the first row of cotton

crossing the bridge
the shadow of a gull
i never see

right now
while we chat
fish in the deep ocean

empty deck
the seagull adjusts
its glide

tiny seashells
under the magnifying glass
a cut finger

summer twilight
the flap of pigeons
in a dry fountain

for the fragrance
brushing tomato leaves
warm august sun

studio window
a fly walks
from cloud to cloud

summer heat
the sticky touch
of blue-eyed grass

the warbler
in a mockingbird's song
summer dusk

late-summer party
her few dance steps
after the song ends

the sun's warmth
part of the house
we seldom use

a hawk rising
between canyon walls
layers of heat

bird bath
miles of sky
reflected

a circle of teens
playing hacky sack
summer twilight

september morning
the teacher writes her name
on the blackboard

dragonfly
the tai chi master
shifts his stance

open windows
the sound of a distant train
on a sleepless night

in-laws visit
a red dragonfly lands
in the white lily

low tide 
stones that have dried
among those that haven’t

winter dusk
the bare shoulders
of the prostitute

starry night
a doe’s breath
frozen on her fawn

one seed
at a time
winter finch

the slant of sleet 
redwings riding
withered reeds

afternoon moon
puddles on the ice
about to freeze

tree-swaying wind
echoes in the air ducts
the afghan grows

dense snowfall
the different stories
of father’s youth

morning rush hour 
my ankles wrapped
with yellow leaves

call from the hospital
a leaf caught in my wiper
leaves a streak

funeral over
people and leaves scatter
in the wind

winter afternoon
finding the needle
with my finger

faded totem pole 
the frog’s mouth
filled with snow

the hambone
sticks out from the soup
last geese

year’s end 
the median strip vanishes
into a curve

wolves gnawing
at my dream
singing bowls

new year’s morning 
the circles
of a toy train

winter doldrums 
my own footprints lead me
into the woods

december seventh
from the ship’s bell
icicles

year’s end
well-worn pages
of the psalms

awake at dawn 
a snow mantle muffles
the cock’s crow

sitting alone
how slowly the
icicles melt

one mallard
drifts on the satin lake
my mind smooths out

thunder 
the plover lower
on her eggs

a molting peacock
settled on the gatepost 
dog days

train delay 
all the ripe blackberries
beyond reach

stepping stones
across a swollen stream 
the milky way

flowers for his grave
the morning moon
a full circle

garden clearout
snails cling
to the wheelbarrow

dreary day 
my neighbor takes down
the hummingbird feeder

starry starry night 
unfinished art school paintings
in the dumpster

row of silver oaks
the first touch of frost
in my hair

rising mist
a heron breaks
the surface calm

power failure
the mockingbird
keeps on singing

early spring warmth 
the cleaning lady shows me
her first tattoo

bonsai hall
we lower
our voices

quiet morning
the garden snails nibble
young radishes

kingfisher
a scent of willow hangs
in the air

morning haze
at the foot of the hill
forsythia

glass harmonica 
a chickadee listens
from the windowsill

conversation over
i touch a petal
real blossoms

our boat drifts
under the bridge
nesting cormorants

a willowtip
touches the water
sun-rings

cold evening 
the smell of chili beans
and cornbread

winter night 
the moon absorbed
by her nightgown

moonlit beach
the white teeth
on a cowrie shell

fresh breeze 
the weathervane turning
with the gulls

butchering a rabbit
cold rain
on my hat

snow after shakespeare
a child asks
is it true?

slowly she brushes
her long black hair
snow still falling

valentine’s day
eiders displaying
just offshore

your letter
all of the bananas
too green to eat

eviction notice 
a moth ricochets
in the lampshade

a killdeer pretends
her wing is broken
the smell of cut hay

summer day
a census taker pushes
the rusty bell

the slight hesitation
before our sails fill
summer's end

river gravel
the stone
i once skipped

freeway drizzle
he helps his only daughter
move out

october sunset
the glow of tomatoes
on the sill

the mugo pine
gathers maple leaves
my husband chose me

sweater weather
the tip of a cane
in the crosswalk

gibbous moon
a paper cut
from don quixote

awakening
to the fly-off shuffle
of pigeons from the roof

a grackle
in every tree
random thoughts

train rails
lead away from here 
autumn wind

not as funny
as it sounds
dead duck

strangler fig
the cooling shade
around me

and night garden
all the births and deaths
that will go unrecorded

virgin forest 
moonlight sinks into earth
with my pee

least bittern
i hold the paddle tight
against the current

our passing breeze 
a do not disturb sign swings
on the hotel door

summer dusk
a white flag waves
from the tree house

dying embers 
a few new twists
in an old ghost tale

what we don't speak of 
the rain-soaked gate
swollen shut

releasing him
the bull trout's back
scarred by talons

drifted sand
over campfire ash 
summer's end

paddy fields
a heron glides past
bent backs of women

the hills stir
with unmown hay
summer dusk

faraway voices
fishing nets thrown
in the spotlight

village pool
children beat sunlight
into stars

the attic
my short-lived dreams
under the ceiling fan

road just paved 
a cucumber picker hoists
the wooden crate

starry night
my child makes
more than one wish

solar eclipse
the cat aroused
by settling birds

sandcastle
my child in
his own world

no longer lovers
the rosebush you gave me
has bloomed at last

cold snap
the scent of garlic clings
to his meat grinder

year's end
clouds carrying off
scraps of moonlight

tracks
of the pallbearers
winter dusk

unlabeled shapes
from the back of the freezer
winter stars

daylight moon 
the pregnant moose
settles into snow

candlelight 
the room shrinks and grows
with every breath

closed casket
the funeral director's
peppermint breath

winter stars
the fishing holes
left behind

deep winter
the old cat squeezes
between us

winter's end
a smell of curry
in the old people's home

frosted grass
the new calves
butt heads

first day of spring
the murmuring pulse
of raven wings

coin in the mud
sinking deeper 
heads and tails

window warmth
flies that came in yesterday
want out

softly raining
this planet has so many
mouths so many teeth

skies softening
the pond ice
breaks from shore

spring flood
the ache
of old loves

barn swallows
pop leaves the door
open a crack

rope marks
on the mustang's neck
spring wind

after the rain
smell
of childhood

another mother
calling her child too 
the dark of the wind

crescent moon 
the cat grooms
the tip of his tail

first spring day 
picking up
a warm stone

into the teeth
of a cherry petal wind
sparrows

a tangled nest
of fishing line
spring birdsong

stern wind
the branch an osprey
adds to its nest

the kittens
can't yet see us
spring night

overflowing mailbox
arm deep
in forsythia

steppingstones
in the pond
tadpoles

muddy pond
i play the role of a ghost
to fish

hot night
an odor widens
her nostrils

dog days
the ice cream jingle
a four-measure loop

the close of day 
only a peg and a finch
left on the line

low in the west
under the belly of a dog
the setting sun

summer pond
no more room
for the blue sky

day moon
the street vendor's arms
gleaming with bangles

hearing it first
through the dog
distant thunder

evening moon 
the last bale of hay
ascends the conveyor

may sky 
from head to tail
the cardinal's vibrato

a fisherman
on my weeping rock
azaleas in bloom

buttercups dot
the downland pasture 
capering rabbits

bee season
she asks me to listen
to her fruit trees

summer rain 
the potted plants
push against the glass

lilacs at dusk 
ready or not
here i come

field of dandelions
thousands of wishes
going unused

billabong splash
the next turtle climbs
to the snag's tip

slicing papaya 
the swing
of her black pearls

on her cheek
an eyelash darker
than her own

a baby's lost sock
soaking up the dew
dandelion spheres

meandering stream
clydesdales rest their heads
on each other's rumps

worlds apart 
two river-worn pebbles
in my palm

graduation packed
a door is open
to the cooling world

cornflowers
brighten the kitchen
my mother's eyes

hot blue sky
lamb's blood
on the rook's tongue

our cab ride
one love song longandnbsp
spring moon

young daughters
whisper in the gallery
statue of zeus

rain-pocked dust
the shell of a snail
not yet hard

cooling the air
trees in a village
sketched by cezanne

dried apricots
a comfortable silence
between us

the worn away paint
of canted boats
geese winging in

aubergine clouds
a peacock's shriek
deepens the gloom

skillet rust
stains the sink
whirling leaves

overcast day
how does it go
that song about love

beach stones
the weathered softness
of old jeans

autumn air
the diminishing trail
of voices

steady downpour
a forever stamp
on the condolence card

autumn rain
buttoning the thirty-six
pearls on her gown

fog in the valley
the cd she gave me
stutters

gray light
of the coming rain
a raven's cry

life alone
licking
the ladle

the full moon
above a field of snow
staying up a while

deep winter
the sound of mail dropping
through the slot

long winter
my wife slows her pace
to mine

she shows me
the first snow
a finger on her lips

coffee to go
a dusting of sugar
in with my change

crow caws
a flow of sap
from the maple trees

long thaw
porridge putters
in a pan

almost spring
the lace of my running shoe
trips me again

longest day
children fishing
for ant lions

black clouds
the rain barrel still full
of cobwebs

shy girl
first to notice
the hummingbird's tongue

clear-cut forest
the way
no longer the way

monsoon wind
that touch of dust
on the rain scent

summer morning
a butterfly floats through
the teashop door

mojave sunrise
a splinter swells
my fingertip

shirts versus skins
a vulture spirals
into the sky

historic tour 
the guide points out buildings
no longer there

winter stars
who else sits up
with a sick child?

crackling beach fire 
we hum in place of words
we can’t recall

flooded plain 
fence tops show which water
belongs to whom

autumn morning 
a retiree watches
the one-way cars

war memorial
they have stopped
cutting the grass

crescent moon
would i look at the clouds
without it?

no hesitation
after the storm
cicadas

flapping from the pond
a v takes shape
twilight chill

sunday paper
a night’s drift of leaves
against the stoop

windless
the echo
of twenty-one guns

autumn rain 
she places his flowers
in the second-best vase

fog rising 
mushrooms push aside
a bed of pine needles

the softest who
a flutter in the chimney
sends down soot

new coolness
a bend of current
around the sea buoy

lonely walk
looking for the sun
for my shadow

a purple haze
across the hairgrass 
scent of her perfume

autumn equinox
my mother’s writing
on yellowed paper

the monarch butterfly
spirals in an updraft
my loneliness

a pile of clams
far from shore 
summer’s end

summer’s end
returning home
to shadows

lovers’ moon
the first godwits
settle in

smoking break
out by the dumpster
crickets mate

a slow wasp 
the lamb on the spit
makes another turn

year’s end
the bartender
blocks my reflection

winter day 
too tired to make the clouds
anything but clouds

first blossoms
a breeze shifts something
in each room

robins outside
the piano tuner
works on middle c

cycling uphill 
the butterfly
passes me

chemotherapy
her children’s names
tattooed on her shoulder

doe and yearling
fade into the woods
hepatica in bloom

spring morning
the children’s game
of being quiet

sunny morning 
his basket full
of spinning pinwheels

cherry blossom hill
children coming down
where there is no path

a killing frost 
everything i couldn’t write
about chrysanthemums

out of work 
the silverberry hedge
in a growth spurt

cracked sidewalk
a young maple
branches out

fall breeze
a wasp struggles
with the screen door

jays at the feeder
i remember the names
of high school bullies

fallen apple 
the bruise from the earth
cut off

deep autumn
a fish slides down
the cormorant’s throat

autumn rain
settled
in my ways

a path opens
through the pigeons 
wet maple leaves

all its leaves fallen 
a tree we were
forbidden to climb

warm afternoon
my daughter’s eyes close
as i read

sweet nothings
a feeding swallow turns
into last light

lingering heat
a long line of freight cars
grinds to a halt

graveside
the seeing-eye dog
looks upwind

her small son struggles
with the cemetery tap
summer grass

slow moving clouds
we plan our future
grandchildren

rumble of thunder
a street juggler
lights his torches

gridlock 
the blind girl whispers
to her dog

small town 
no fence around
the cemetery

rings on a stump 
an inch
for my life

my lungs fill
with alpine air
wanting to yodel

day’s end
the length of my fish
the length of my father’s fish

veterans’ home
with his left-handed hook
a paper swan

an old love song 
mother slices
homegrown tomatoes

first day of school
the teacher
wears purple socks

solar eclipse
the valley fills with
howls

moonless night 
from the harvested field
the hoot of an owl

billowing curtains 
an unexpected memory
of grandma’s parakeet

summer’s end
last of the blackberries
behind a web

fall colors 
my youngest son’s
deep voice

the heat
two boys take it
outside

letter from iraq
a birdsong spelled
phonetically

pear blossoms
the farmer's wife
selects a chicken

moonless night
the first click
of a shark reel

fragments of a dream 
starfish left behind
by the flood

seabirds
the wind lifts
my daughter’s hair

a greengrocer
lays out her bok choy
scales of the dragon

fading light
a small boy hurls rocks
at the surf

ocean sunrise 
we flip shells
with our toes

ocean swells
cows on a headland
noses illuminated

ocean’s roar 
all the beachgoers
on their backs

funeral
i still remember
my first swim

wild pond
step by step a turtle
meets the heat

mother’s day
the clown paints sequined kisses
on her cheek

rotting cabbage 
a slum child watches clouds
drift away

cobwebs 
the smile on
buddha’s face

overnight rain 
the scent of orange blossoms
in a desert town

backpacking trip
finding myself
without a mirror

signs in braille
name the scents 
herb garden

boyhood summer 
the hang time
of watermelon seeds

storm warning
the watercolorist works
in shades of gray

highway work 
a marmot whistles
at the crew

delicate nest 
if only paper wasps
were fireflies

great blue heron
but the stillness
after love

midnight
at the railway crossing
last kiss of summer

early morning
the spent lily
falls apart

family photo
the barn
needs a coat of paint

forever diminishing
our view of the sunset
the loss of the pine

night rain
no space
between us

moonlight
the white peonies
all to myself

hands in prayer
the carpenter has one
shorter finger

autumn clouds
a dove keeps calling
lou’s dead dead dead

dusk
a leaf’s long fall
through cicada cries

spring equinox
a summons
for jury duty

blackbird song
the old cat retches
on the threshold

my finger draws
a furrow in the loam 
unlabeled seeds

eastertide
passing fields
of numbered lambs

spring evening
the mouse comes up
through the floorboards

dents in damp grass
from the mower’s wheels

blossom rain

in the retirement home

spring wind
he pedals
faster

turning the page
to birdsong

whispers
of ancient water-song
the red planet

this flat rock
grows uncomfortable

around herself

snow melt
the tiny dot
of a mountain goat

morning pitch
of my grandmother’s voice
spring wind

mountain stream
the steady flow
of autumn leaves

daylight savings 
moon spiders stride
across the lagoon

morning stillness
pianoblack reflecting
parrotgreen

plum blossoms
my dog follows
a different scent

swift clouds
wind in the cup
of my hand

faint stars
the cabby speaks
of home

bed of spring moss 
she tosses her hair
over his shoulder

there must be light
where they come from 
chestnut blossoms

hot as blazes
a sinkful
of cat

beside my car
the morning sun rolling
along the wall of corn

cicadas
none of the sawn boards
even in length

fistful of sand
the milky way stretching
to where my wife lives

september sunset
cows come single file
through the pasture gate

bookmobile day 
huckleberries bloom
along the white picket fence

hiking the ridge 
trail dust settles
on tree tops

changing wind
tarpon bones
in the surf

a conference badge
on the bomb-sniffing dog
another september

alone tonight
light on my bedroom wall
from the neighbor’s house

dry leaves
on the trampoline
the foster child’s fifth placement

indian summer
a bee bounces around
in the beer can

a teacup
held with both hands
october gale

chill wind
a crow drinks
from the rain-filled stump

steel towers
webbing earth and sky 
the glow from mars

autumn equinox
making a new arrangement
out of the old

autumn campgrounds 
lysol from the men’s room
in the breeze

autumn chill 
a butterfly swept up
with the leaves

black ice 
the crossing guard’s sneeze
goes unblessed

temple at night
the flickering shadows
of gods and goddesses

hunter’s moon
wind in silver waves
through the beach grass

shouting couple
wave after wave nears
the seawall

a load of salt hay 
tucking in the roses
for the long sleep

she keeps speaking
into the stillness
autumn stars

long shadows
many places
to cross the creek

steel gray sea
an old woman cuts kelp
from the rocks

still water 
the grebes rise
breast to breast

open hospice door
a path of moonlight
across the sea

giving sound
to my creaky steps
old plank

scrimmage 
the wide receiver catches
rain

evening fog
we walk home by the light
of burning leaves

my eyebrows
grown longer 
winter night

winter stars
wondering what inspired
the abacus

christmas morning
a yellow ribbon
of sun

birch shadows
lace the snow-covered courtyard
a burst of wrensong

a puppet taken
from the toyshop window
winter rain

lighted window
the cat peeps in
through frost patterns

bitter cold
the bell ringer 
peppermint breath

resting his head
on her warm flank 
morning milking

subway graffiti
about someone’s mother 
hunger moon

just you and me
awake all night
bullfrog

street of rain 
the list of errands folded
smaller

poems by rilke
all morning the drifting
of pine pollen

a purple tree
when did i stop
being young?

day moon
a child feigning sleep
in the hammock

quiet rain
garden gate held open
with a hoe

floating clouds 
fragments of a conversation
across the lake

children playing 
soap bubbles burst
in the fir needles

sunny day
losing all sense
of my stone pillow

carefully tended roses
he dozes in the swing
she always loved

the conjoined
wake of two swans
spring equinox

barely legible
a vintage love
carved in oak

watery screen
a moment to remember
my pin number

out of the fog
the mystery
of a gull's wing

first blossom
our paper boat
takes its chances

crabapple petals
on the tennis court
love all

first garden
she checks for sprouts
every hour

orchid show
the heady scent
of an also-ran

mud wasps
the soft crumble
of time

evening wine
magnolias fill
with rain

first calligraphy
the astronaut's ink brush
floats away

high chaparral
a song
only the wind knows

snow follows snow
the way a raven moves
over the mountain

february's extra day
the pitcher's mound
an island in the snow

a hickory leaf
vibrating with each drop
first winter rain

sputter
of a scooter
cusp of spring

suicide forest
empty shoes
point west

war-torn land
goats lead
shepherd home

a deeper blue
the sky
after chemo

soldiers' graves
below ground-cover plants
the same questions

cold snap
a log-truck driver
tightens the chains

present perfect
crow
sheening a pause

morning coffee
black cows
slick with rain

leaky roof
a raindrop falls
into my dream

slight breeze
clothespins hold
a training bra

muddy trail
every now and then
a peanut shell

herb garden stroll
from scent to scent
i follow the leash

sitting
in the blue hour
drawing inspiration

in my rear-view mirror
the green where the city
hasn't grown

one more wave
my toes curl tighter
around nothing

migrant workers
the bruise-purple perfection
of roadside cherries

summer deepens
the ebb and flow
of porch-swing gossip

unpruned roses
more butterflies
than i deserve

midday sun
the steady ticking of
gorse seedpods

tractor parade
from a truck window the boots
of a napping cowboy

dogs
sleeping on the porch
after the war

still river
ripples from a watersnake
touch the shore

trailing clouds
the bush track gouged
with rivulets

fresh lava flow
heat waves wobble
the horizon

autumn heat
marigold musk
anoints my hands

the dream
my father still clings to
backyard sailboat

the cat
with many homes
gibbous moon

on days like this
he used to feed apples to deer
rust on our shared fence

drifting
right across the afternoon
thistledown

autumn lake
i'd forgotten
touch-me-nots

autumn nightfall
a strong case for both moonlight
and sharp teeth

night silence
in a house gecko's mouth
the cricket

somewhere
between bitter and sweet
migrating geese

wet earth
a hen bares termites
to its chicks

slowing train
the stare of a bullock
standing in a stream

sultry night
she proposes a slice
of key lime pie

wedding balloons
the squeak and squeal
of tying a knot

grandma's promise
a bowl of cherries
when tomorrow comes

pebble beach
tide by tide
wave by wave

suicide spot
the artless rise of fulmars
on an updraught

sunken stream
a glimpse of the towhee
mostly song

the languid arc
of a koi's fin
rippled dusk

gleaming milky way
the ratchet
of the frog's throat

a sea breeze
children drawing sails
on the sand

birthnight
my ear
to a seashell

forest hush
only the drum
of me

moonless night
the distant flaring
of surplus gas

first drizzle
i cup my hands under
her tiny hands

family reunion
bats scritching
in the cabin walls

blistering heat
a storytelling of ravens
on the riverbed

dad's last summer
between us a complete understanding
of baseball

the end
of a chalk rainbow
foreclosure sign

wild raspberries
the woman with bad teeth
has a full basket

the echo
of the empty stables
autumn stillness

making it
look easy
autumn leaves

long noodles
entangled in a bowl
autumn deepens

smiling pumpkins
a little girl carries
her wings

night frost
i can hear the moonlight
creaking in the garden

nearly deaf
the beautiful songs
of crows

veteran's day
strong winds show up
for little flags

the pet hawk shuffles
along his perch
autumn wind

feathers we're allowed
to keep
november wind

another game show
my mother settles down
into her shadow

bone scan
a long stare
past blooming thistles

blackberry picking
plump beads
of blood

end of summer
the great seeding
of the land

moonlit puddles
the stillness of gulls
on a motel roof

starry night
the draught horse's shoes
spark on concrete

upturned cicada
we read slave narratives
row by row

a hard rain
the downspout
changes its tune

autumn wind
a wild umbrella
beats me to the bus

rutting season
surveyor's stakes
mark what's ours

moonrise
the raven folds
into itself

moon snails
climbing eel grass
summer solstice

incoming tide
the rippling shadow
of a gull's flight

frigate in dry dock
the spider on the mainmast
hoists a moth

mapping a continent
songlines
of the southern humpback

big sky
the end to end
of blue

headlong off the jetty
when i was
a superhero

last car payment
my dog's head outside
the window

strung
between two kookaburras
the shine of a skink

summer doldrums
a fly buzzes into
the beagle's yawn

butterfly
on a dandelion
the baby's laugh

morning sunshine
a doe up to her shoulders
in sweet corn

raspberry thicket
a rabbit hides
its heartbeat

dusk-deep clouds
the rumble of a freight train
shakes loose a star

walk-off double
the pitcher tastes the string
of his glove

perseids
two chairs mid-lawn
the morning after

lost in the full moon
a mosquito
brings me back

ending summer
a rowboat
tied to fog

forgetting names
starlight through a hole
in the overcast

dragonfly on the clothesline
the sun shifts
from wing to wing

winter sun
the rosy glow
of crab apple jelly

best ofs
and worst ofs
another orbit

to be
or not to be
winter

high tide
beach and sea
swap driftwood

illegally entering
the next state
dad's ashes

cat's whiskers
sensing the space
you need

we halve the muffin
the boundaries
of our friendship

cracked vases
the way my
mother saw god

amish dolls
with no faces
fertility clinic

holocaust museum
a child's shoe
behind glass

winter pine
eight needles
fill the moon

an eagle
its shadow
sculpted in the sea

within the mud
and muck of winter
eagle song

morning icicles
the time it takes
for the dog to pee

tomato juice
tasting of tin
cabin fever

open grave
sometimes silence
says it all

a week after the funeral
the hotel's request
for feedback

walden pond
where the cabin once stood
deer tick warning

outside
using our inside voices
monarch sanctuary

dappled moonlight
fawns all but disappear
beneath the cedar

empty nest
a bowerbird dancing with
a blue stick

pink blossoms
open ears collecting
the sound of bees

swamp irises
a butterfly returns
to the same stone

fern glen
we find the creek
by its song

in a manger
of fiddleheads
a fawn

earth's rotation
a dandelion casts
a shadow

crime scene
a butterfly pauses
with me

star jasmine
there's no right way
to die

sign of summer
a street child frees
an old newspaper kite

snow dust
covers the garden
whispered prayers

the wick's sizzle
before the flame steadies
first birthday alone

clink of condiments
in the refrigerator door
sleeting rain

first bach
after his death
the silences

skiing
i think of the ants
beneath the snow

smiling plastic bag
failed
to become a cloud

april snow
wish i knew more
about grandpa

morning light
part of a robin's egg
catches the wind

fern spores
his choice to return
to where he was born

a house fly
until i open
the window

with someone
who understands
wind in the alders

scent of rain
a partridge drums
from a dry stone wall

geese honking
i left home
to find home

pioneer cemetery
here and there a name
faces heavenward

part maggot
part bone
part prayer

the suspended hoof
of the ragman's horse
stopped time

how long
a thousand years is
pine needles in wind

getting it right
the first time
the moon

river mouth
the incoming tide
takes it all back

white water rafting
the river in my eyes

new bathing suits
filling the boat
with laughter

night fishing
all we imagine
still out there

out of the depths
of the mountain
bluebird

the neighborhood
where i would live
climbing roses

slugs
boneless wandering
in the lettuce bed

a dry creek bed
ghost limbs
of the cottonwoods

birch bark
unraveling in the wind
spring break

this greening mist
the winter‑burned azalea studded
with vermillion flowers

perhaps
there is a heaven
cherry blossoms

metro station
a wistful face at the window
in the moving train

first light
my dream mother opens
her blue eyes

lilac dusk
i bring home the flower girl's
smile

a weed in my hand
magic in yours
dandelion

swarms of butterflies
crossing the border
rumors of war

the overwhelming
responsibility
day lily

wishing fountain
most thoughts
still a penny

dry spell
stars sink deeper
into the well

trailer park
never enough shade
for the chained dogs

sandstorm
a gecko
licks its eye

distant thunder
names of our ancestors
sink back into stone

ghost town
i walk through
all the open doors

painted cliffs
echo the old ways
coiled snake

shots of tequila
bat voices
mapping the night

light rain
the smell of air
when the lightning strikes

thunderstorm
gods throw out
their old furniture

field of poppies
a few
tall ones

the beginning
of my imagination
summer solstice

last day of school
a wisteria pod
bursts open

i tell him first
about seeing the eagle
father's day

trail spur
tendrils of wisteria
and cigarette smoke

cloud of no-see-ums
bluegills
tease the bobber

the sheen
of her pearl earring
summer moon

lingering twilight
i tuck a jasmine garland
in my braid

summer breeze
now and then
mother's fragrance

picasso
i see different wife
my in a way

cold summer
one suitcase circling
baggage claim

new turtle nest
ship lights fade
into sunrise

the sun high
over the chaparral
soaring red-tails

through the camera's eye
gleaming
the elephant's eye

in my palms
the bullfrog's heartbeat
deepens summer

summer rain
a dog and cat
share the doghouse

evening hail
the tap taps of brake lights
past the exit

bottom rung
devil's paintbrush
rubs at my heels

el nino
dust colors
the dying bee

now retired
his pride measured
in asparagus

sweltering heat
plop after plop of tomatoes
tossed into buckets

rustling leaves
fear as old as
the forest itself

numberless stars
a long stick to keep
the campfire going

just before dawn
pleiades opens the sky
the warbler's melody

evening calm
a trout glides through a bay
of spent caddis nymphs

school's back
yabbies escape
the purging bucket

popcorn clouds
a little girl sings
her abcs

wild horses
shadows of wind
in the floating dust

evening walk
even the clouds
are dog shaped

smell of pesto
a lorikeet scatters
birdseed

the east coast storm
in her voice

sunset
the click of cicadas
downshifts

call of the red deer stag
mist gathers
under the great bear

full moon
all the places
you could be

autumn equinox
measuring nightfall
pumpkin by pumpkin

hermit thrush
the last of a sun patch
slips off a birch

dark phase
of the moon
i go incognito

dipping sun
a bittern blends
into the reeds

fallen leaf
scent of unsipped
whiskey

starlight
where they fell soft bodies
of bogong moths

scent of apples
feel of the paring blade
between my fingers

morning sun
stroking its warmth
through the old dog's fur

election fever
my preschooler inks his
index finger

indian summer
the bright green
of wet paint

cold winds
the receding tempo
of rain

crow feather
before dusk
the feel of dusk

the hourglass
runs faster now
an eyelash moon

a mist
slipping through the morning woods
coyote

morning sky
stars become
starlings

fishing village
a rumor of blues running
through the cafe

summer wind
we ask a younger couple
where we are

winter sun
i look for something useful
to do with my hands

new year’s day
waiting
for the wishbone to dry

snowflakes
no two winters
quite the same

the time it takes
to thaw the breast milk 
winter night

winter seclusion
yeast froth rises
in candlelight

in the quiet
of a love scene
our cat purrs

decrystalizing
the jar of honey
january sunrise

a howl
crossing the ice
the moon

late in the day 
the hiss of water
boiling over

winter thaw
the spilled seed cool
to the touch

choke cherries 
press of my skeleton
through the flesh

thudding surf 
her permission
to be blunt

sequoia national park
i promise my grandkids
they’ll grow tall

lifeless bumblebee 
the ground around it
darkens with raindrops

hailstone
it tastes a little
of wild onion

anniversary
an old dress on the line
fills with wind

gibbous moon
my son tells his part
of the story

nursing blisters
at the halfway mark
soft mossy rocks

cloudburst
the sound of raindrops
changing size

summer night
my cat speaks to it
through a screen

backstroke 
her navel ring glints
in the moonlight

second week
away from home
wild blackberries

alone at dusk
ice-blocks resettle
in my glass

old letters
flotsam on a river
to the ocean

city dweller 
the sound of the interstate
i call the ocean

rain of stars
the eyes of wish-makers
sparkle with hope

light shimmers
on the undersides of leaves
scent of clay

shooting star 
those things
we tell no one

just inside
the garden gate
the first bench

old orchard beach
before i could think it
cassiopeia

pulling
the push door
vernal equinox

the road disappearing
into wetlands of mist
i keep going

the scent of turned earth
across seeded fields
twilight

hawthorn breeze
the white bob
of a rabbit’s tail

spring wind
our dog barks
where i’m hiding

wildflowers
i cannot name
most of me

twin lambs
the ewe keeps watch
over the one not moving

her note
in my pocket
cherry buds

the best conversations
are in my head 
rain on the windowpane

may rain 
i stretch my body
over the whole bed

gulls cry
in a gun-metal sky 
the still water

circling her grave
a bitter wind
shifts the family

the hedgehog
yet to hibernate
rain-matted leaves

under her coat
my shirt
first snowflakes

almost winter 
the blind man’s dog
looks at me

lamplit breath
floats along the shore
ghost stories

pecans falling 
we wait for our grandson
to visit

church bell
the smell
of snow

the headstones tilt
at different angles
dustings of snow

flickering lights
he notices my handwriting
on the presents from santa

full moon chill
in the green tomatoes
a change of plans

north wind
and the swirl of leaves 
this fire within

the apples left
in a leafless tree a prayer
for your lymph nodes

first snow 
still knitting
the second mitten

northern lights 
the feel of a planet
beneath my feet

ignoring the directions
on the gps 
indian summer

autumn afternoon
mother touches
my thinning hair

veterans day 
first red flower
on the cactus

hosing the garden
off the carrots 
thanksgiving

a crow at dusk 
ink sinks deeper
into the page

toddler’s first
one small step
toward the moon in the window

autumn moonlight
a migrant worker sings
his way home

smoke drifts
from a fajita stand
plaza autumn

the right shoes
in the wrong size
october moon

scent of balsam 
shapes of geese
held in the mist

sheen of apples 
in a migrant child’s lap
her own dirty feet

my mother braiding my hair
i realize now
how young she was

walking alone 
my face
disassembles

rushing home
as though you were still there
autumn dusk

autumn leaves
the songs we learn
as children

the desert stars 
i almost believe
his forever

a neighbor’s dog howls
with the sirens 
night heat

the ocean’s roar
on the forest hike
my second-wind

dry thunder
one yellow leaf trickles
from all of the green

fluffy seed pods 
the evening air heavy
with party chatter

death valley
a man who’s never been there
tells me all about it

as great
as the grizzly
the fear

sand fishing
the long shadow
attached to his heels

your cologne
lingers on my skin
day moon

summer’s end
we topple a pyramid
of beer cans

rush hour haze
the traffic warden swats away
a cherry petal

clapboard house
in the just plowed field
sundown

first light 
the soft-sleep breath
of my newborn child

gnats gnats gnats
my bobber
disappearing

ladybug outbreak
the wish i make
again and again

childhood home
i dig out the roots
of a tree i planted

a tributary
muddies the main stream 
middle of spring

the unfading
sun in your face
amaranth

tipping rain
the bull trudges
between tussocks

cormorant’s dive
waiting
until my eyes hurt

squirrel chatter
in the woodshed
a cache of cones

jade tea cup
the fallen leaves
of the poinsettia

snow-covered hills 
my sister and i coast
into the new year

winter moon
across the wall
my long shadow

city zoo
a wolf looks up
at snow

end of yuletide 
i harvest all the balls
from the christmas tree

dusk
i’m just another glow
amid traffic

winter night
i pick the last grain
of rice from the plate

expanding universe
the homeless man looks
for a place to sleep

a train trip
to mongolia
winter stars

snow moon
bitter wormwood
still on her tongue

all i wanted
to tell her
bare winter trees

pisces rising 
the big one
runs with my line

my cold hands
a scrabble of bird claws
on the guttering

coffee perking
a ray of sunshine streams
into the rain

wintering
their different ways
birch and pine

honey-dipped figs 
the argument
i should have made

huddled pigeons
a taxi waits
in winter rain

wild weather
something of it
stirring in me

vernal equinox
the tender shoots
of weeds

harvest moon
over an empty wheat field
gettysburg

just can’t help it
correcting the grammar
of the blues singer

full moon
he asks if i’m ready
to sing

dusky nettlebed
the stream just deep enough
for ducks to dabble in

falling oak leaf 
dance macabre
of its shadows

big city morning 
shadows hiding
my shadow

autumn clouds
a carly simon poster
fades into barnwood

honking geese
the jumble of pumpkins
at a roadside stand

yellow leaves in the current
a mink
after a mink

no way out
death’s at the door
demanding candy

glowing embers
i tell her a story
she already knows

new year’s day 
a finch's weight
turns the pinwheel

nearly spring
the refrigerator magnet
losing its grip

late spring rain
their prize dahlias
eaten by a cow

dentist’s chair
butterfly wings on the window
open and close

white lilies
in a stoneware vase 
she speaks of her mother

father’s day
teeth missing
from the pocket comb

trees barely green
the latest graduates
stumble into line

winter stars 
lichen sparkles
on a birch branch

hint of spring
the weeds picked
for my hair

midday thaw
the blackbird’s feathers
full of rainbows

furrows curving
over the hill
a line of crow-topped trees

through my earmuffs
the sound
of a spring bird

late winter
the night scented
with noodles

almost spring
scent of a woman’s hair
in the elevator

birdsong
an icicle drops
into my shadow

first spring day 
a blue heron works at
an unruly feather

sunrise
tadpoles emerge
from my shadow

sun on my back 
all the flower pots
arranged just so

there they are
in the bonsai exhibit
pot of weeds

autumn sunrise 
a muskrat grooms the dew
into its coat

trail of leaves
the child’s plastic rake
missing teeth

indian summer
small boys run naked
on the tide line

petting farm 
first the children
chase the geese

her birthday 
i count the rosebuds
left on the bush

red maple leaves
scattered on moss 
the sound of falling water

breezy afternoon
children chasing children
chasing leaves

wind in the reeds 
my daughter speaks
about forgiveness

alone now
the drake’s wash
at both banks

tall pines 
i’ll never be ready
to go home

sweet peas
pulling the color
from the sky

crowds
at the meat market
incense mingles

intermission
sharing an awning
with the rain

bush trail
the astonishing color
of jellybeans

drifting seed fluff
the rented horse
knows an hour’s worth

venetian vase
the glass blower pauses
to admire a cloud

chinese opera
her voice inside
my teacup

deep thunder 
a blue tail skink
slips under the door

morning sleet
someone at the bus stop
humming

winter morning
the sound of grandma
zipping her boots

scotch mints 
the squeak of my walking stick
in packed snow

sleet through bare trees
a titmouse shows me
a fiery black eye

my brother’s hello
the chill of the wind
on his jacket

fresh snow
for the hands
for the face

snowy day 
nothing ordinary
about an orange

the birch trunk’s sheen
moves when i do
winter solitude

burial
mourners and bare trees
blend

her empty bed 
night rain
on fallen leaves

so set in my ways 
winter window with a
potted geranium

soot-dusted snow
the shadow of my rebuke
on the child’s face

behind the locked gate
more snow buries
thin gravestones

winter garden
the puppy unearths bones
the lost dog buried

snow falling 
the same sound
in all her shells

january sales
a clown’s car steals
my parking space

troubled by words
i look away 
moonlight on crusty snow

winter stars 
the cat’s caterwaul
between junked cars

yesterday’s snow 
the dog’s path
one way

giggles
in grandma’s afghan
winter moon

clear whistle
of the white-throated sparrow 
evening star

half moon
something slips into the pond
besides me

river rock 
the folded wings
of a damselfly

stone causeway
the creek’s summer flow
rearranging pebbles

silent woods
a growing awareness of
the need to breathe

mother and daughter
each in her own thoughts
fireflies

waking
in the fetal position
the river’s hum

waterfall view 
soba noodles slipping
from my chopsticks

noon heat
a swallow just ahead
of its shadow

wind upriver 
undersides of cottonwood leaves
rippling silver

spring sun

the leafless plum

budding trees

locked to the sky

in coffee mugs

april shower
she says her chalk flower has
grown a little

the hand on my shoulder
once reached up for mine

a wheat penny lands
heads up

with a chunk of bread

i wear a little less
blush

drizzling sky
a little girl drinks
from her mother’s cup

spring shower
her parasol opens
to take him in

shaker village
the clarity
of birdsong

drifting clouds
the exam hall
bright sometimes

small window
and a bird too fast
to name

rose thorns
the soft whirl
of a spinning wheel

hot night 
riffs
and midriffs

first light 
broken blue shells
under the maple

spring bird song
a girl comes first
to the peep-hole

the tinkling
of recycled glass
spring drizzle

girls with long pigtails
jump double-dutch

a moth the color of heather
on the heather

3rd day of guests 
the soup pot
blows its lid

sand dollar
the morning’s first set
of footprints

camera shoot 
seafroth clings
to her cleavage

boarding the greyhound 
one seat left
on the ocean side

sudden downpour
the lizard takes its shadow
into a wall hole

thunderstorm
white pigeons stroll
the man-of-war’s deck

beach shack
a garden
of shells

windswept dunes 
the road map flaps
on the scorching hood

rearview mirror 
dark clouds gathering
into a twister

stalactites
the howls of children
echoing back

wind-bent grasses
we bow to each other
goose and i

chill evening
all the nuts
are almonds

taking a bite
from the wild apple
old old memories

new year’s eve
rain becomes hail
becomes silence

new year’s day
we both feel the kick
inside her

autumn downpour
a tow truck pulling
another

grandpa’s dead
the call of wild geese
faintly heard

unpacking a new home 
do whales strand themselves
in this bay?

winter stillness
the bed starts
purring

winter morning 
the outline of the city
on venetian blinds

late summer 
blue jays not answering
a crow

hay baler
in its wake a swathe
of cricket song

crickets droning
the tennis ball covered
with slobber

distant stadium cheers
a black branch releases
a drop of dew

morning sun
field too small
for the horse’s shadow

dusk 
father and son
scything the meadow

cool dusk
our hands busy husking
fresh corn

warm night 
a soda machine rejects
my coin

bedtime 
fruit flies linger
after the fruit

end of summer
only a breeze
in the butterfly net

warm evening
an open door
to someone's living room

dawn   
the neighbor's newborn
stops crying

morning sun
washing the window
at puppy-nose height

temperature rising
the basset hound stretches
another inch

this downpour
of plum rain
i polish the silverware

lazy afternoon
two grasshoppers mating
on my sandal

chipmunk
in the hawk's talons
an acorn falls

coastal rain
sweeps the potato field
the lustre of crows

screened window
faintly in and out of view
a woman's face

new summer dress
the roses in her garden
less symmetrical

well-worn ruts
between the old maples
hand in wrinkled hand

first cast
sunlight along the line
sinks into the sea

twilight glow
a raft of pond geese
drifts in silence

curve by curve
i follow her down
the river

summer solstice
a school of minnows suspended
in the stream

forest path
a spider web
catches my ear

eyes closed
to a new morning
mockingbird melodies

not watching the fireworks
the big black dog
in a child's lap

a cool current
where the river deepens
summer sky

flattened grass
where the bear slept
stink of salmon

silent friends meeting
the sound of chairs being moved
to enlarge the circle

dewpoint
the kleenex flowers wilt
on a parade float

taos sunrise
a polished pot
on the adobe sill

last night's rain
the bird bath full
of sparrows

new leaves
the tree growing
through a roof's remains

a boy pitching pennies
into the water basin
lowering clouds

summer humidity
the circular motion
of the carousel

between innings
the joy of the game
on my son's face

clearing sky
a child washes pebbles
in a puddle

ready to garden
in the potting shed she gathers
her love handles

tornado sky
the mockingbird keeps
right on singing

midday train ride
fanning the child
with dr seuss

summer evening
the woodpecker
finishes

fallen apples
the mare's warm breath
in my hand

all hallow's eve
the summer people's porch light
on all day

creeping fog
a little moonlight
crosses the river

geese overhead
the dog stops licking
to listen

door slammed
her perfume lingers
in the frosty air

husking
the band of white skin
where mother's ring was

a child's magician hat
dust motes float
in the moonlit attic

autumn moon
the luminous whiskers
of a cat

willows
in river mist
year's end

snowflakes whirl
in the headlights
ghost stories

melting snow
the distance between
someone else's steps

new catkins
a moose's behind
at the edge of the willows

childhood home
the pussy willow
just as it is

my tears come
then the sound
spring rain

goose flight
my gossipy neighbor
speechless

snowmelt
beaver dam swept
to the river's edge

early spring
her hand-painted robin
in my mailbox

house for sale
a bluetit tries out
all the nest boxes

may day
bees collecting nectar
from wilted azaleas

moonlit garden
the asparagus
overcooked again

circle of lamplight 
i complete the baby quilt
begun for me

between windows
the space the spider
lived and died

another soldier
the sound of wind
through a hole in the fence

catching rain
on my tongue 
scent of plum blossoms

in like a lion
the buds
of a pussywillow

rush hour 
spring snow covers
the roadside memorial

first buds
droplets too fine
for the wiper

spring sunshine
we look round a house
we can’t afford

spring equinox
the precise pitch
of a sparrow

suddenly spring
i read the ending
first

no one
to forgive
spring again

drifting cherry petals
a window goes up
in the passing limousine

easter egg hunt
he brings back
horseapples

winter morning
suds
still on the soap

walking
one inch closer to heaven

snow
on the stones
the stream

snowflakes
the perfect fit
of our hands

the pile of apple peels
growing

evening stillness
a bonfire log slips
into its own ash

dawn light
on a red-tailed hawk
indian summer

a woodpecker starts
the day

most of the fallen leaves
hidden by others

the beach stones underfoot
more painful now

around the table
three generations
and the dog

autumn sunrise
the bristled coat
of a hereford steer

indian summer
the road crew plays catch
with a hardhat

autumn light
the deer’s shadow
touches my toes

waiting for the rains
both sides
of the pillow hot

shimmering heat
a rattlesnake flashes
its new skin

midday heat 
the glassblower’s bubble
impossibly thin

sun shower 
children hopscotch
in pavement steam

wilderness canyon
my shout and its echo
quickly lost in time

rising sun
the flies and i
remain still

circling
the overland stage marker
migrating hummers

blazing sun
i tell her
what i really think

the crammed beak
of a blackbird 
summer rain

climbing in shadow 
the canyon rim
brightly lit

on the road
as i turn each yellowed page
breaks free

foghorns
the ginkgo’s last leaves
fall with the snow

winter commute
the train’s momentum
in the small of my back

filtered through pine
the pygmy owl’s staccato 
flecks of moonlight

winter night
i sip ginger tea
from my sister’s cup

cold snap
hotdog vendor dancing
to warm his feet

first snow
one child
wakes the others

new year’s eve
the old janitor
wrings out his mop

new year’s eve
one side of the mare
dusted with snow

orion overhead
our last kiss of the year
is the first of the next

golden hour
a nuthatch pauses
partway down the trunk

riff
of radio jazz
wren

autumn dusk
enough light
to count the leaves

leaf-fall
my echo
returns

old schoolyard
dark ivy hides
the fucks

autumn sunset
the lit bellies on a string
of geese

orange sky
the cattle dog drinks
from my hands

how to tell
of the myriad rich browns?
pin-oak leaves

high school reunion
we view the leaves falling
in different ways

sagging totem pole
the tiny adze marks
in perfect rows

prairie 
nothing
higher

wild flax 
a minute of blue sky
on a cloudy day

late summer 
eelgrass turns
with the tide

fly-fishing
a mosquito’s buzz
in my ear

deep current
his long pause
before the lie

distant thunder
stargazer lilies
caught in the brush fire

blue sky
in the far distance
still penniless

pond at twilight
a least bittern scuttles
through the sedges

sound of water
a fish rests
on my foot

evening sun
the shadow of a fence
on my face

moonglow
the hoot of an owl
circles the house

snowed in 
grandma’s faded notes
for tatting

cold rainy night
salt drifts to the bottom
of the shot glass

nor’easter
another puzzle piece
clicks into place

spring moon
all night long
the mockingbird’s song

of the sea

the outstretched fingers
of a toddler
first winter rain

storks again
in the old nest

the beggar dumps a spider
from her cup

puts up a fight

about end-of-life

of old glories

drifts round

at dusk

my face

in the rain

from both slopes

we didn’t catch

from the tide

what i would say
if asked

around the japanese maple

brightens the soup

from jesus

emerging from the pine cone
i just sprayed silver
the matching spider

with the rain

the rip
of a sheet of paper
deep autumn

the tops of hay bales
sparkle with frost

on the coffee shop counter

of two-by-fours

in my sink

of an apple

she tosses her bra
out of the hayloft

of unused crystal

on the wheelbarrow

in the notes
of the sax
autumn rain

packed in cellophane

against the windowpane

and one spring peeper

children watching
its ups and downs

a redwood forest

sunshine fills the place
where he huddled

you didn't have to
be there at woodstock

in the baby's room

a cicada drops
onto the easel pad

of raspberries

of a kingfisher

in his sleep

one hundred times

without me

around barbed wire
first leaves

the clink of change
in a roadside coffee can
cut daffodils

working the kinks out
of the vine

folding the tripod
the cloud i photographed
drifts apart

settles

into a steel bowl

on the roach

dripping

she tells the whole story
in a single breath

at halftime

to hear the trees

these photographs
mother never pasted in

empty clothesline 
the mockingbird
begins his song

slant of light
through autumn woods 
whitethroat’s minor whistle

full moon 
the baby monitor
sighs

pine scent in the air 
a memory of memère
cleaning house

winter dawn
a tub of washing
all run blue

frosty morning
steam rises
from the horses’ blankets

grease oozes
from a ferris wheel
the long day

farmers’ market 
fruitflies pointing out
the ripe ones

the coolness
of evening grass
our first time

sunny morning 
the rooster challenges
the bull again

back at work 
the mosquito bite
blossoms

midsummer 
the uneven whirl
of a hula hoop

girl fiddler last to play
sugar at the bottom
of the lemonade cup

biting into the fig
how red
his heart tattoo

power outage 
forced outside to read
i put down my book

city sidewalk
colors swirl in a bubble
of spit

glowing coals
buried in the ashes 
peepers at dawn

first light 
not enough words
for green

dawn yoga 
forms change
with a rooster’s call

funeral
her long hair follows
the wind

turning the corner 
a breath of laundry
and lilacs

moonlight
on the sapling’s branch
an unexpected flower

pulled from sleep
by the solstice moon
cowbells

ascension day
pastry crumbs
for the bird-table

the bearded iris

the laughter
of elderly friends
magnolia rain

puff of dust

a flash of red
in the pine tree

katydid chorus
nothing that can’t wait
until tomorrow

a cactus wren
sips from the end of a hose

the last crop planted 
changing the tire
on the tree swing

the flycatcher’s wheeep
last sliver of sun
on the ridge

winter morning 
dad’s butter in a cup
atop the toaster

winter morning
her perfume scents
the river path

the last of winter
the crucifix covered
with a purple shroud

march wind
the story of a couple
who separate

mating robins
the broken yellow
of the centerline

children’s laughter 
a weekend father
with sticks in his hair

church bells
tree roots have cracked
the sidewalk

clearing sky
a hailstone melts
on the fallen flower

the void she leaves
a honeybee enters
an apple blossom

first buds
she only counts
the green cars

snow country
every word
you say

she finds
her great grandmother 
lichen on the stone

fresh snow
the cat’s paws deep
in eiderdown

raking leaves 
the two of us together
until dark

cold moon 
a stray dog roams
the village street

pearl harbor day 
the clerk validates
my parking stub

grandma’s birthday
snowflakes fill the letters
carved into the stone

new year’s morning 
a toothbrush color
i’ve never used

north wind 
a new edge
on the old axe

calls from listeners
who’ve been through the same
winter stars

spring shower
dark hands skinning catfish
in the kitchen sink

leaf buds
the flycatcher
varies his call

almost no
cards to buy
father’s day

dawn
the broken edge
of a blue shell

sunday morning 
gathered ibis
drown out the prayer

rainy season
a smile on everything
the child draws

searching willow wands
for the purple phoebe
my water bottle flutes

his parting gift
origami swans
lasting this long

day moon
a girl with dog tags
skipping rope

gardenia
just knowing
its scent

rearview mirror 
yellowing leaves
and my gray hair

faded recipe
peeling apples
with grandma

the last leaves fall
from the wild grape

fading light
a red rubber ball
on the grate

thorn by thorn
pale moonlight down
a century plant

grandfather’s house
light of the moon
on an unpruned tree

the smile
lost in her wrinkles 
deep autumn

cooler now
street children sniff glue
in the twilight

evening breeze 
hundreds of lamp flames
sway in the temple

autumn wind
grocery flyers
flying

home for the weekend
a water lily’s root
trailing out of sight

summer clouds
she talks about death
hypothetically

fishing
where my brother stood 
twilight chill

cicada song
just enough embers
to rekindle the fire

sale pending 
crunched apples scent
the sidewalk

moonflowers 
i weave a wreath
for my sister’s urn

mountain sunset
the mockingbird’s song
unanswered

fallen tree
on the river
i’ve yet to cross

sunrise 
goldenrod
in the first frost

no rain for days 
a half-eaten apple taken away
from the fruit flies

a wasp nest
out of reach of the hose
autumn begins

filigreed moon
the soft edges
of her lingerie

morning fog
the music
between headlines

the deep hues
of worn ricing sticks
ojibwe harvest

farm stand 
a pie in each basket
of apples

early evening
i wait for sunset
to touch the birches

between the toes
of two lovers 
the moon

fall morning
marsh mud glistens
in the rowboat

prairie sunshine
a tiny flower
with an indian name

autumn evening
the clink of carnival rings
on empty bottles

new path 
the throat
of a violet

mother’s day
this year
the white carnation

mother’s day
a hummingbird drinks
between breezes

high noon
a carpenter bee busy
in the hoe handle

daisy chain 
a tick
already gorged

done for the day
my dad brings to supper
the smell of turned earth

cold spring rain
the depth
of her yawn

her long skirt
trembles 
the tulip leaf too

a pair of hens
peer through the fence 
apple blossoms

glass shards
in a circle of stones
spring sunset

goat bells
a light wind lifts
the butterfly wing

old tractor seat
filled with rain 
and birdsong

spring afternoon
her buttocks peek out
from my shirt

sunday morning 
picking empties
off the lawn

someone at the gate
the blue wren rounds up
all his hens

early spring 
when the rain stops
i close the door

distant virga
the ranch dog’s eyes
different colors

spring break
rival shirts flying
together on the line

the neighbors’ tiff
envelops the valley
bees in the cherry tree

a sea of blossoms 
will every bird
find its mate?

morning rush hour 
an osprey points a fish
into the wind

the still cumulus
a hum of voices
before the workshop

muggy night
our room fan ruffles
the front page

bright morning 
walking the pain
from my heart

wandering
from birdsong to birdsong
city morning

salt spray
a taste of peat
in my whisky

evening warmth 
latchkey kids play rummy
in the doorway

sunrise
we lower
the blinds

crowded square 
a mime’s glance
crosses mine

merry-go-round
no one wants to ride
the wolf

heat lightning
places where the mower
cut too low

key west sunset 
trading one shell
for another

the faded blue
of a lifeguard station 
empty shells in my pocket

a beach ball
the gentle slap
of the moon

where the boys sat
a semi-circle
of watermelon seeds

thunderhead
a snake’s path
slicing up the dune

warm rain
his childhood memories
about the beach

soft-shell crabs 
the toddler shows off
her belly button

weathered dock 
a child reaches out
to smooth a wave

wind in the tall grass
an old blue car
almost in motion

gray day
smoke from a mill meanders
over the river

cormorants near dusk
perched over the tidewater
all hunched all black

the flute’s first notes
three lavender petals fall
from the arrangement

the slow turn
of a barber's pole
afternoon heat

back at camp
the mountain peak
still in my legs

black water
a goose paddles
through morning snow

creak of the swing
my feet still reach
the sky

country road
i quietly cross
the equator

twilight
a child’s pail taken
by the tide

tern feathers
in the surfcaster’s hat 
autumn sunset

rock strata
the space in the photo
between grandma and me

daylight moon 
faded chalk stars
on the sidewalk

foghorns
i’d forgotten how close
we live to the river

morning mist 
a train whistle mingles
with the moravian band

the car packed
one last pebble
cast into the sea

pay day
the field hand bends over
his lotto scratcher

the sound of the stream
returns

september morning
none of the students
has failed

lunch with my ex
a kingfisher preens
in the bare orchid tree

sunday drive 
the spider web snaps
as i pull away

light lace curtains
caught by a breeze 
dandelion seeds

summer noon
the taste of childhood
in forest berries

the river’s movement
glimpsed through trees
midsummer eve

prayer for peace
the ripples of striders
overlapping

summer shower
we pass through
to a dry street

lightning flash
both cats asleep
on the tile floor

no breeze
children on branches
swing their legs

moon shimmer
a whippoorwill
stammers

a friend
a friend of a friend
twilight

fallen leaves
the child in her
gives a kick

coyotes
the strange shape
of moonlit mist

sudden gust 
the toddler points
in his sleep

waking alone 
mourning doves
in the rain

piano practice
her hand reaches
into the morning sun

lakeshore at dusk
the mountain reappears
with strawberry snow

blackout
children cast animal shadows
by candlelight

midnight
one branch sawing
through another

a ray of sun
invisible
until the goldfinch

lilacs on the breeze
lingering
i reset the sundial

the stone back 
ants that were under
the stone

cherry petals drifting
across the sunny porch
the cat yawns

cracks in cement 
pre-packaged soil
for wildflower seeds

spring wind 
the pregnant woman walks
into the ocean

last light
the mockingbird
tries a new song

mother’s day alone 
a neighbor’s first iris
pokes through the fence

potting shed
the scattered leaks
of sunlight

workday over 
she presses her face
into wet lilac leaves

evening calm
a hummingbird works her way up
the trumpet vine

summer solstice
a roofer lays new slates
among the old

sultry morning
the child’s rag doll
slumped on the veranda

touching the tree
where we carved our names
water shimmers

eiderdown
on the river
august moon

a snail
thrusts out its horns
soft rain

thunderheads
the clam dropped by a gull
misses the rock

reading a harlequin
in the shade of a tree 
the heat

grass on the graves
a whippoorwill
far away

fresh palette
a fisherman whets
his blade

autumn ocean
the wind
in a wave

late summer
no place in the corn
where you’re not touched

one egg
rattling in the pot
autumn rain

stones in the rootmass
of a fallen tree 
winter stars

stone angel
a hint of life
in the winter trees

letter from home
the snow muddy
wherever i step

almost spring
untangling the streamers
on the windsock

almost spring
the way she says
edamame

high tide in the slough
two little boys pole
into a foreign land

winter sun 
trying to believe
in my beliefs

snow field 
a raven rises
into its cry

buttermilk
seeps from the churn 
wild onions

a wash of daisies
along the cliff top
the whales give a blow

ripples in the tidepool 
a quieter ocean
in my child’s shell

muddy towpath
the cyclists
avoid my eyes

sun behind the hills
a long cast
into stillness

long walk home 
kicking a stone
for company

dark river
the swimming mudhens
leave silver wakes

sound of anklets
on the winding path
river song

spring snow
the sound of the bottom
of someone’s bowl

her ponytail
skipping along

walks backwards

a bumblebee enters
the flower’s cup

then the bees

green with spring

at childhood memories

the hand of a student who
may know the answer

in the squirrel’s belly

still wet
after crossing
spring wind

down syndrome child
bent over a tidepool 
the anemone opens

a spring welcome
ripples through the length
of the beagle

torn caution tape
at the trailhead

as if moss
were not enough 
the spotted salamander

overnight bus
a young boy picking things
from his sleeping father’s hair

a picture of tulips
on an empty sack
almost spring

back to back
checking who’s taller
spring equinox

pretending this is
our first kiss

black cockatoos
the distant rumble
of harleys

refugee camp 
a mother croons a lullaby
to her unborn child

grandpa’s desk
i sharpen a pencil stub
just for the sound

border town 
all the houses
with a dog to beware of

dry stream bed
only the loud pulse
of cicadas

so many memories
gliding pelicans
rearrange themselves

in the bottom
of a leaky rowboat 
a glimmer of stars

back to school 
graffiti visible
beneath fresh paint

twilight
a red pony narrowing
the distance to the barn

creekbed
curlews poke their bills
the whole way in

an anchor dropped
all the stars in place
this last summer night

slow dawn
the first flower
on the marrow plant

childless
i stand with the others
by the river

organic garden
a cactus wren
probes for grubs

poking flowerpots
to see if they need water 
her faded house dress

dust motes
a careful sweep
around the cat

june bugs
under the street lamp
our goodnight kiss

dry riverbed 
a new kind
of silence

a bird sings
on my clothes line 
i can wait

an armful of lilies
in the fullness of summer
an urn full of ash

more gray in my hair 
a faint scent of mimosa
sweetens the breeze

muggy night
the child’s breathing turns
a paper moon

summer drizzle 
dark shadow of an umbrella
takes its time

pink honeysuckle 
trying to find the place
the creek used to run

longer days
a nameless bug
on my bicycle

clear summer sky
the breeze blowing rubbish
around children’s feet

leaving the fair
high on my father’s shoulders 
distant sunset

50th year
scent of honeysuckle
after the rain

dry grass
a donkey colt
learning to wallow

hot day
the bicycle chain
keeps slipping off

a mockingbird mimics
the ventriloquist

sunflower fields
girls in the jeep sing
my favourite things

the ant returns
after being flicked

walking acorns
into the earth

deep autumn
the gleam of his wedding band
as he tends the fire

beach to ourselves
a dusting of snow
on the driftwood

new year’s resolution
the fresh snow
already melting

soft light
we mound leaves
around the sapling

december dusk 
ink spilled on
a white canvas

bedtime
my children pray
for snow

red mittens
her laughter ahead
of the snowball

winter morning 
a roof beam swings
in the blue

the drifting boat
it must have nudged bluebells
somewhere upstream

in tall grass
the scent of honeysuckle

a herd of water buffalo
wades into the pond

neighbor’s quarrel
a climbing rose stretched
over the fence

morning thunder
mom and the dog
both favor a hip

meandering
lovers

spouting philosophy 
a giant salamander
has been watching us

water buffaloes
shoreline shadows pleat
the monsoon lake

a different pitch
from room to room
summer rain

storm damage
the sap still rising
in the stump of a maple

the rooster’s
first five syllables
all he’s got

lucky bamboo
a single leaf
tipped with sun

spring walk
just me and my
ponytail

bright jacaranda
filling the hill town courtyard 
the grindstone’s whir

sunset stroll
the labrador’s nose streaked
with pollen

brush strokes 
morning light warms
the spring roses

apple blossoms
with only me to witness
the path of the wind

tractor ruts
softened by rain
first buds

remnants of rain
between the flagstones 
morning prayer

the frog
slightly shifts his posture
summer evening

our new home 
winter sunshine fills
the empty rooms

damp earth
slick bellies
of winter radishes

the scent of snow 
a flake
then nothing

coldest day
steam from the sidewalk grates
rises undisturbed

winter stars
my feet slip slightly
on the path

apple trees
growing into each other
winter drizzle

winter break
my grandson’s
short sentences

mid-winter depression 
in my address book
crossing out the dead

twilight
the unexpected brightness
of snowdrops

late shift
again the waitress
talks of her children

winter stars 
you introduce me
friend by friend

another log on the fire
two kings
on the checker board

winter night 
i hear the cat’s purr
with my hands

winter night
cookie crumbs on both sides
of the bed

snowflakes
frozen to tree-bark
morning silence

cold evening 
changing my teacup
to the other cheek

the child’s nose
melts a hole in a frost fern 
windblown dark

one more goodnight 
halo around
the hunger moon

sunrise 
nothing on the snowman
stops the drip

hospice book cart
the one no one finishes
is back on top

spring twilight
the unexpected weight
of a swept snail shell

summer daydreams
the whicker
of a passing dove

no name for his illness
the plastic lid snaps back on
the coffee can

outgoing tide
jellyfish fade
with the sky

misty moon
strains of a boatman's song
lost at sea

loneliness
a piece of driftwood
keeps returning

bull through binoculars
blurred fence
focused eye

falls from the tree
the day lengthens

one long blast
from the ship's horn

footprints
a warm lantern
left on the sand

to flutter the flag

in the bag

guessing at the depth
of overnight snow

towards the dock

from new sandals

from the pens

with lotto tickets

shakes its head

of a screen door

beneath the cabinet

into the wind

of the toddler's diaper

kids in the pet store
teasing a rat

in the cornfield

memories
for a quarter

about to go by

overcome by cicadas

on cardboard

in the open doorway

to the water's edge

on the evening path

to take a driving test

plucks at his guitar

along the path

on birch bark

changes as i drink

on the pavement

independence day
next to the floats ants carry
a butterfly corpse

a rare wildflower graces
each molded bowl

lost in thought

drifts over the river

curves across the sun

we are alone

above the hanging tree

of a möbius strip

in the school yard

on broken glass

in my left knee

in the rain

left on the bridge

directly at me

as it hits the ground

one more load of wood
before dark

on snow

in the hummingbird feeder

we pick out
our house

of shirts vs skins

are insects

the shadow three times bigger
than the bird

to the rains

in our jelly jar

on each old pylon

my dad was alive

on the radiator

from the cat’s saucer

to her old cat

choosing the sunniest spot
to fill my tank

without his name

in my dream

of last summer

on the mountain

not what i expected

of candles

into the hamper

somewhere underneath

answered by another

of raindrops

on the windowsill

follows the pollen

in a spider web

summer afternoon

weaving through the treetops

have worn a groove

first cicada
i fold away
the blankets

cherry tomatoes
cradled in my hands
august heat

sunlight
grazes my fingers 
the first ripe peach

sculpture garden
roots of the strangler fig
create their own forms

the lake’s reflection
goes all the way out the limb
summer solitude

stirring wheat
the faint sound
of an ancient sea

placid lake 
the sound of bike wheels
on the gravel path

roadside stall 
in a tomato box
the trust coins

this evening
with no dog barking
autumn wind

decayed wet leaves 
on the storm drain
a blanched worm

calder sculpture
a single brown leaf tumbling
from the sky

autumn wind 
from next door’s garden
the sound of hide-and-seek

my monthly loss
for words

the dog keeps some slack
in his leash

one by one parachutists
return to earth

christmas shopping 
my daughter’s lip rolls
into her mother’s pout

fading light 
his voice in the crowd
of shadows

empty page
the dog’s gray muzzle
on my knee

sunlit ravine
a rope bridge
over butterflies

mile-long jetty
tourists toss starfish
into the sky

whale watching 
a distant cloud rains
into the sea

sent outside
while the old women talk
scent of sweetpeas

thunderclouds 
an aproned butcher
takes his lunchtime stroll

spring mountain wind
a traveller rests
on his hat

parents’ quarrel
through the glass-bottomed boat
another world

poppy garden
in and out of the flowers
the child’s red cap

storm brewing
our cat sphinxed out
on the porch rail

first summer rain 
the flower vendor
lingers on the porch

drought
the sound of the cat grooming
wakes me

earthquake
the orange tree drops
its scent

starlit night 
coolness settles
in my shoes

morning fog
a dark pine shape
sheds its crows

leaves on the river 
too old to call myself
orphan

insomnia
the cat
kneads my hair

apples picked
and the casket chosen 
lingering sunset

shooting star
the young girl wishes
for a white horse

autumn rain
having just said i love you
into a phone

still wanting
to fly these feathers
of the dead owl

first warm day
a hermit thrush
pumps its tail

spring festival
sunlight haloes
the baby’s hair

half-blown dandelion
my neighbor’s daughter
moves back in

tomb of the unknown 
bird shadows
in sudden flight

wet road
a shepherd watching me
slow down

scattered sun 
one chickadee louder
than the rest

a child bride
bows her head
the whitest peony

nowhere else
but the next flower 
afternoon butterfly

before and after
paying respects
a smoker in the rain

tripod holes
in the creekside mud 
yosemite dawn

snowstorm over
my grandson puts a seed
in my hand

morning walk 
nothing for the stone fence
to stop

without his wife 
throwing old bread
to the sparrows

passing clouds
the scent of wild thyme
on my fingers

red ribbon
on a sweat-lodge pole
fading sunset

fiddleheads
in the chill breeze
my fingers curl inwards

scent of blossoms
her house at the end
of the avenue

tilted gravestone
the weight
of a butterfly

cloud shadows 
an eagle picks over
what the tide left

twilight
the brush of dune grass
across bare shins

harvest time
watermelons tossed
man to man

farmers’ market
the snap of a green bean
over traffic noise

new moon 
one white chick strays
from the broody hen

sultry day
peaches packed at the bottom
of the grocery bag

bright estuary
the red jellyfish float in
with the tide

labor day
the plowboy pauses
for a photo

no crop this season 
the deep wrinkles
in his neck

roadside stand
the cold skin
of the last pear

end of vacation
palmetto husk dolls
with slanted smiles

war news
an old peasant talks to
the persimmon tree

blue-sky rain
among countless geese
the tundra swan

first blossoms
my cell phone
set to vibrate

spring thaw
the tracks below
tracks in the snow

the river bubbles
between stepping-stones
an upturned duck

march winds 
a man with a comb-over
changes direction

valentine’s day 
the cat leaves a hairball
on my pillow

first warm day
the pulse of the honeybee’s
abdomen

leap year
the frog
just sits there

spring mist 
the baby hippo
fills the puddle

spring dusk
the cat’s tail
off on a hunt

a wild rose
inside the caterpillars’ tent 
ocean sunrise

giving sound
to the submerged stone wall
my new kayak

faultline
wild eyes of the horses
as we cross

talk of peace
a fly in the sugar bowl
missing one leg

whispers
on a sultry night
salsa music

day moon
wind sculpts ripples
on the dunes

thunder
the old windmill
needing grease

sunday
the chorus of sparrows
in a church maple

fireworks display
missing
his oohs and ahhs

low-country creek 
the flow of spanish moss
from an osprey’s talons

evensong 
from the flooded field
a fullthroated frog

thunderhead 
a plume of smoke
from the old salt’s mouth

summer solstice
the measuring tape reels back
into its case

a hawk’s shrill
above the sunlit meadow 
empty mailbox

between a rock
and a hard place
the oncologist’s fish

singing gondolier
the passengers’
fixed smiles

the long day 
a mason drizzles mortar
between flagstones

berlin wall
a smooth stone
in my pocket

doctor’s waiting room 
each patient examined
by a fly

still alive!
a distant neighbor’s
summer-blooming maple

first snow
a drift of cattle
against the fenceline

the cat and i
walk together
all the fallen leaves

woodstove’s glow
the scent of oranges
studded with cloves

waxwings
exchange rose hips
christmas morning

a red flush
on the amaryllis bud
new year’s eve

falling leaves 
a street person
adjusts her bundles

echo of an axe 
wood smoke holds
in the hollow

letting out the dog
in the chill of dawn
the drifting stars

along the railing
hollows in the snow
where sparrows sat

early morning snow
the janitor shaves
at a barbershop sink

long sermon
snow gathers
on the windowsill

february thaw
goose droppings slip
into the pond

a long moment
before i recognize myself
spring puddle

first light
the wide-awake hats
in the lettuce field

seuss’s birthday
a dad and two lads plant
a plant in a planter

winter beach 
tire tracks turn back
on themselves

plum petals 
do they cross her path too
in march winds

growing season
the orchard flooded
with moonlight

spring equinox 
the sun shines through
an onion skin

spring’s light green
i can smile
without wanting anything

ocean fog
the mumble of eiders
gathered offshore

apple-picking day
the faded pattern
of grandma’s blouse

all souls’ day
a child tries to catch
the falling leaves

near dark 
the grand hotel drips
long after the rain

long winter 
prayer bundles sway
in the cedars

foggy morning 
tipping his hat
to the scarecrow

autumn dusk
a girl with pigtails milking
the black angus

wind and rain
the candle’s smoky flicker
as we speak of ghosts

a solitary night
this quiet communion
with fireplace flames

field of gravestones
not one tree to block
the sweeping wind

finding orion
how moonlight shines
in my daughter’s hair

where he drowned
the broad backs
of catfish

tending
her grave for spring 
tending my soul

wind chill 
walking backward
toward home

news of her cancer 
the radiance
of paperwhites

lantern moon 
i guide mother’s steps
around the duck pond

one purple finch 
the tick of sunflower husks
on first frost

bone cold
the lights from shore
lost to fog

lost 
i watch
a falling leaf

spring-like day
the cat grapples
with a catnip bird

white water 
a salmon ignores
the fish ladder

tranquil afternoon 
nicking moonflower seeds
with a pocketknife

dry heat
a hawk corkscrews
the sky

sunset
smoke from a fire
beyond the hill

rumble of the sea
against the headlands 
a fray in my cuff

curtains flutter
the shadows of birds
rising in waves

empty cowshed
a little bird drinks
water from the pail

just alive
enough for flickers
the old cottonwood

dusk moon
a child’s ball bobs
on the ebb tide

cousteau museum 
on the exotic fish
our family’s grin

winter doldrums
up to her elbows
in potting soil

broken iris
every vase
looks wrong

scent of lilacs
the chalk ledge full
of small pieces

mosquitoes
the slap of feet
in the dojo

meditation 
a hickory nut
hits the skylight

snowcaps
clouds of breath
above the herd

sunshine
through the river’s haze
white butterflies

alley windows
laundry and gossip
pass back and forth

a spider crawls
from the bonsai pot 
cello notes

a new day
how to translate
this talk of crows

deep in the forest
deep in the night
cuckoo

vs of geese 
i look where everyone else
is looking

halloween snow
the yeti’s
tiny footprints

indian summer 
we ride around town
just to be riding

that butterfly
i thought was a dead leaf 
indian summer

my eye my mind
led into the woods
by the red sumac

half moon
the white cat vanishes
into shadow

pink cosmos 
my divorced friend
learns to salsa

full moon
shadows ripple through
the field of catnip

snow glare 
the scent of lotion
on a pair of sunglasses

hazy dawn
a skunk’s white stripe
blends with the daisies

chinese new year 
daring to call my sister
a monkey

miles of beach
the sudden urge
to run

walking off anger
johnny-jump-ups
exactly mid-path

almost spring
noseprints
on every window

sunbeams
the toddler sticks his finger
in a daffodil

sea mist burning off 
a sandpiper glides by
on blurred legs

formal garden 
dog-toothed violets
loose on the lawn

yesterday’s rain 
another butterfly changes
the size of the blossom

daylight savings 
the glimmer of a penny
in the sand

first star 
a tiny crab climbs out
of the sand castle

the mourning dove’s head
turns backward so easily
cool of the evening

the old magnolia
a southern drawl
to my death poem

deep night sky 
the car radio
between stations

spring fever
a new notch
on the tomcat’s ear

incoming tide
a hermit crab wanders
among empty shells

spring dusk
a black sheep
joins the flock

his passing 
the whiteness of sheets
filled by the breeze

faint stars
i wonder what yu chang
is doing tonight

tipping back
my whiskey glass
the moon

lower and higher
higher but not sure
first spring peeper

an iv tube
caught in sunlight
daffodils

spring fever
mule ears gee and haw
above the pickup’s slats

passing laundry
between a flutter of sheets
bob bob white

making way
for the power lines 
a divided maple

the smell
of root-bearing earth
these restless hands

rustle of wind
among the rhododendrons
feather-fluffing wren

just as i decide
what kind of bird it is 
its call

sweltering day 
little grasshoppers jump
ahead of the scythe

autumn colors
seeping into the mist 
water down my collar

funeral day
his old umbrella
won’t open

winter twilight
an arc of crows
echoes the mountain

dwindling fire 
our conversation shifts
to death

midnight stars 
the kitten warm
in my sweater

chapel in the rain 
the lift of white doves
against blackened stones

winter twilight
the shadowed hill
beyond the hill

her placenta
beneath an oak sapling
first star

prison vigil
cold gusts keep blowing out
the candles

all the frogs
in the snakes’ aquarium
staring at the sun

soft rain
an earthworm
stretches its pink

silvered leaves
the sound of a jet
inside the rain

just long enough
to leave an impression
dragonfly

rejection letter
i walk at dawn
past barking dogs

blazing heat
a homeless woman
wishes me a good day

summer morning 
the mockingbird sings
a song from my youth

the damp pavement
around each puddle
summer dusk

moonless night
a ladybug husk
down the drain

blue sky morning 
sweeping a cobweb
off the clothesline

cliff dust
cicadas saw
through the heat

last kiss
the smell of hay
in her hair

pleiades at dawn 
his hand comes to rest
on the small of my back

long train journey 
a man brings on
the smell of autumn

new moon
the possum’s posthumous
grin

raindrops
snaking down the pine bark 
his rough hands

meteor shower 
digging my toes deeper
into the sand

morning train 
a few notes of birdsong
through the closing door

home
for dad’s funeral 
not the same quiet in the kitchen

new patterns
on the wallpaper 
autumn dawn

lingering fog 
a tent caterpillar
drops out

the heat 
two old men argue
over a parking space

slow drift of the river
splashes of sunlight
from a moorhen’s back

whispers
the hummingbird’s tongue
ripples the nectar

roadhouse
a patched screen door
squeaks us through

thieves’ moon
salt on tomatoes
from the neighbor’s vine

third inning
a shot over the wall
raises a dove

a skull no bigger
than my thumbnail
jasmine in bloom

chappaquiddick
a water strider
crosses the pond

alder stump 
an inch worm arches across
1984

despite everything
her dog wags its tail
when we meet

sagging cedar rail
wind works its way
through the bluestem

gathering heat 
my throat
no longer firm

deadlines
an ice cream truck’s song
in the distance

gettysburg
traffic backed up
to the interstate

campfire circle
a friend’s back
leans against mine

above the cries of
hey batter batter
a meadowlark

songwriter’s lunchbreak 
a dishrag muffles
the windchimes

swelter
a cat watches traffic
from the long grass

summer grasses
the lakota sings
of a white buffalo

first firefly
my wife and i share
our fortunes

wild flowers 
i brush mosquitoes
from the camera lens

lingering heat
the actress i had a crush on
in playboy

a gray cubicle 
cicada songs
through a speaker phone

evening crickets
star by star
the dipper appears

moonlit pasture
my shadow
chirps

midsummer sun
facing the mountain
i’ll never climb

plunge of coolness 
the piebald mare and i
slide apart in the creek

too hot to move
the crickets
cricket

fireflies
my son writes his name
with a sparkler

tonight’s stars
the stilt-walker talks about
his youth

wandering
where there is no path
a flicker’s salmon-pink tail

father’s day
the height
of the lighthouse

making plans
conch shell pressed
to my ear

river breeze
the faint clang of a ringer
on the other bank

sunlit creek
my discarded walking stick
passes me

a new neighbor 
the feel of sand
on a smooth shell

a surfer’s sea
my footprints deep
in the sand

children running
the aged nun’s wimple
flows in the wind

iced tea 
the scent of lemon grass
from her scarf

the downpour ends
much discussion inside
the balsam fir

rumors 
a hillside
of kudzu

back to school
the bitter end
of the cucumber

family album 
the cherry branches in bloom
now bare

the sheep too
were always here
standing stones

evening star
the skiff’s wake whispers
in the reeds

still some song
in the four strings left 
summer’s end

sabbath morning
the transfigured face
of the shaped-note singer

the day after
the family reunion
visiting graves

earthquake season 
the moth orchid
begins to flutter

handshake 
our sleeves touched
by the autumn wind

drifting hawk
soccer players surge
down the field

my solitary life
a path worn around
the lotus pond

night winds
rake the pond leaves 
wobbly moon

so suddenly winter
the colors
in her pill box

a stiffness in the joints
shrunken tomatoes
piled in the turnrow

rain so heavy
it calms the water
autumn evening

cold drizzle
one of the sparrows
sits apart

frosted windows 
my weight
still on the gym scale

pond ice
the fixed eyes
of the decoy

home from vacation
houseflies find
the open door

a new school year 
one long blast
of the bus driver’s horn

fall migration
streaks of purple loosestrife
through the marsh

evening glories 
should i complain about my life
like hisajo?

she lets go of my hand
the stars
without a constellation

family reunion
patches of fog
on the horizon

drought’s end 
a boatman’s song starts
the wadi babbling

fossil stone
skipping it
the same

graveside
my father and i
find common ground

almost soundless
the slowing stream
heavy with autumn

late summer
the water
in one ear

ikebana
the space
where the lily was

moonrise
over marshlands 
the hissing geese

full moon
shadow on shadow
of prickly pears

her grave
the names of flowers
escape me

rain-soaked turf
echo of a gull’s cry
blurs against the hill

a final bulb
the warmth of garden soil
just after sunset

standing naked
in the moonlight 
the taste of a nashi pear

cemetery 
the scent of muskmelon
from the next hill

hopscotch grid
faintly visible
first stars

midday hush
the rasp of a mallard
calling his mate

a heart-shaped pebble
if you hold it just right 
our first days apart

winter rain
who am i
to the cat?

darkening sky
snowflakes soundless
against the garden chime

winter evening 
my newly divorced friend
hogs the cat

a magnolia leaf
falls between us
tenor sax

restless pigeons 
gentle words from a clerk
bring a hint of tears

dead hamster 
my son invents
a religion

cold winter night
the scent from fireplaces
all the way home

lunar eclipse
the primal beat of techno
from a passing car

such heat
the weight
of the cat’s breath

storm front
a splinter of obsidian
between my fingers

lengthening shadows
a stray dog
joins the picnic

beach stones
the sun’s warmth
fills my hand

twilight
a yellow canoe
drifts across the bay

sultry day
the time it takes
to detach a tick

class reunion
everybody loved
my wife

reunion photo
my long shadow
joins the family

harbor sunset 
lovers stroll
in reflected light

snap of a twig
the egret’s neck
extends

cat’s faint tread 
the light
before sunrise

first day of school
the latin teacher
coated in chalk

continent’s edge 
a mound of jellyfish
the color of twilight

shooting star 
a night bird
cries out

roaring sea 
blue anemones
along the path

meditation hour
the rain
changing rhythm

a strange language
these querulous crows
and no peace anywhere

full moon 
a shadow under the curl
of each wave

morning wind
shadows of gulls
skim the dunes

breakwater rocks 
where i left off yesterday
the morning tide

the hang time
of grasshoppers
lazy afternoon

invisible door
the orphan opens it
for his brother

summer night
the store owner buys something
from his own machine

flickering light
on a vase of wildflowers 
sound of the wind

midsummer 
childhood pathways
lost to wildflowers

gaunt children
selling old bayonets 
noonday sun

evening cool 
my two small images
in the cat’s eyes

shimmering fireflies
the overgrown field
since father’s illness

woodland stroll
the same bird call
always just ahead

sunny rain 
color of finches
matching the leaves

ebb tide
the sand castle moat
still showing clouds

seaside cafe
the wind ripples
my oyster soup

again negotiations fail
the clay path broken
by a mushroom

our first meeting 
a snowflake melts
on my lips

bedtime story
my grandfather’s fingers
touching the braille

morning sun 
fish scales glisten
in the otter scat

his passing 
the magenta chrysanthemum
still fresh

end of twilight
duck wings whistle
above the path

tracings of snow
on the forest boughs 
a horned owl’s face

icy wind
the garbage can rolls
back and forth

departure day
the car covered
with pollen

easter afternoon 
the sides of a dairy cow
heave in labor

mother’s day
that first breath of air
outside the door

fly fishing 
the frog
too

memorial day
in the moment of silence
a mourning dove

spring morning
we argue about crab apple
and cherry blossoms

leaving the paddock
the color of dandelions
coming with me

spring afternoon 
even the river stones
turning green

memorial day
cut flowers lie
in ranks of white

cattails bursting
a red rowboat tangled
in willow branches

the old cat rubs
her nose in the french lavender
morning dew

misty morning
the young heron's feet
spring green

careful steps
rocking the boat
rocking the top of the ocean

almost dusk
an open door
to the lighthouse

the lagoon egret
sound of clothes
washed on stones

towering pines
a bobcat prowls
in the early mist

clearing sky
a young gull
tests the wind

the last telephone pole
a herring gull perched
on one leg

day in the park
finding a cherry blossom
in the baby's diaper

scarlet sunset
a fighting cock's feathers
ruffle in the breeze

first light
pulling nightcrawlers
from the mud

the wing-pulse
of a shiny wasp
heat waves

wet sand
a crab comes up
out of the moon

a skiff
broken loose
wild flowers

summer grasses
the trail upstream
into tomorrow

morning sun
the shine
on a buttercup

the polished surface
a white heron hesitates
to put its foot down

blazing heat
my long shadow
useless

a trout erupts
through iridescent ripples
summer sunset

home from the funeral
finding the cat
in with his shoes

defunct nursery
every dead flower
with a marker

twilight breeze
stench from the horse
that pulls the carriage

getting to know the pine
clotted resin
on the seat of my pants

late afternoon
a breeze sweeping
home plate

fallen rose petals
a japanese beetle tries
to right itself

hollows in the rock
where their knees were

by candlelight

offers me a ride

in the willows

from the eaves

to cross the lake

written overnight

from the practice room

wears a puppy's face

under the ice

snowed in
a silverfish
in my teacup

on the shovel

calling asylum inmates
hazy moon

on the stage

of my scar

finally comes out

nesting in the marsh grass
she takes my hand

we wade into the current
of a great river

by the statue
of the polar explorer
lingering snow

the blind girl drinks
with cupped hands

where the tree was
spring runoff

butterflies
throughout the meadow
gypsy music

depth of winter
rubbing more face cream
into my crow's-feet

even the dog
holds her water

at the back of the greenhouse
withered poinsettias

springtime

over and over

in and out of shadow

about the birds

from the horses

in the ocean

drifts toward shore

the falling ashes
from a distant wildfire

to the driveway

magnify a leaf vein
my heartbeat

the cows are browsing
frost

twilight lingers
from the wrecking yard
flash of a blowtorch

wind blown leaves
caught by the brush pile

a wobbly wheel
on the shopping cart
autumn night

deep in the hollow
coolness along the stream

morning mist
the tick tick
of leaves falling

new year's eve
flash of a firework
through the wool curtain

january dawn
i scatter rock salt
from where i've landed

the paraplegic's gaze
climbing bare branches
with the jay

the rest home seniors
come to life

of her paintbrush

dry roses
on the secretary's desk

tries to smile

with the snow

back up the tree

into itself

in the raven's breast

taller and closer

in the overhead lamp

bringing the laundry in
stiff

the cough from a stubbled face
in the soup line

icy road
a cloud covers the moon
in the dead deer's eyes

the haunted house
now painted yellow

winter dusk
fog flowing up
the dry canal

now and then the wind
through the ponderosa pines
billows of pollen

of a giant saguaro
afterglow

summer rain
the shape of the birthmark
on her shoulder

a lone inmate
on the prison grounds
summer rain

track meet
a few grains of sand
in the drinking fountain

lingering heat
the taste of hibiscus tea
on his lips

fragrant evening
she thumbs through glossy pages
without reading

constant drizzle
bride-to-be oscillating
between yes and no

a tick on new grass extends
both front legs

shooting star
what do fish
see at night?

grown overnight
in the city square
a christmas tree

two crows working
the twilight crosswinds
my pregnant wife

patches of sky
the ship's waves sink
into the ocean

freezing cold
the crow leaves
with a caw

white puffs
from the police whistle

an extension cord dangles
in falling snow

flying in place

beneath the ginkgo

of river ice

at home

down the tree-house slide

on his distance

scatters the waxwings
new year's day

jazz
in the long cool evening
the sound of geese leaving

easter stars
a rising chorus
of treefrogs

redwing blackbirds
vie for the tallest stalk
spring wind

adrift
between ice floes
april sun

peace officers' memorial
the empty slots
for future names

the secret she tells
a wave opens
over the headland

through the stillness

in another life i wore
a braided pigtail

the sweet alyssum
between my grandparents' graves

the canoe's shadow rocks
on the river

through open windows
he lifts the veil

in the rusty tub

the peony
that never bloomed

shadowy steps
climbing towards the sound
of a shakuhachi

grass gone to seed
tiny brown moths flicker
about my ankles

thins in the sun
a swan emerges

his arthritis
guiding the hoe
late tomatoes

a towhee calls
from the seldom-used gate

rustle of bamboo
the steady pace of oxen
hauling fruit

hiroshima day
a cat pokes and pokes
a cicada shell

cloudy afternoon
a chrysanthemum blooms
in the paper-folder's hand

wet summer night
one neighbor's cigarette
joins another

apple peelings
a slow drip
the rain left

summer veranda
into an open notebook
a few unknown seeds

chemo again
trying not to notice
the lawn's brown spots

afterglow
a white heron vanishes
in the rising fog

rain on the roof
my breath stirs a cobweb
in the corner

autumn rain
a face in a window
behind rivulets

spring sky
a pair of ravens
owning it

muddy barnyard
the old farmer waltzing
with a wayward cow

pruning old roses
the taste of blood
on my tongue

water strider
the wake
of an oar

creek crossing
the uneven footing
on the other side

breezy afternoon
making a kite again
after many years

nature preserve
encircling its marker
an endangered plant

a rest by the stream
burrs on the tongue
of my tennis shoe

a row of canoe paddles
hanging on a rail
evening stillness

heat lightning
the first drop of sweat
on her chin

echo of a bell
a monk checks his step
over a garden snail

open window
the neighbor's parrot answers
my oven timer

dawn
a vee of goslings swims
toward the moon

wipers wiping
slush from the windshield
radio love song

a slug trail
moonlight
streaks my shoe

pink clouds!
so hot the morning
the circus arrives

afternoon bath
the mockingbird echoes
a thrush

fumbling
to unlock the door
winter stars

summer solstice
a climbing rose
bent with blossoms

trailhead poppies
but today
with butterflies

a reed hangs
from the swan's beak
hot afternoon

the children pause
to watch a dove

summer afternoon
nuns giggle
in a dim corridor

early sunrise
pink bindweed curled
around barley stalks

river bend
the slow move
of an eddy

independence day
slowly the clouds
drift upstream

blazing sun
the shape of her legs
through a thin summer dress

summer school
papier-mche pigs
sunning on the deck

crowing cockerel
the black cat takes
her morning wash

pieces
of a robin's egg
i look up

green tips of jonquils
grandpa changes the oil
in the lawn mower

memorial day
the light blue sky
crowded with clouds

baby spiders
swarm around a knothole
summer drizzle

tai chi class
breathing deeply
downwind of the narcissus

gentle rain
pigeons murmuring
under the eaves

day's end
a bit of clover
floats in the bath

glacial stream
shadows of dragonflies
pass over the bridge

a doe and two fawns
mid-street
my hand motions go ahead

standing in the brook 
painted toenails
lure a turtle

steep trail
a wild rose catches
my breath

idle afternoon
the deepening hole beneath
the woodpecker’s beak

storm lull
freshly crumpled paper
creaks twice

porch swing
the occasional drip
of gathering dew

first phlox
a dewdrop on the tip
of my nose

crevasse
my shadow’s head
disappears

storm clouds roil
across the prairie
she marks her place

from childhood
the firefly jar 
light hair in it

false dawn
a ruffed grouse drums
the woods awake

rocky portage
someone familiar
in the stranger’s face

summer afternoon
the boys tell stories
about someday

wild oats

at the donkey’s feet

a farmer studies
the roof thatch

dust cloud
the dump truck weighed down
with wilderness

elbow deep
in a cold stream
fool’s gold

thesis
the sounds of childhood
through my study window

summer meadow 
awaking to a crowd
of cows

only a chimney
and dust of adobe bricks
yellow roses

long afternoon
the peanut vendor’s bell
jingles in another street

spring breeze 
the smell of new tires
from the bike shop

little loose cloud
and the blue balloon
finding each other

clinic appointment
i stop
to pet pussy willows

white marble
i am small at the feet
of lincoln

snarled traffic
a mosquito buzzes
in my ear

spring landscape
a water colorist’s brush
tints the stream

fragrant irises
the boy asks
where babies come from

the chorus
before the cranes
spring sky

spring ends
the old acacia
remains leafless

anemones
shedding petals in the stream 
wind-streaked clouds

insomnia
the break-up
moth by moth

my neighbor’s bicycle
locked to the fence 
drifting plum petals

idle conversation 
swallow shadows
crisscross the sand

spring twilight
buds of water lilies
still submerged

evening rain
the deaf dog sleeps
with a paw on my foot

the cool breeze
between spadefuls of gravel
a nightingale’s song

childhood garden 
scent of the magnolia
that once stood here

cattail slough
a slight seepage
in the weave of tracks

tea garden
the dr doolittle in me
whispers to a turtle

a field of crickets
stepping in the spaces
between their songs

summer heat
the grin on the face
of my neighbor’s dog

distant thunder 
the scolded girl
steps on every crack

the gift pen
runs out of ink 
summer rainstorm

lingering heat 
out of a small shop
the smell of the past

turning over a beetle
in the corn maze

almost ripe
the pineapple that was
so hard to draw

a week of rain 
peppermint drops
fused in a clump

cambodian sunset
children bathe
in the brown river

stonehenge 
the druid arrives
in his psychedelic car

postal form 
the gift value of a bottle
of empty cicadas

first warm spell 
i gaze into the sky
where the shuttle streaked

our neighbor sings 
spring snow melts
into the muskeg

rain
a cup of chamomile tea
and the tale of genji

cherry blossoms
today the courage
to speak to her

sweet breeze
the quince tree flutters
with red parrots

spring breakup
my missing button
in her sewing box

water sounds
my memory wanders the coast
of a summer lake

kitchen mop-up 
the peace of moving out
in widening arcs

telling it
like it is
one black crow

bird watching 
naked boys in the canal
make a pose

rainy darkness
in the cobbled street
the blind beggar

childhood home
she spins maple seeds
off the front porch

summer's end
my children try to teach me
how to smile

cantaloupes for sale
the farm girl's eyes
over her newspaper

geese winding south
yellowjackets buzz
the empty barbecue

building a puzzle
three days
of rain

last day together
a boat breaks up
our reflections

the call of wild geese
a field of pale goldenrod
leaning southward

new love
still some green
in these autumn leaves

fall migration
the phone lines busy
gathering birds

family reunion 
wild turkeys
among the headstones

late day shadows 
the gravedigger hangs his coat
over the stone angel

poised for prayer 
the bonsai pine
in its tiny pot

the corner
where nothing grows 
moonlight

raw wind
and right on cue
the scrawny dog that limps

hazy afternoon
hedge trimmers ratchet up
the cicada frenzy

my friend’s wake
a bookshelf labeled
to be read

opening the door
to let the old dog out
moonlight on my toes

a foot of snow 
the cat out loving and
where is the garden buddha?

i fail to become
a swan

sandstorm
the scent of rain
from somewhere

a week of rain
into the stranger’s yawn
a train whistle

comes through the wheat

from living room corners

between concrete cracks

to the stars

a crumb
in an old book

menses

crossing the tide flats
in someone’s footprints

among the stones

geese flow backwards
with the swollen tide

windless day 
kissing snowflakes
on her hair

the faded strike zone
on the schoolhouse

an abalone shell
too deep to reach

snowflakes vanish
into dark water

playing chess 
a crow lands
on a patch of snow

winter thaw
the neighbor throws toys
back across the fence

first fine day
a mother and her baby
babble back and forth

fruit-cellar coolness
mama pits cherries
with a paperclip

my hopes
just so high

and the cat’s meow
the color of twilight

in the new bedroom
wisteria

soft rain
hopscotch pebble
in a puddle

special guest
moving the cherrywood bowl
into sunlight

summer rain 
her kimono tied
loosely

she asks me
if i love her 
evening star

summer begins 
the sound of a stick
dragged across a fence

cabin fever
i spin the child’s globe
until it blurs blue

fallen leaves
slide over the spillway
another daydream

folding and unfolding
umbrellas

the shadow of a bird
darts into the bedroom

rusted plow
a few husks of cotton
left in the field

playing with its food

glows

in falling leaves

ears

in a shadow box

by origami cranes

meeting a hummingbird
on the way to the bath
my nakedness

scuba diving
cloud shadows
on the coral

the day’s last sunlight
drips away

nightfall
prairie wind
rattles roadside reflectors

in the dark
the mountain
loses its name

noon heat 
moving grass
swings the sky

giggles of children
the golden retriever
shakes off the river

honeysuckle 
the silent flight of fruit bats
above the river

ring of mountains
elders walk the drum beat
around a fire pit

autumn moon
everything i own
fits in the canoe

sunlit meadow 
fritillaries
just frittering

a lizard tail
released in my pinched fingers
the scent of thyme

the pregnant woman
shifts on the bleachers
extra innings

scent of roses 
the healer’s hands
grow warmer

one bug zap
at a time

on her way to the groom
scent of rose

with a rubber spider

into a chimney

and tinkling ice

i close
and lock

from its case

on a park bench

since morning

a waft of burnt insect
from the halogen bulb

my childhood
before my eyes

stars appear
a flower vendor
stringing jasmine

thunderclap
a blue reflection
in the dog's brown eyes

finding a way
through the forest
winter sunlight

horned owl
near the window
a curtain inhales

first morning
dunking the last
of the homemade bread

overcast sky
adding more driftwood
to the bird blind

cry of the killdeer
river stones
worn smooth

falling snow quiets
the final hour

wee hours
the leaves on the roof
shift again

from the swimming pool

winter morning
a ring of cattails
holds the mist

left in our mailbox

the beach umbrella man
packs up to leave

mile after mile
of barbed wire
wind in the sage

woodpecker
the higher pitch
of a hickory

rows of corn dancers
the black-and-white smile
of a pueblo clown

lost in reeds
a bittern points the way
to the morning moon

summer ending
a dry wind weaves
the willows together

river reverie
cottonwood leaves shimmer
in the autumn breeze

alive in dreams

of my face

between

for the wind to rustle

in the mist
snowflakes

onto the bridge

against their poles

the fly caught beneath
a wine glass

into a mussel bed

the herring gull’s
pink legs

the longest day
slowly the cat
licks each paw

thunder
the white side
of the leaves

a gull slips
on the polished handrail
rolling thunder

beachcomber
grains of sand fill
her smile lines

leaving for home 
strands of seaweed wrap
around our ankles

under the tangy sea scent
odors of decay

the sea

and finding the sky

at the cliff’s edge

at a neighbor’s house

with cut flowers

on a pan of brownies

and sniffs

from the sky

dying
in birdsong

shakes the shack

warm rain 
nevertheless

to the freeway

knows where he’s going

of the old fence

never come

i never met

in the pasta sauce

for every shell

through grandfather’s journal

on my cat’s fur

in her sun hat
gardening she hums
our song

of queen anne’s lace

in polish

touches mine

and goes

on the hardwood floor

the minute hand
stuck in place

in the hawk’s beak

on the schoolhouse lawn

she shows me
the blackberry patch

on another’s back

in the sink

of her wrist

for all the stars

of ten-grain bread

white walls
white pills
another day

sewing machine

a young woman smiles
from the hair dye box

even out of doors
i want to go out

daffodil shoots
underneath a bandage
the cut begins to itch

valentine’s day
his dog drops driftwood
at my feet

breaking the ice
i tell the cattle
it is almost spring

last days of winter 
a jumble of tarnished silver
on the sideboard

older suburb
woven through
with wild plum blossom

as i reflect
on growing old
daffodils!

the buds forming
at the scars

seed catalogs 
garden plans grow around
a toad house

open crocuses
wind lifts the feathers
on a starling’s throat

her third birthday
tulips bend
under a light snow

waking up
not alone
cherry blossoms

as it stretches
back to preen the sinews
of a swan’s neck

ants working late
in the afternoon sun
a drifting contrail

the milky way 
a glowworm reaches
the tip of a rose

work loose

deep in summer
the river over and under
my hair

on the sergeant’s grave
a wild jackrabbit
nibbling grass

cabbage butterfly
floating in the breeze

the sharp edge
of the spur

my grandsons bare
their chests

of your white hands

over my tea

between father
and son

of the sea urchin

again in the mix 
mockingbird

no one calls
she gently dusts
her porcelain rabbits

between us

a bug
cleans its antennae

secrets escape through
open windows

an acorn
topples a king

new friends work on
old problems

the child
blowing on a pinwheel 
the wind blowing on her

cracked soil
a day laborer bent
over his shadow

distant thunder
a revolutionary cannon
green with age

summer night
a smoker’s cough and the clack
of mahjong tiles

sitting on the hill
of mom’s pregnant belly
the lego castle

my kinfolk
don’t say a lot
hemlocks all around

wildfire
vultures circling
the outer thermal

blue violets
the coolness of evening
ascending the mountain

birdsong
the neighbor’s light on
at 3 am

sunrise 
the new calf fumbles
at an udder

morning commute
sprinklers soaking
the strawberry fields

dense fog
the train evaporates
into a distant horn

first swallow
the calm of dawn
slips away

low sun 
a wren’s song
spirals

coats dripping rain 
we discuss
our addictions

first day of spring
children risk marbles
on the playground

chore time
the boy ties his kite
to the scarecrow

palm sunday
the birdwatcher
tiptoes out of church

prairie grass
a mustang runs
with the wind

memorial day
his name her reflection
in black granite

easter eggs 
the multicolored faces
of the children

late for church
from an open barn door
the lowing of cows

blue-eyed grass
she asks
if i love her

in his woodshop
my father is lost
in the grain pattern

new home 
orienting myself
to the sun

first light
the beachcomber
begins his rounds

graduation day 
we hold hands more tightly
as our son’s name is called

my baby’s sigh
the last colors
of sunset

negotiations 
the butterfly’s wings
open and close

what should have been said 
how the sand pulls
from under my feet

temple grounds 
one finch
feeds another

white butterflies
lost in the barley
lost in the wheat

long day
the lizard’s hind leg
stretched too far

race weekend
the worn paths
to the restrooms

scent of rain 
all the ways
we failed each other

the cool kids
walk arm-in-arm
wild narcissus

awash with fog
the wheel-less
wheelbarrow

pacing myself
to the trot of the dog
an april evening

spring sunshine
the friendliness of the girl
who serves me

first warm day
the bodybuilder
makes his pecs dance

end of winter
i place a phone call
to another time

redwood sorrel buds
beyond the missing bridge
the vanishing trail

early morning sun
steam rises from stumps
piled in the clear-cut

easter egg hunt
grandma hints where
the purple one lies

a long road
the spring wind
in my lungs

the sigh
i heave
forsythia

visiting artists
all over town
cherry blossoms

spring morning 
women at a village well
tease the new bride

steady drizzle
strand by strand
a robin’s nest

a female mallard
leads two drakes 
spring morning

once again
the scent of lilacs
mother’s call to supper

downpour
puddles swirled
with pollen

spring breeze 
the cat bats a few
feathers around

mortgage paid off 
thatch from our yard
in the robin’s beak

sunlit dew
the cock pheasant circles
his three-strong harem

spring afternoon
the schoolchildren return
to the dead squirrel

evensong
an upturned snail shell
brimming with rain

cardinal pair
the girl i never asked
to the high school dance

a spider comes out
to bundle its catch
evening rain

spring sun
her urn gathers
the whole family

a drifting cloud
the line of frog eggs
twitches

fado love song
dust bunnies swirl
ahead of the broom

first of spring
the mail carrier’s
knees

mother’s day
one set of footprints
along the beach

hands
on the balcony rails
summer morning

winter aquarium 
maybe i should have stayed
in my home town

sun in the pines
the awkward cadence
of father’s voice

alone at the beach 
cones of bent pines
so low to the ground

snow moon
the blue shadow
of a bare birch

ice storm
he traces my scars
in the dark

snowbound 
collecting rent
on boardwalk

fading light
my snow shovel’s scrape
answers another

deep winter
rooks call other rooks
through the dusk

sketch pad
no color
for snow

late night
sounds this house makes
only in the winter

winter sunrise
blinking
between the boxcars

storage closet
the dead spider
as fine as its web

waiting
for the rice to boil
winter moon

woodburning stove 
toiled boots
prop each other up

winter noon
a branch drips
on its shadow

snowed in
opening the lid
of my breadmaker

last of the sun 
the letter of apology
half written

winter sunrise
the crack
in the barn door

a clump of soil
shaped by his grip 
late winter sun

snowmelt
a raspberry cane
springs back

afternoon stillness
a dragonfly touching
circles in the pond

swallowing
an iron pill 
autumn melancholy

log fire
the landlord’s
reindeer nose

passing headlights
snow gathers on
the horse’s back

crocuses bloom
the old woman on the bench
swings her feet

the bonfire embers
smoulder on to sundown
honking geese

the empty barrel
still smells of apples
november snow

evening snowstorm
a tinful
of unsharpened pencils

two crows
into a headwind
skittering leaves

old dog gets up
just to lie back down
end of winter

tire marks
on the neighborhood street
evening heat

hot summer day
the shape of a bicycle
that’s been run over

one tree
downhill from the others
the limit of shadows

watermelon moon
she pedals slower
closer to home

drive-thru exit
a one-legged gull waits
to take my order

heat wave
a crow follows
the train tracks

midsummer heat 
prayer flags fade
on temple trees

summer waters
the slack
in each line

lingering twilight
a water dragon’s tail
dangles in the pool

midnight 
another ping from
the empty pop can

trying to make
myself understood 
the sun in a spoon

a length of rope
knotted with seaweed 
pull of the tide

moonlight swim 
i sink in my shadow
and come up in his

a small cave
only children’s footprints
on the sandy floor

wakened by rain
the scent
of bruised mint

ulysses butterfly 
the satisfaction
of knowing its name

amusement park
odors melding
with the sea

vacation whodunit
the perforated shadow
of my straw hat

wave after wave
no one i knew
as a child remains

still
no answer
the stars

halloween
she asks to borrow
my hippie jeans

timber train
a thought about
auschwitz

behind our backs 
the sounds the ocean
covers up

evening news
she files her nails
down to nothing

the sound she makes
when she catches her breath
first snow

babar
a forget-me-not
between wrinkled pages

an eagle sighting 
the frailty
in my father’s hug

slow driver 
is he watching
the hawk?

dust clearing
the miner’s lamp beam catches
on a splintered timber

open range
leather creaks
in the cold dawn

rain turning snow
the doctor begins by describing
treatable conditions

geese
that stay 
winter rain

office windowsill
a geranium petal
drops into a file

cold moon 
marrow bones simmer
in the pot

hospice hallway
his visitors talk about
someone else

funeral
the wind
hushes the priest

first winter rain
i drift into dreams
of my childhood

giving up
her secret ingredient
last round of scrabble

quiet fall of snow
the park mime’s wall
is breached

still morning
birds on the roof ridge
every which way

equinox 
splitting the last tomato
with a jackknife

high autumn days
the morning glories open
to whatever comes

a couple kissing
not even moonlight
between them

the drift
of a nearby conversation
autumn leaves

full moon 
her updated version
of the future

dawn frost
a screech owl finishes
the hunt

one corner then the other
of my book 
black-tip dragonfly

edge of the reeds
a rattlesnake pair
tails whispering

new love
the ripples of a braid
undone

memories 
the smell of matches
fills the kitchen

bayside picnic
trying to favour
the one-legged gull

family reunion
memories of the way
it never was

old friends
a rustle of pea pods
against the fence

beach festival
a child pats the damp
in her castle wall

from the lookout
mountain after mountain
ant on the gravel path

heat storm
the weight of his hand
almost touching mine

the secluded creek
of our childhood
still deep in places

summer ice
the shopkeeper
bangs his scoop

a flip-flop
in the middle of the street
the heat

starless night
i crush the emptiness
from a soda can

missing steeple 
crows settle
in a hemlock tree

the horned moon 
a grub in one hand
a seed in the other

frozen morning
a pansy’s blue face
in the leaf litter

spring 
the pause before
she pulls a sapling

the sidewalk ends
at a high stone wall
dandelions

tea house
a small leaf
blackens a tooth

apples in bud
a white lie
about her complexion

heirloom seeds
a young woman kneels
in the garden

first warm day
she asks me if i still
want a divorce

my downed kite 
following its string
to a stranger’s door

early dusk
an inch of snow
on a half inch branch

a dancer
all her life 
winter moon

bare branches
a swishing broom
finds its rhythm

dwarfed by dinosaur skeletons
a teen
with all the answers

science fair
my amaryllis bigger
than his

storm over 
her headstone
above the snow

church bells and snow
i read that chekhov
longed to be a monk

winter drizzle 
a sprinkling of sea salt
on warm pretzels

the crows
louder than usual
deep morning mist

i’d almost forgotten it
a seed’s hunger
for the sun

beginning of summer 
the heart of the watermelon
saved for last

oppressive heat 
a road crew rakes hay
over grass seeds

dry thunder
the sound of sparrows
in sunflowers

church picnic 
grass butterflies stirred up
by my skirt hem

ebb tide
the curve of the beach
brighter

grand canyon
all i know
i don’t know

vedic chants
a heron glides to a rock
in the misty lake

high-tension wires
hum above the prairie
a few drifting clouds

the smell
of a crushed beetle
things that don’t change

midlife
my car radio
on scan

morning lotus 
the pool umbrellas
still closed

into the sun
where eyes can’t follow
a red tailed hawk

drought
the prayers she knows
by heart

farmer’s market 
an earwig burrows
into the pennies

broken clouds 
he rearranges
the squirrel shield

warm winds
the kite’s string
almost straight

southern breeze 
a goldfinch drinks
from the air conditioner

nearly twilight
the blowsy petals
of spent tulips

jasmine 
first the perfume
then the buzz

red-tailed hawk
sunlight warms a thicket
of mesquite

spring noon
the construction crane
lifts a crow

sparrow fledglings
the old man points
his walking stick

spring sun
an unfinished word
on the to-do list

tidal surge
the shag’s wings open
for the wind to dry

a second plowing 
the black mud
lit up by egrets

distant peak
a tumbleweed overtakes
the shadow of a cloud

we pick
the last blackberries
her freshly blonde hair

book chosen
another title tips
into the empty space

waking up all night
this room is too close
to the moon

listening
for the cat door 
autumn night

lakeside drive
one more time around
the radio dial

cul-de-sac
the knife-grinder rings in
summer’s end

almost dark 
a fountain
lifts the rain

silence between us
the sound
of a candle

wind-carved sand
i crumble a bayberry leaf
to bring her back

where night
pulls away 
white irises

humming oldies
talk of the future
from the back seat

thumbing a coat
over my shoulder
cloudless sky

distant thunder
she draws teardrops
on her doll’s face

enough sunrise 
a small window
in an old hotel

starlit sky
cicadas’ keening sounds
surround us

the cat
right where i left him
haloed moon

cicada dusk 
trouble in the sound
of my mother’s voice

leaves turning
she still smiles when she sees me
after all these years

barbed wire
sagging under its load
of bare vines

new wine
adobe walls
in shadow

moon moth
infant fingers brush
the breast

the hush
after starlings lift
autumn sun

sweetness
oozing from a fig
indian summer

the first bare trees
a flock of blackbirds
turns back the clock

half moon
a firefly pulsing
in my shadow’s heart

light rain
the red rose
overflows

august heat 
broken egg shells
in the gator’s nest

seashells 
i sort through
my childhood

salt water taffy
a long line of cars on the bridge
heading back

lavender field 
stopping my car
to let the bee out

sunlit riffle 
overhead the osprey clutches
a wet gleam

withering blossoms 
clay takes shape
on the potter’s wheel

vj day
an old man with a balloon
tied to his chair

end of summer
tumbleweed trapped
in barbwire

billowing clouds
trailing the tractor
windrows of hay

chatter
in the outfield
katydids

evening shadows 
a crow
this side of the haze

new girl at school
maple pods
twirling endlessly

the river of heaven
my body
drifts away

a gang of men
followed by others
the ripe grain

august night
the crack of the bat
sends a chill

moonlight
on my hands
the smell of parsnips

starlit sky
a touch of dampness
on the scarecrow

autumn in the park
a soprano saxophone
merges with the night

the wide blue sky
following behind
an orange tractor

purple almond tree 
today i’ll not forget
where i parked the car

all the answers
in the back of the book

over a shallow part

with the chickens

of a swallowtail

from the erasers

on the toilet soap

lower their weapons

from gate to gate

through the storm
knowing
the mountain is there

young boys slip through
clumps of men

woodsmoke 
an heirloom photo of someone
no one knows

a garbage can
in the middle of the street
deepening autumn

a new light
on the dashboard
evening rain

falling into
the longest night
fresh snow

leaning trees
almost touch across the creek
a dove’s flight display

sultry night
the rhythm of oars
stroking the lake

clipping tags
from luggage
summer’s end

rolling in
with the morning fog
seabird on a wave

mist into rain
the drone of a small plane
blends with our chanting

headwaters
the dipper’s shadow
follows its call

out of names 
we sit silent in the dark
among the stars

autumn dusk
the gates of the lock
close behind us

point reyes lighthouse
how the deep note travels
on the water

school bell
noticing her
for the first time

farmers’ market 
on the mangoes in the straw
a strand of tinsel

pinging sleet
she tugs tight
each stitch

the bootprints end 
the brook keeps flowing
into the deep woods

dark so soon
a stand of pines
with snow-broken limbs

warm from the dryer
summer clothes
for the suitcase

christmas concert 
mary keeps the beat
on the baby jesus

mouse sounds
a chunk missing
from the moon

town dump
a bear just sits there
in the falling snow

biting wind

over each other’s heads

if purple
were my color
twilight snow

before tonight’s frost
bringing in a cricket’s song
with the geraniums

a new day
how to translate
this talk of crows

field of wild iris 
the pinto pony
kicks up his heels

shimmering beneath the glaze
blue brush strokes
on the chinese ginger jar

the meadowlark
holding down the fencepost
with song

too early awake
but this mockingbird
this moon

glissandos
rippling from the strings
wind from the sea

deep in this world
of monet water lilies
no sound

the raven goes
where the wind went

pausing
halfway up the stair 
white chrysanthemums

late november

to the nursing home

locking the door
for the last time

in the morning sun

of her xmas cookies
the same snowflake

reducing the city
to ruins

with his wedding ring

do i need to know

crickets continue
our conversation

meditation over
the crickets
still chirping

under the influence
of a strawberry moon

tough as we sound
our eyes
on the fireflies

full of pear bruises

in the chimes

through the dark

sink into darkness

on the locked shed

across the frying pan

of an orange beetle

he polishes the barware
with a flourish

at my parents’ grave

around my ankles

in the icy lake

slicks the cafe tables

in the year-end crowd
her white cane

into a ring of ice

onto my face

before the stars appeared

of crickets

anywhere

among the red

of the space museum

around the moon

tickles my neck

on every step

i sweep away

in the kitchen

with plum blossom

in snow country

the orange pills
cut in half

i tell the calf
i’m a vegetarian

the stones from low tide
still on my desk

rain-wet sidewalk 
each maple key leaves
its own signature

year of the rooster
the wind chimes swivel
soundlessly

deep in the woods
the mourning doves
deeper

mosquitoes
the slap of a beaver tail
at twilight

everywhere this morning
maple keys soaking in
the gentle rain

just a little peek
the underside
of passion flower

friday afternoon
a farmer mows hay
in zigzag patterns

filament slides
off my father’s reel
the faint current

the humid night 
ancient wood carvings
shift their gaze

the dog takes a sniff 
snow that didn’t go
with the first warm day

a minute
more daylight than yesterday 
paperwhites

peering into
the deep well two boys
talk about girls

morning mist
the swallows return
to last year’s nest

misty river 
the drone of the drawbridge
still in my ears

spring longing 
following animal tracks
as far as i can

dragging her jacket
home from school
first spring peepers

from the mouths
of old stone frogs
the sound of water

rain clouds
a river frog’s head
pops back down

lilacs in bloom
a swallowtail crosses
the double yellow line

redwood grove
their arguing
hushed

storm clouds
water darkens
around the tea bag

peak hour traffic
beneath the harbour bridge
a humpback slaps its tail

her latest worry
a raven lands
on the one bare limb

new boy in town
throwing snowballs
at his own snowman

moonless night 
i read your letter
by heart

drifting leaves
the slow arc
of a wrecking ball

dappled sunlight 
waiting to hear
you’re safely home

icy mortuary steps 
linen or muslin
for her shroud?

third blizzard 
the untuned piano’s
middle c

scent of the river
in some of the laundry
indian summer

autumn drizzle 
a grove of maple trees
lights the way home

morning glories
what is left
of the rain

again and again
to the tip of the rod
red dragonfly

black clouds part 
a moon so full
i could howl

women’s refuge 
new light finds the blue
in painted glass

fall migration 
the park duck waddles
back to the pond

stillness
after the storm 
furled hibiscus

autumn hike
slowly we descend the mountain
into evening

graffiti
sharper
by moonlight

late supper
the smell of tomato plants
under my fingernails

fallen sycamore 
the chess players move
to another tree

now and then
when my neighbor is away
blackberries

adirondack chair
falling madrona blossoms
tick on the deck

summer sunset 
briefly the magpie
rimmed with gold

fourth of july 
not a breath of wind
to stir the flag

a little escape
from the world and its affairs 
the scent of jasmine

warm day
an inchworm stretches
beyond the leaf edge

i tap the crystal
four waiters attentive to
the green-leafed wind

loose hair
the wind brings me
an old song

all saints’ day 
beams of a lighthouse
sweep through the rain

morning dew
i trace my son’s
lifeline

autumn melancholy
she snaps a picture
of the flame-red zinnia

‘tis great to be alive!
how to say this
to the scarecrow?

harvest moon
the long pull
of faraway children

st francis’s feast
a fly crawls across
the communion wafers

concession speech
the dog waits patiently
on the porch

thanksgiving mass
a shaky hand offers me
the chalice

thanksgiving
the flower vendor
counts his roses

thanksgiving
the two of us
and a salmon

sudden hope
as i leave the house 
magnolia

easter egg hunt
the smell of onion grass
on my son’s breath

daffodil shoots 
all these years
as an accountant

aged hands
a caterpillar
on her life line

dusk in the city
the parking attendant sings
with pavarotti

torn ceiling blocks 
near the finches’ nests
flutter and chatter

new warmth 
the ruffled feathers
of the raven’s throat

spring planting 
a redbird offers a seed
to his mate

first warm evening
grandpa mimics
a swan

dandelion seed
drifting through the lawn party
her perfume

pausing
halfway through a life
with chrysanthemums

afternoon of a faun
snow sparkles
in the arroyo

the old wind chimes
in the basement for winter
tinkle from my sigh

tree-filtered moon
the night wind
in a leafpile

gone then?
cherry petals fall away
in the rain

her gentle passing
a robin flock settles
on the front porch

this is how life is 
hearing the cricket at dawn
just as it ceases

if someone should ask
tell them she loved
ginger snaps and tea

a ripple
reaches the pond’s edge 
daffodils

warm hand held tightly
dream of a maple seedling
ready for planting

her last breath
the strings vibrating
on her dusty harp

news of her death 
winter moon descending
beyond the trees

she is gone
the soft call
of a mourning dove

raining 
i discuss tomorrow
with falling petals

no night clouds 
just the numbing news
of her crossing over

quiet arroyo
the song borne somewhere else
by wind

moonless
the rain-muffled cries
of returning geese

i pause
halfway up the stair
because she has paused

november sunset 
now you can chat with
all the stars

hotel window
a thistledown blows in
and out

late autumn
and all the songbirds have gone
 the lilt in his voice

where snowflake
becomes lake  safe beyond
all accident

morning bells
through a crack in the shutter
one bright star

sunset today
more wintery more solemn
than usual

catching the twinkle
in frog eyes among the reeds 
old pond jumped in

fog
just the tree
at the bus stop

wind in the pines
never have i dreamed
of sleeping alone

out of hospital 
the summer grasses
up to my chin

rose garden
i’ve forgotten which one
is called peace

summer night
a baby changed
on the hood of a chevy

no moon 
on my knees i promise her
a glowworm

sleeping alone 
i begin to learn
the cricket’s song

their hands lightly touch
at the nursing home picnic
a raindrop or two

another wish 
puffballs ripe
for the wind

laughter
in a foreign tongue
summer stars

shooting star
conversation halts
around the campfire

the final push
of a laboring bison
slow-rising sun

dusting of snow
all the lights on
in the daycare

a leafless tree 
suddenly my father
comes to mind

snowlit night
the bedroom window
whistles a tune

sleepless night
snow to rain
by the sound of it

winter evening 
the newborn calf
eyes everybody

first snow
the smile
of a stranger

locust pods
in a raw wind 
thinking it over

crash of winter waves 
cries of the golden finch
shut in its cage

waiting for the heron
to turn my way 
winter rain

afternoon sun
the wake of a mallard
flickers on the birch

spring thaw 
under the hemlock
a handful of feathers

first warm day 
torn caution tape
at the trailhead

another spring
the nameless shoot
still nameless

spring rain 
speaking of the dead
in a softer voice

dinner alone
the neighbor’s cat comes ‘round
to do the dishes

amid plum blossoms
my son and i
speak of recovery

spring thaw
a new spider
in the mailbox

arlington
the tulips
wide open

spring chill
i search for the phone number
of a missing friend

acres of gold
fallen leaves hide
our childhood path

family reunion
a tablecloth
pops in the wind

drifting leaves
the postman
stops to talk

unemployed
withered leaves stop
beside me

soles tender
against the gravel 
starry night

persimmons
the last kid drops
from the monkey bars

the wind that once
lifted your hair
here again today

no letter today
fog takes away the bend
in the road

evening sun 
the light and dark side
of each tree

moonlit clouds
over the native graveyard 
our feet deep into moss

the feel of blossoms
on the back of my hand
spring dusk

daffodil hill
a peacock’s cry as we
dust our clothes

mother’s day sale 
pulling the red wagon
filled with plants

last day of term
emptying the backpack
of old lunches

rain-streaked windows
how to paint
the finch’s song

spring night 
her moonlit zipper curves
from throat to waist

morning half-moon
a mockingbird echoes
the rooster

after the teenagers leave
the dishwasher
and sparrow song

the lightest rain
a young squirrel springs out
from under its tail

in seat 12a
she holds a vase of lilacs
on her lap

new year’s eve 
she teaches me
how to breathe

cold morning rain
all the swoosh is gone
from the fallen leaves

bus stop 
the winter dance
of cold feet

what the raven
has to say about them
snow clouds

frosty morning
an old man boxes
his shadow

tooth marks
in the sharp cheddar
the long night

new year’s day
the sycamore’s
uneven shadow

winter dawn 
waiting for the school bus
kids pretend to smoke

first snow!
the congregation of birds
suddenly bolder

taps
a snowflake melts
on her dimple

a squabble of jays 
he shovels my bootprints
off the sidewalk

smell of matches
we recall the movies
that made us scared

frost moon
a dented nail head
catches the light

roadside shrine
a child blows out
all the prayers

morning prayers
a glass cathedral
echoes vowels

fireplace glow
first signs of fraying
in the cane-back rocking chair

dark of the moon
turning the penny heads up
for someone else

funeral march 
watching their grief
from behind

mountain churchyard
even the rocks
painted white

first warm day
the derelict’s
yellow tie

falling leaves
a clear view
of the wind-farm

deleting
my pregnancy app
autumn rain

snow in the forecast
she asks me when i started
turning gray

whence?
what?
navel lint

cancer center
walking uphill
against the wind

cabin fever
intermittent wriggling
in the cocoon

alone with a cat
three entire days
alone with a cat

snowdrops
the sunset song
of a winter wren

a collie's bark
last of the winter clouds
driven north

chickadee's call
our comfort together
without talking

snow likely
the auctioneer begins
with an old sleigh

bonsai winter
i shovel around the pine
with a teaspoon

her first home
she praises
the faucets

theatre nightholding each other
in the last row

anniversary
the gas log's
steady flame

six months alone
moorhen prints
frozen in mud

your fingerprints
on the window pane
the steam of one mug

more bad news
the comfort
of canned soup

buds on bare branches
breaking the back of the winter
that took you away

swimsuit dangling
on a leafy branch
distant thunder

first skinny-dip
the intimate kiss
of a leech

mourning dove solo
i caress my belly
and the scar

on my shadow
a butterfly
opens its wings

honeysuckle hour
the humid air crawls
into dreams

which way is she going?
a gecko licks
its eyes

midsummer
conversation drifts
over the fence

drying upstream
the fading voice
of river rocks

summer heat
mud daubers motionless
under the bridge

summer moon
we exchange
childhoods

hitchhiking
the doppler effect
of a car horn

summer breeze
the sound of someone
beating a futon

tree-fern gully
the sound of water
in a greener light

kookaburra
our differences
dissipate

sunlit afternoon
finding the whistle
in a blade of grass

temple bell
petal by petal
the pond blooms

which one
of heaven's doors
woodpecker

as if he were
carving the sky
glide of a hawk

the shape
of the trout stream
wild phlox

closing time
still a crowd of pigeons
at the chip shop door

light
on the salt marsh
first egret

wind in the sail
the sea
with no zip code

with paint and brush
i go up   down the ladder
house sparrow's nest

my house now
purple clover colonizes
the backyard

graduation
dandelion seeds
floating on the breeze

the things she learns
the things i learn
puppy sitting

back to back
on the treehouse floor
blood brothers

dugout bench
neatsfoot oil perfumes
a new glove

summer afternoon
the right fielder
just standing there

garden snail
the distance
between galaxies

her hand-woven shawl
lightly draped
river mist

evening musicale
the pianist opens
for the moon

darkened village
the bat's calls bouncing off
the milky way

through all the streets
through all the smells
same moon

lost dog
i leave my voice
in every street

first coyote's
dark ululation
then there are ten

family nostalgia
she bites a loose thread
in the narrative

be a woman first
grandmother whispers
her last words

ancient bowl
the fire's breath held
in the wood ash glaze

smallpox
a stone arrowhead
darkened by the rain

summer's end
the last peach jar's
vacuum click

once a farmer
always a farmer
harvest moon

dragonfly
resting on my paddle
we will drift a while

he'd've done
the same for me
autumn equinox

calm sea
motionless masts
in the moonlight

garlic harvested
the hammock encloses
my curve

moss covered rock
i touch the warmth left
by a cormorant

autumn mist
we taste our way through
the orchard

twilight colors
through the trees
the impossibility of peach

broken fence
sunlight enters
on a fawn

rainbow
the robin sings in
green

the foal and i
on nodding terms
early daffodils

morning wind
the branch on which
the swallow had sung

childhood church
dipping my finger
in the empty font

evolution
my son draws a dinosaur
for a girl

soft-boiled egg
my daughter asks
how stones are born

old temple
a trained raven
with its hiya

breakfast
without her
i pack the leftovers

tuning in
to the forest rain
sunday morning

berry stains
washing my face
with the mississippi

carnival
the pink noise
of candy floss

crow caw
i tell my sins
to the forest gods

cemetery hill
out of network
i read epitaphs

sundown
the fisherman
dumps his cooler

into the van
a final box of odds and ends
wisteria scent

darkness
a moth carries
its own light

some color
in the bird's undertail
a late spring

leaving
not an option
wild daffodils

dogwood shore
my cousin the marine
who went first

the pond's surface
trembling at the touch
of a kingfisher's feather

sure enough
that's my signature
red quince blossoms

thinking of you
$500 for a rolling
stop

exterminating
an ant colony
under the welcome stone

this spring
i listen longer
mourning doves

infield
single
dandelion

warm afternoon
a bouncy castle rises
over the back fence

fireflies
i hear myself repeat
myself

lingering summer
the weather vane lion
stands still

day at the beach
a dixie cup of wet sand
for the castle

as if sunlight
had all the answers
a bouquet of daisies

evening play
a coiled millipede slides
from kid to kid

deeper down
a road with no signs
tasseling corn

smoky twilight
among the ruins
toy soldiers

plant-sitting
whether to water
the cactus

under the cuban sun
the tropical colors
of buicks and chevys

quiet night
a water strider rests
on a star

more substantial
than the flexing cobweb
its shadow

alpine holiday
recalled in one shake
of a snow globe

moonlit shallows
a stranded octopus
enters the afterlife

mackerel sky
the curlew becomes one
with the mudflat

shorter days
the ping
in plum jam lids

autumn colors
begin to arrive
classroom coat hooks

autumn wind
what to do
with my druthers

in the wake
of the newlyweds' car
autumn leaves

nine-month belly
she slowly unwraps
the heirloom crèche

bullfrogs
the widow looks out
her parlor window

maddening heat
the cicada still singing
in the crow's beak

bird house empty of seed
even the jays
look for bernard

old tombstone
losing its name
faint first star

heat lightning
the shuttle snaps
across the warp

starlit sky 
i touch a turtle
before it enters the sea

listening to
the ocean’s history 
spring sunset

wet feet
from the same rain 
the elevator stops at our floor

spring breeze 
i catch the tune
she leaves behind

the hiss of air
from a rubber raft
summer twilight

she hides
i seek
fireflies

their ancient hum
to sunrise
honeybees

spring fest
new piglets nestle
into pink

education
in the oral tradition
birdsong

small pond
a breeze rearranging
cherry petals

no one
we knew
roadside flowers

spring night
a woman is dancing
with wet hair

turning a short walk
into a long one
magnolias

spring lightning
a flower's shadow
against the fortress wall

solar power
how to franchise
what lilacs do

morning showers
the last piece of watermelon
floats in the cooler

jaywalking
just to stay in the shade
summer's passing

summer loneliness
ripples from the canoe
envelop the beaver lodge

summer breeze
wheat ears bend
into birdsong

heat lightning
something ancient
in a lizard's eye

mountain pass
catching the birth
of a cloud

summer's end
all the days at the beach
stuffed into this tote

day moon
what sunshine
does to my dreams

sunset
the rust on grandpa's
license plates

returning home
our headlights pan across
the uncut grass

weeding
what my hands know
by heart

before it begins
the sound of rain
deep in the woods

pink blossoms
in hanging baskets
city life

time alone
time together
sand pipers

family reunion
extra salt
and vinegar

imagining her voice
a dawn wind
wrinkles the sea

lotus flower
the long climb
to sunlight

signing my will
with a new pen
the summer wind

forest stream
dipping my head into
the world of pebbles

oblique shadows
afternoon rests
on a wattlebird's tunes

italiano
i point the way
with a cappuccino

heat wave
the smell of creosote
crosses the tracks

lingering heat
a bike with no wheels
chained to a tree

fifth floor walk-up
an elevated train screeches
through the heat

clouds
a few drops
of probability

afternoon rain
grandpa's tobacco
dwindles

water lilies
the pond
grows smaller

nine kinds
of lonesome
night train

night before christmas
the stray dog comes
when i call

flight delay
the familiar faces
of strangers

fast lane
the flickering smile
of a stranger

winter milking
my cheek fits the warm curve
of cow

pond ice
reconcilable
differences

dark clouds loom
in the valley
a stain of light

white breath rises
the mouth of a minnow
frozen open

the mouse's neck
askew in the trap
seasonal depression

snow
the mustang in it
up to his heart

dawn to daylight
the time it takes
to stand up straight

nursing home
a sip of water for
the potted violet

winter sky
a gull lets the tide
lap its feet

blustery day
parking tickets flap
on the windshields

the teabag
slouched in its mug
work day's end

cold night
the snow crust
holds the cat

starry night
the geometry
of mythology

wild grass
i draw the first eye
on a daruma doll

late march
snow falls through
the hoop

wild
the sun
on horseback

greening willow
she shakes her hair
loose from the cap

spring
a fresh set of strings
for her ukulele

laundry line
the long swoop
of a song sparrow

windblown apple blossoms
i reach
for my childhood

planting flowers
my father packs soil
with his cane

her cupped hands
the rest stop of
journeying petals

blossom viewing
she has found
my bald spot

rain squall
this rigmarole
of umbrellas

a parakeet's cry
shades of green
in the eucalypt

summer solstice
a sparrow's
perfect pitch

thin slices
of habanero
a bull elk bugling

a slew
of new noises
bear scat

still day
a spiraling blur
of cabbage whites

the brumby mare
flicks her forelock
valley storm

midtown fountain
the dancer pirouettes
with a pigeon

the cloud's shape
no longer what it was
dandelion puff

sailing among
cabbage whites and coppers
thistle seeds in the wind

walking at dusk
seeing no-see-ums
dance in a sunbeam

first kiss
light from the porch light
in his hair

tea leaves
the moonlight
in my future

harvest moon
cane toads crowding
the dog's bowl

coastal village
coconut trees shaking off
excess wind

half a field to go
hay bale shadows stretch
to swallow us

bandw photo
my mother with red camellias
when she was happy

a crow works
the demolition rubble
autumn deepens

from the dark
side of the mountain
raven's cry

a hideous hedge
grows against the will
of the wind

prairie storm
the darkness disperses
as buffalo

at the edge
of a crescent moon
sandhill cranes

kitchen remodel
the feminine shape
of the faucet

autumn solitude
the temptation
to reply all

geese gathering
the gusty rattle
of corn stalks

late autumn
the stillness of blue
miles deep

morning snow
the sound of goats
tugging hay from the hayrick

frost heaves
once again
we ignore the obvious

midnight snowfall
an arc of green shoots
in the onion basket

august heat
a walnut leaf imprinted
in fresh asphalt

log in
log out
summer cabin

nightfall
approaching
mosquito

peeling a courgette
the sound of child's play
in another language

sputtering campfire
the singer to my left
just makes up words

drying lavender
no longer fluent
in my mother tongue

drought
my ears have lost
the creek

he finds his steps
in the rhythm of seeds
sacred rattle

end of the camping trip
my truck hits the bump
from dirt road to paved

church bell
the glow of adobe
at sundown

until the last string
stops vibrating
holding our applause

the neighbors' dog
only they
can't hear it barking

sharp winter shadows
my fondness
for the scraggly apple tree

march ice crystals
a horse in a blanket
faces the sun

morning coffee
imagining my garden
beneath the snow

winter wake
all of him in such
a little box

good friday
my granddaughter gathers
broken pine cones

easter
a molehill next
to grandpa's grave

rushing weir
the slow rotation
of stranded debris

daffodil blooms
the curve of a duck's bill
shiny with rain

the frayed rope
swings back into the shade 
country swimming hole

trapped
in the revolving door
autumn leaves

pine-needled path
slowly i step
out of my mind

evening breeze
the spider cuts a petal
from its web

between
the chimes of the clock
shooting star

summer's end
a broken chair sits
at the water's edge

hot afternoon
the squeak of my hands
on my daughter’s coffin

eyes closed
while listening to her poem
the summer wind

first frost 
the thrush brings a snail
to the anvil stone

winter rain
the shape of shoulder blades
through her shawl

deathbed
my old friend’s imitation
of a firefly

ice moon 
the cat grooms away
my touch

lily stamens
almost touching
cicada cry

country graveyard
a hummingbird
she would’ve loved

cycling with my son 
this is the autumn
i fall behind

sparrows sift through
the shopping carts
autumn dusk

a deceased friend
taps me on the shoulder 
plum blossoms falling

a drop of pond
at the end of a beak
setting sun

gunshot
every pine needle
pointing at something

third day of snow
neighborhood kids build
a rhinoceros

winter morning
two butterflies
warm the garden

narcissus
my heartbeat races
towards its end

a setback
in her treatment
frost-tipped lavender

new minister
gutters guide a spring rain
back to the earth

march snowmen 
picassos appearing
on front lawns

miles of silence
a chill on my thigh
when he changes gears

snowmelt
the caw of the crow returns
to the hickory

snowdrops surround
an empty snail shell
pale day moon

tsunami
untangling
my knotted rosary

temple bells
the clink of coins
in ceramic pots

i check once again
for any missed calls 
intermittent rain

crewelwork
the musty scent
of geraniums

high sun
ants to the top
of the okra stalk

august rain
the one bitter almond
in a whole bag

nailing roof iron
with my father’s hammer
the echoes

attic light
dust rising from the dark
in the magic hat

ebb tide
mangrove roots hold
a downy feather

dentist’s window
birds picking out
the sunflower seeds

low tide
dusk collecting
in the shells

early morning silence
soon enough
everything

summer solstice
one flip-flop
circling the pool

shade for the longest day of the year
  
clouds we’ll never feel again

landfall
for a jellyfish
and lightning

for a moment
your shadow
is my shadow

drawn blinds
just in time a skink slips
from my sandal

cumulonimbus
a man rolls a cardboard box
too large to carry

a girl’s laughter 
waterfalls flinging
rainbows

shooting star
my wish for
an unhurried life

the woman
i say i don’t love
key lime pie

dry brook
a choice
of stepping stones

first men on the moon
the first time i tasted
rattlesnake

heat spike
a blister beetle probes
the cactus flower

i remember
your braid 
girl gone to soldier

a mill wheel
slowly turning 
more and more stars

thunderstorm 
the autistic boy
beats his drum

skinny dipping
the black eyes
of the fish crow

the child
a bit ahead of us
summer stars

hiroshima day
a giant peony blooms
in my dream

moonless night
i close my eyes
and disappear

late fall 
squirrelways
in the canopy

gifts from my mother
unwrapping them
with their shadows

sipping tea
pine needles brush
my window

left soaking
in dishwater
the long night moon

bright winter night
my head
made of glass

dry leaves 
between each step
a silence

no season word
yet autumn pervades
her suicide note

solstice light
i take
what is offered

log fire
the steady click
of knitting needles

new year’s eve 
the harpist’s fingers
glide toward midnight

aspens
in a circle
twilight

wild mustard 
to all the wishes wished here
add this one of mine

revolution 
i slice the lemon
into itself

harvest moon
the circus disassembles
pole by pole

first day of school
my son brings home
his peach stone

summer stars
my children ask me
to name a favorite

a white feather
without a bird
flies by

urban sprawl
a huddle of hard hats
and a dead tree

too far away
to see the flag
full moon

fragrance of cedar
he tucks the twig
behind her ear

post-op
the holy medal’s features
imprinted in my palm

hunter’s moon
the gator’s eyes
hold the light

more space
for the raven’s voice
winter sky

cloud dragon
eating its own tail 
epiphany day

muted sunlight
the crisp corners
of the folded flag

last light
prying a pigeon
from the dog’s mouth

frost-sparkled paddock
he digs the grave
a little deeper

winter solstice
reading glasses
to see myself

winter pear
my breath condenses
on the knife

crocus buds 
secrets we’ve kept
from each other

approaching rain
the smell of sauerkraut
lingers on the stairs

cyclone warning
the cracked red paint
glistens with rain

spring day
the cord zings back
into the vacuum

downwind
the breath
of lemon blossoms

butterfly
lingering on the breeze
her first kiss

afternoon tea 
each ant takes away
a granule of light

along the roadside
dixie cups
of summer wind

fording the river
the moment closest
to neither bank

north star
so many places
to call home

distant galaxies
taking another
wrong turn

heat lightning
the fly moves below
my ankle bone

day moon
the hollow sound
of the water tank

summer night
the coin laundry’s
fish-less tank

goat-bell
a star
goes out

midnight dusk
the blur of moths
around a buddleia

village road
the jingle of bullock carts
in the mist

spring day
announcement said
no flowers

progress
the cobweb repaired where
it crosses the gate latch

dogwoods
the stench of
baby questions

dancing
above the hedgerow
just her hat

water
upon water
a spider into the bud

easter morning
three silos
on the horizon

an eye
in the window
of a birdhouse

the pause
he takes on his flute 
spring rain

age 88
all the whatchamacallits
in the spring wind

the snow melted
fences reappear
between neighbors

nuthatch
headlong down the oak
vernal equinox

spring morning
doing something new
with pink scarves

straggles of mist
ancestors evaporating
in a highland dawn

all that stirs
in the river’s womb
spring rain

log split
a moth
flies out

spring shadows 
new razor
for the teenaged son

first swallow of the season
modigliani’s woman
longing for it

resurrection sky
mother somewhere between
here and there

one year on
a black-faced sheep
grazes the regrowth

autumn trees
getting her to
do the talking

end of harvest
pulling out the leaves
of the table

secondhand bookshop
red wine stains
in the rubaiyat

autumn sun 
map in hand i search
for my grave site

urban planning
a row of poplars
at ear-level

full moon
the scent of cocoa butter
on her baby bump

remnants of daylight
the wind rattles
with old mustard

mourning
the mask
the mime

the knife sharpener
on his bicycle 
falling leaves

fish scales
on the serrated knife
catching sunset

autumn begins
the crack of an acorn
beneath my shoe

the morning moon
accompanying me
to my new job

riffles
a belted kingfisher
splinters the light

maroon recliner
unwanted in the corner
motionless sea

prairie sky
the trucker secures
a wide load

a fossil fish
in a box of beach sand
first day of school

almost dusk
the trawler men
drink tea

dad’s yahrzeit 
a white moth
clings to my window

ship’s rail 
moonlight all the way
to the moon

indian summer 
the distance
between roses

winter shadows
adding water to the last
of the soup

snow beginning to drift
my mother shares memories
she never had

midwinter night
between the swells
beyond the surf

meandering
along the ice cracks
a midnight moon

camphor flame
a mother directs her child
to pray

winter roses
father shows us photographs
he no longer sees

deep winter
how often we opened
windows to persimmons

here other
than wind’s lamentation
nothing is

winter stillness 
turkey tracks frozen
in the ice

reconstructing
a field mouse 
owl pellets

late wisteria
the stepladder
wobbles

twilight
the poultry truck returns
with empty cages

the bee dies
separate from its stinger 
and i ?

orange sunrise
through gaps in the sagebrush
meadowlark song

longest day
binge watching
billowing sky

skipping stones
and sometimes
i remember

tea party
the child fills each cup
with rain water

summer alone
i rearrange the checkers
on the board

afternoon rain
my body curls around
your absence

enough mint scent
to cross the milky way
high summer begins

june roses
the neighborhood skunk
making night-time rounds

a great boom
as the sandbar breaks
trembling stars

mountain fog
the eye of sauron
on my stove

skimming over
the ancient writings
first snowflakes

chess night
cats under the table
capture toes

christmas eve
the sleeping child's
weight

full orchestra
the acoustics
of my chest

new year's eve
a solar panel
in the dark

my finger
touches yours
finding orion

new year's day
the kitchen is full
of empties

winter blues
more snap
to the cold

my handprint fades
from the frosted window
72 winters

through a window screen
sage advice
for the nursing home gardener

mistakes
may have been made
kudzu

full-service
the station attendant spits
tobacco juice

another tweet-storm
finches at the feeder

summer squall
a half-hearted dash
to the car

sheltering
in place
redwoods

red amaryllis
i reach
for courage

the clarity
of binary choice
roadside daisies

begonia
its slight sway
steadies my mind

rustle of corn leaves
fitting my son
for a new ball glove

cows' tails
hanging idly
autumn chill

ganesh smiles
steaming rice pudding
in copper cauldrons

his hand
as i step from the stile
a rain of leaves

assisted living birthday
mother tells my age
to everyone

autumn rain
i settle into
a 12-bar blues

all hallow's eve
my brother comes home
in a dream

day of the dead
a shrunken pumpkin
for my sister

one brown leaf
falls to the pavement
dad smoked camels

blown kisses
the goodbye as long
as the platform

until mountains
come between us
migrating cranes

fields of lupin
the wind shifts the line
between sky and earth

summer breeze
a coneflower meanders
the butterflies

leaning fence
the weight
of moonflowers

summer evening
taking my time
in the maze

grounded rowboat
bruised clouds settle
over the lake

summer ending
a mosquito's slow flight pattern
over the dinner table

city balcony
memories of the forest
crowded in pots

last summer day
i estimate
my mortality

sunlight fades
the two yellow butterflies
still circle each other

island vacation
the knowledge
it would be our last

dark clouds
a hawk soars
through the valley's rumble

cascading brook
with thinned ink he paints
the water

spring runoff
just enough pond
to catch a frog

the freight train
finally passes
spring peepers

behind the pigeon
a folded falcon
unfolding

mill town home coming
snake eggs still hatch
in the sawdust pile

blossom rain
part of the bank deposit
available today

wildflower afternoon
i pause to inhale
the light

loon tremolo
moonlight rides
her chick's back

wild blackberries
the scent of autumn
after it rains

just enough breeze
to turn a leaf
autumn equinox

whalesong
in the wake of silence
a pale moon

college move-in day
early acorns pelting
the mini-van

september vespid
i eat dinner alone
on the porch

dusk in the valley
just enough light
to see the falcon soar

a clearwing
slips past rake tines
fall equinox

hum of mosquitoes
one last cast
at the moon

drought
our chicken rearranges
her dirt

blazing sun
the carcass of a lizard
in an empty pond

dry creek bed
the dingo's howl
wavers

outback sunset
wild camels float
in the heat shimmer

blistering heat
black bear tracks
in the asphalt

lingering heat
a hawk-moth sways
on the underleaf

harmattan fire
the charred debris
of red anthills

eight-fold path
lost in the back alleys
of kathmandu

hummingbird feeder
the downy woodpecker
figures it out

morning sun
a constellation of holes
in the rhubarb leaf

board meeting
the cricket
has the floor

only the wake
at the river's bend
autumn light

rising floodwater
the flag and pole laid
on a pew

splitting pills
for the arthritic dog
autumn equinox

thick fog
the merchant drops his bell
and calls out his wares

selling the house
a leaf imprint
in the sidewalk

a whisper
between friends
turning aspen

yom kippur
a candle
for santoka too

indian summer
was i ever the man
i used to be

first star
crutches leaning
on the stairs

mother's hands
curled on the quilt
winter light

through his late wife's glasses
nothing but the world

winter bones
the rooster begins
another day

icy morning
the metallic rattle of
the toilet roll spindle

christmas in nigeria
my chicken's silent prayer
to the god of chickens

microbial life
the most of me
i've never met

on the front lawn
of the difficult neighbor
a snow angel

ringing in the year
the last guest leaves us
with the stars

old graveyard
sun bleached
fake flowers

raining so hard
nothing else is possible

morning fog
the hearsay
of birds

jasmine tea
bird by bird
the dawn becomes day

my father sees
another springa bullfinch
in the birch tree

the narrow steps
lead me to the open sky
pilgrimage

flowering
it finds a way
through the stone wall

the scar
slowly healing
wildflowers

a magic gate
tucked in the lilac hedge
the crow told me so

spring fever
the farm gate swung wide
for the bull

the final splash
of a skipping stone
fourth of july

bayside waves
the pulse
along her neck

surf's edge
foam pearls
into itself

ripening mangoes
the sunset
between batwings

wind scent
parting the curtains
to let in the forest

meditation retreat
all the different sounds
of the lyrebird

over our feet
the future curves
with the river

summer lightning
the vanilla scent
of ponderosa pine

hot night
the drawbridge rumbles
under passing cars

tai chi
with my wife
morning glories open

winter stillness
each blackberry thorn
clearly seen

a few leaves
left on the tree
we have our talk

unemployed
the uneven edge
of a quahog shell

first violet 
my grandmother
every time

wildflowers
each of them
a different me

palm sunday
the sound of a frond
ripping

bearing down
on a borrowed pen
do not resuscitate

a slight shake of bells
as the harness comes off
night snow

insomnia
length of the night
on her knitting needles

one plate one fork one spoon
winter evening

insomnia
length of the night
on her knitting needles

a grave in hoar frost
i saw it when i was
helped to sit up

god of death may have
a wife and children
i bathe in the winter sun

granite cliffs
a row of headstones
awaiting names

broken shower
the wrench to fix it
has moved out

as long
as it takes
the ferns unfurling

soft velvet
a roe buck bends his antlers
to the burn

spring walk
the train trestle
and its many shadows

spruce forest
i follow the fox's path
through wood sorrel

spring wind
the hound in the pickup
all ears

lifting mist
a barnyard in sunlight
with a chicken in it

may rain
i pour tea into
my considerations

taking the measure
of window glass
spring wasp

fern scent
the slight space between
doe and fawn tracks

mother's day
the baby sitter asleep
by the crib

cloudless day
a jay brings the sky
into the lilacs

waving cattails
a turtle drifts
with the clouds

high tea
sparrows on the rim
of the birdbath

camping alone
without butter or salt
the taste of bread

beneath
the snail's shell
a heartbeat

summer's end
the lifeguard watches
an empty pool

boyhood friend
the shadow of my bike
on his grave

hill after hill of olive trees
the warmth of the day
on my handlebars

stiff breeze
each darning needle
clings to its grass

cave walls
the lost tongues
of ochre figures

late day-light
the belly of a gull
as it glides

dusk
a blackbird's song
fills the clearing

box of ashes
the road edged
with road-colored birds

autumn equinox
a milkweed seed catches
on a milkweed pod

autumn leaves
old broom losing itself
bristle by bristle

seals in the swells
the old wooden roller coaster's
long slow climb

picnic hill
clouds float through
a bottle of wine

thunder
out of the blue
a feather

reconnecting the dots
in a different direction
ripe cantaloupe

blue moon
herring gulls tending
a second clutch

reminding myself
he's only looking for love
tarantula

edge of the woods
some things i may not
want to know

almost dusk
a wave releases a kelp sash
short of the tiderow

summer's end
i unpack
the smell of the sea

school's out
trout idling
under a footbridge

fireflies
someone leaving
someone coming home

crossroads
a birdcall
decides me

a blue rock
big enough to end
water song

father's day
a few weather patterns
between us

saving a space
for you
summer stars

bodhi tree
not a single leaf
is still

off and on
the stone lantern
firefly

reaching out
to touch the void
snake's tongue

summer clouds
wondering what i'll be
in the next life

family dinner
as if we'll be alive
forever

snow print
the angel will be back
next year

cloud scrim
the candle for my father
burns all night

our voices
become whispers
deepening snow

lullaby moon
baby formula warms
my wrist

winter rain
tea bag strings
all tangled up

with a mind
of its own
the cat's tail

crows land
on a slow train
solar eclipse

corner deli
a dusting of snow
on imported tulips

foreclosure sale
the light left on
in an empty closet

the mare nips
at the farrier's ponytail
autumn chill

the very last thing
he couldn't hear
autumn wind

chilly breeze
my index finger
warm in my baby's hand

early frost
the silence
of aspens

autumn
a street sweeping truck
swallows the evidence

where my mind
first turns to murder
mouse droppings

subway tunnel
the recycled air
of a busker's song

snow all day
the deep green of collards
in sesame oil

endless night
the scrape of a blizzard
across the plains

muezzin call
the glint of morning
on a desert rose

red pickup
nothing left but
a dust cloud

mid-day heat
the young hooker
adjusts her skirt

jostled by the tide
luminescent tentacles
of a cuttlefish

heat wave
railroad tracks
dance to the vanishing point

talk of love
the trail explodes
with ladybugs

cobwebs in the loft
the rope we used to swing on
when we flew like birds

summer afternoon
the cloud saga
just begun

ice cream
thickening as it churns
family reunion

picnic
lightning
how many seconds

spring blossoms
sound of the creek
takes shape again

plumerias
a conch shell pierces
the morning mist

as if his hand
remained in my hand
sun-warmed stone

spring wind
my granddaughter's magic wand
makes me young

the end
of the beginning
pink petals swirl away

when i was a tree
the light of new leaves
through my eyelids

spritz of perfume
orangutan refugee

sweetgrass
the meadowlark weaves
a home

easter
the red tail hawk
eats alone

ballad of the moon
virgins painted
in primary colors

high tide
the warning buoy
tight on its chain

chased by a dog
here comes the paperboy
and news of the world

bright sun
a shadow travels the center stripe
as the crow flies

westward at sunset
urging the earth
to turn a bit more

faint scent
of burning leaves
briefly a child again

not everyone
made it to the reunion
wind-blown leaves

unsold pumpkins
straw from the store display
trails out the door

autumn leaves
i smile at a passerby
as if i know her

shaping
the empty sky
starlings

winter cold
a swan shakes off
the night

at the fridge
a head-butt
from the cat

the click click
of bone collecting
winter dusk

the freezing rain
showing all her teeth

without enemies
toy soldiers
defend the sofa

the soft click
of marbles an eye
for an eye

sun streams
through the space between us
spring thaw

spring cleaning
my neighbor hitting
a high note

gene splicing
i rearrange flowers
of the garland

moonlight
through cherry blossoms
sake shimmers at the brim

last chemo
a lotus above
the waterline

swaying bridges
my travel agent's idea
of remote places

summer glare
my brother's kite
tangles with mine

it's not what he says
it's how he says it
mating elephant seals

sunset sounds
the path into the woods
lit with white yarrow

in the blink
of a firefly
evening

string theory
a caterpillar
talking to the moon

midsummer's eve
turning the record
to its flip side

too much wine
the gnat drying out
on my fingertip

in eelgrass
the current reveals itself
summer stillness

forest stream   
looking for skipping stones
once more in my life

blue hour moment
between darkness and light
meadowlarks

fireflies
a prayer circle
joins hands

summer night
his sister and i
suddenly alone

again
i am the last to know
rip tide

a very good year
the fruit fly in my wine
is beyond saving

rain
the yellow smell
of quinces

humid breeze
the scent of basil
on her fingertips

streetlamps   
the slow migration
of a snail

one foot
on the mountain
then the other

darkening sky
the river gives no reason
for its song

labyrinth walk
the reliable cooing of
mourning doves

never younger
than now
i zest a lemon

medicine ball   
we stand closer
this year

knee-high grass
a bison's slow rise
from the wallow

as much forever
as we've got
the heart of summer

clarity of rocks
in the river shallows
sun on my back

tang of salt
the peaks of mountains
with chinese names

in one then another
of the kousa dogwoods
the flash of fireflies

the taste
of the last word
summer theatre

bonfire
the distance between me
and a ghost story

perseids
a wish for all those
who can do little else

clearing sky
a salmon falls back
into the roar

harvest moon
together we sway
through the barley

wind chimes
the spruce in two tones
of autumn light

you are here
on the trailside map
a resting monarch

i lift my foot
the world turns
autumn leaves

last of the harvest
the scarecrow's stake
among the stubble

cool bench
the call of geese
behind me

autumn evening
voices of children
trailing away

winter solstice
i suck the bones
of a carp

longest night
balancing his words
in a brush stroke

sunlight
slides into his empty sandals 
another winter

christmas night
this sudden desire to
look at the sky

year's end
the spot i revisited
within me

icicles   
keeping time
until the end

square anti-abortion signs
dry leaves curl
in the shadows

my father's life
under communism
cleaning the oil lamp

homeless shelter
mashed potatoes served
with an ice cream scoop

is it mental illness
the winter rose
perfectly still

autumn heat
the calf roper knocks
dust from his lasso

coming out
of the sea
what i once was

one part loneliness
one part boredom
waning crescent

for better or for worse
our lights and darks
tumbling together

shavings curl
from the sharpener
apple smell

space station
dropping behind
the horse chestnut trees

split wheat sack
a steady trickle
of sparrows

deep autumn
a copperhead crooked
on the sidewalk's edge

i add chemo
to the calendar   
new moon

a sliver of moon
the old bluesman
breaks a string

foghorns   
scoring the hours
of my insomnia

trying to listen
as if i didn't know him
wind through the trees

mallards fly away
darker shades of autumn
return to the river

all souls day
rosewood or pine
dad's still dead

a mandala
of pine needles
yesterday's rain

november cold
the vending machine
returns my coins

across the face
of a chalk horse
rook faces rook

snowy owl
the moon slicing pathways
through the woods

accumulating snow
time together
she won't remember

shape of her sleep
on the down pillow
snowy morning

bark
becoming whimper
becoming night

frost warning
a sleeping mallard
opens one eye

biting wind
a gap in
the picket line

all saints   
hands
in my pockets

my poems   
the woodcarver's
pile of chips

knot pine floors
furballs pirouette
behind the corn broom

cashmere scarf
the smell of mothballs
in our kiss

grebe colony
the warning beeps
of port trucks

tree ornaments
the angel from my childhood
missing a wing

lonely winter
a telephone wire
connects the stars

speckled egg
the sunlight
on my thoughts

sugar moon rising
our first grandchild expecting
a child of her own

ink stains
on the calligrapher's socks
cherry blossoms

rain running
off our waterproofs
the cormorant pair

one-lane bridge
we give way
to the scent of thyme

unknown birdsong
i wander deeper
into the forest

bromeliads
an extinct woodpecker
appears on film

scaling fish
dad calls mom
his mermaid

tiki bar
a part of me feels
right at home

winter evening
an unbought brioche
under glass

snowy path
squirrel footprints
to the hot tub

morning walk
sundogs
frozen in the sky

cold sunday afternoon
all the varieties
of windswept hair

my world spun
on roller-skates
first kiss

color coding
my to-do list
spring morning

sun-soaked chrysalis
the effort
no one sees

butterfly
my bra
too small

the sisters braid
each other's stories
strawberry fields

his first smile
catkins curve across
a brook

biological clock
a line in the sand
drawn by the tide

the paper rustle
of eucalyptus
still no rain

the slum boys stare at
the distant stars

her golden retriever
licks
the rapist

sock puppets
my son replays
last night's argument

day break   
mood of the forest
in the long call of a thrush

streaked morning sunlight
copper butterflies skimming
plantain and clover

imagining my last breath
the narrow trail to
a familiar mountain

forest by the lake
fish hide
behind the trees

mark loves mary forever 
erased by high tide
forever

above the clouds
travelling backwards
through time

rush hour
i enter
in third person

a young boy stays near
his father's legs

open drawbridge
a brown pelican
goes through first

butterfly
i remember
nothing

the remains of a fish
in a stone

the path that rain makes
through a cloud

sunlight
into the open grave
a handful of earth

funeral drinks
my cousin and i
exchange promises

after taps
that heavy silence   
then the keening

canyon wall
a spring sunset draws up
the evening shade

blossom wind
a black swan flaps
its clipped wings

frog at dawn
a grating of ginger root
for the oatmeal

memorial day
cut flowers
in their prime

burial mound
the earth
gives a little

great blue heron
out of the morning mist
into itself

croquet
a butterfly flits
through a wicket

prairie darkness
our motorcycle following
the north star

bitter cold
the distant train pulls
some of my night with it

city heat 
the grocer spritzes his greens
and little girls

i am the age
my father never was
spring planting

birdsong
my imaginary lover
alive again

cloudless sky
the baaing
of penned sheep

hermit thrush
knowing when it’s time
for me to go

17-year cicadas 
the persistent itching
of my stitches

ragged clouds
how it feels
to hold a rake

chicken wire
the softness
of the rabbit's nose

labor day
the crease finally worked
into new shoes

new coolness
the old dog stays
closer to home

half moon
your half interest
in the tryst

seventh-inning stretch
a foam finger pointing
at the autumn moon

falling leaves
my friend and i
discuss clutter

gray morning
the concrete business
of pigeons

rocking chairs
chained to the porch
leaves in the wind

moon viewing 
one of the garden lanterns
lights up

autumn wind
the leaves too
made of oak

all hallow's eve
moss-draped hemlocks
fade into night

the spiral
in a red hothouse rose 
year's end

auction day
dead leaves swirl
around the stone seat

wordless
in my borrowed tongue
plum blossoms

unseasonal heat
a woodpecker
and its ideas

a blossom
in the bird bath
sunny side up

mind chatter 
interrupted
by wildflowers

narrow sidewalk
i'm under her umbrella
for a moment

first sumi-e
my apologies
to the bamboo

each needle
on the saguaro
first light

stray thoughts
a butterfly probes
the netting

a handstand
just to see if i can 
honeysuckle

unmarked graves
the wind holds
a hint of sea

half sun
a ewe rests her chin
on her dozing lamb

wild seeds
the garden
arranges itself

blossoms
some of her words
i know by heart

lake mist
the shaman speaks
of water spirits

brittle cold
the day moon
half gone

farm for sale
the grandchild picks
a bouquet of weeds

april playground
only the teacher
wears a coat

swollen river
a jacaranda bud
in the child's palm

third-day moon
my side of the pizza
with anchovies

pink sunrise
the black seeds
of a watermelon

evening cool
two barefoot boys
fish the stream

heat wave 
children's voices
after dark

thunderclap
the warmth
of her breast

gone to seed
a wish not mine
breezes by

salad days
the heat of hormones
and beach sand

young boys
wrestling in the yard
wild rhubarb

boys' dorm
the glow of a firefly
in a bottle

robbing the bees
she speaks of
lip balm

city park
sun getting low
in the bottle

a voiceless cicada
quivers on the reed by
the heron's nest

flowering briefly
you
and the spider lily

the poet
sings a new song
sound of rain

birdsong
a clothesline
dripping light

shore for the poet
shore for the poet's work
water lily fragrance

round and beautiful
the moon breathing with cut grain
slowly moves westward

autumn
the great blue
gone from the marsh

familiar hymns
prayers worn deep
in the wood

first frost
radish seeds rinsed
for the sprout jar

what she said
driving home
the sound of blinkers

sudden cries
through the pines
plough of geese

memories
the soot
on the roof tiles

freezing rain
the one who took
the placebo

thanksgiving drive
after the bustle
quiet fields deep shadows

crow caws
in all directions
the endless traffic

january
the wind ruffles
walking crows

night crossing 
salt spray rises
up through the anchor hole

taking his leave
in a winter dream
my oldest friend

autumn moon
turtle crawls
in the sand

a handful of coins
tossed for love magic shifts
in the river depths
where a shaft of sunlight finds
the diving goldeneye

september mist 
someone
i've lost

summer clouds
the steps to the lighthouse
are painted blue

sweet magnolia
spanish moss leans
with the breeze

more darkness
more stars
autumn begins

fall morning
men move lumber
from pile to pile

moonless night
the wet trash bags
reflect the stars

shallow stream
the leaf that bumped my ankle
drifts on

late afternoon
liquidamber leaves
in the hamper

sunlit moon
the whiskey shines
between sips

autumn equinox
salamanders cross the road
from both sides

cicada husk
on the campus sidewalk 
sound of the fountain

a marsh harrier
slow over reed plumes
indian summer

the blues song
in another chord
autumn deepens

wild thoughts 
the late geese
and their bugling

cinco de mayo 
losing my daughter
to the dance floor

temple steps 
a man with a snake
offers to tell my future

mother's day
i cut the long white root
from a carrot

deep in thought
the pitcher plant
wide open

warm day
a koi sways
on her fan

still not tired
to give 
apricot tree

a moment alone
in the desert of iraq
her damaged photo

butterfly garden
a big voice answers
a small one

the day begins
descendants of dinosaurs
darting singing

near the mountain top 
the wind doesn't stay
on the path

sunday afternoon 
end of a dog's leash
whipping through the grass

the long heron a-a-wk
toward a tree
middle of my daydream

tail-flicking cattle
mired mid river
the heat

loons scattering
a floatplane touches down
into summer

moonlit grass
and black shapes of cattle
a distant flute

street fair 
easy to find
the balloon man

road-testing
her electric car
the silence of stars

chilies roasting
the old pickup truck
backfires

getting acquainted
our children
fight over a seashell

summer rain
i walk through the odor
of the sky

sunlit hilltop
she gently sets down
her daisy chain

school closed
fireflies gather
under the willow

this lambent light
over autumn fields
southbound geese

morning glories
butterflies
were they not right here?

no last goodbye
so soundlessly the turtle
returns to the sea

reading her poems
the stillness of hummingbirds
in flight

wind-borne seed
i have
no doubt

a beach dune
drops a little sand
the autumn stars

the first night
the bright star's
below the horizon

news of her death
on the night table
the book unsigned

hummingbird flight
the swiftest movements
are invisible

the last
stair step 
breathing the sky

an empty chair
beside me 
crickets' requiem

softly at first
on a swollen wind
voices in the rain

harp music
wild pear blossoms
in the teacher's window

ebb tide beach
so much to be treasured
left behind

deep in the cedars
walking to the jingle
of our bear bells

rib shadows
on a loping coyote
a field of cut hay

releasing
the day's only catch
summer slips away

autumn afternoon
in the cemetery
every bench taken

river washed stones
remembering a woman
who knew how to love

dry grass
the rattle of ice
in the tea pitcher

summer's end
a crawdad's firm grip
on hotdog bait

shallow river
the boat
at dragonfly speed

garden bench
my warmth left
for the autumn rain

deep night
clocking the moon
by the pine

one leaf's
slow somersaults
oh to start over

grandad's story
candle light flickers
in the snakeskin's eye

north wind
the holes
in my beliefs

valentine's day
i divide
the orange segments

he rolls a smoke
with blunt-tipped fingers
huddled sparrows

winter sun
the spine of one book
out of line

a blizzard outside
i want to believe
what the preacher says

kindling
no time like now
for that first kiss

power breakdown 
a mother nursing
in the dark

canyon winds
pine cones skip
from cliff to cliff

twilight beach 
a full moon rises from
the darkening sea

late summer
one floating leaf
already red

late summer clouds
a light breeze rustles
white hydrangea

first frost
golden foliage holds
the sunlight

a faint silver line
arches the night sky
moonbow!

gray summer sky
seed-beads sparkle
on a blue silk thread

a final splash
while the light holds
golden shafts

clear sky
how much she loved
the color blue

longest day
dipping cornbread
in buttermilk

heat wave
a fly moves slowly
away from my swat

brush fire 
the sun goes down
in flames

withering heat
on the shed's tin roof
green black walnuts

last blackberries
again she playfully
tells me to shush

summer rain
waking to find the tent the size
of a mosquito

random beach stone
imagining
my biography

field of sunflowers 
at the edge a boy
in a yellow hat

summer's end
the wisteria
doubles back

moonrise 
black swans make way
for the rower

opening day
for sidewalk dining 
a waitress pulls weeds

gray tree frogs
calling from the ditch 
wrong side of the tracks

up the mountain
the dog brings
his own ball

starry evening
i can still
make you laugh

river narrows
the pitched call
of an osprey

uptown cafe
she picks the flowers
out of her salad

red campion
the pathway unwinding
so easily

mountain top 
in the valley deep below
death bells

empty farmhouse
a vine wrapped around
the weathervane

damp spring evening
body smells
of the home-coming dog

winter sunrise
slowly
the cockerel finds his voice

deep summer
the sweet-smelling wake
of a hay wagon

winter solstice
the flock of starlings
takes a new shape

looming storm clouds
the stray dog finds
half a ball

parting her wings
for another adventure
ladybug

in the boat house
the sun darts through the holes
in the minnow bucket

behind
a dappled horse
a horse in dappled light

love in the afternoon
the ocean drips on me
from her hair

rainforest
the lives
i step on

i look away
from the cemetery
snow on rainier

old enough
now the willow sings
me to sleep

forest secrets
the mutter and peep
beyond my flashlight

king fisher
glides to roost
dusk over the ocean

as if planning
some miracle
ladybugs in a huddle

cypress bayou
water beetle tracings
catch the light

election poll
a honeybee slides
down the stamen

starlit night
a whiff of perfume
turns the man

green shoots
lark sparrows dustbathe
in wildfire ash

hill walking
i reach the half way mark
in my flask

the good soldier
my ancestor who lived to tell
nothing

distant thunder
the footfall
of bighorn sheep

walnut casket
a nick almost
nobody notices

broken whelk
the silky touch
of inside

shortest day
deep scars
in the cutting board

new year's beach stroll
walking in the footsteps
of my child

disappearing
into winter
birch trunks

lightning within the blizzard
my thoughts
an afterthought

a raven's
singularity
white sky

shadows
in the rabbit's footprints
half moon

winter mist
spirals
of an old sea shell

her diary
between blank pages
rosemary and rue

church concert
sunlight
finds his hands

departing winter
the dead tree's canopy
startles into flight

bog walk
the reflecting pool
in a pitcher plant

basking morass
flapping ears of an elephant
losing tempo

high school reunion
the girls laugh at us
for new reasons

clack of petanque
parrots scattering
over night's edge

otters resting
in the kelp beds
starry night

financial advisors
the orchids in the lobby
real enough

drought
the smell of petrichor
from distant thunder

placid lake
sheen on the back
of a stinkbug

the long pistil
of a hibiscus blossom
lingering heat

a toad high-jumps
through headlight beams
spring cold snap

lime green ridgeline
a rip in the clouds
rains light

spring morning
the short life
of a raindrop

cloud watching
all the rain
in me

crack of dawn
and the small silence
a songbird breaks

scented breeze
the cat emerges
from her paper bag

gentle rain
i remind my mother
to buckle up

young coppice
my father's stick taps
footpath gravel

less future than past
an inchworm tests the void
beyond my fingertip

to-do list
a strand of gossamer
floats free on the wind

a flag
with no country
aurora borealis

after the poem of rain
the prose of mushrooms

inside apples
ripen sooner
still life

daylight moon
the egret folds
itself thin

a scar of mud
where the village stood
dragonflies

mist shreds
the sadness of seas

my own tides
tug of the
near moon

emptying pockets
some of my totems
fall to the floor

gray clouds
the stumbling wasp
in a conifer

frosty fields
dreams that travel
on a morning train

towering clouds
the blue black
of a raven's beak

winter solstice
the whisper of
a turning page

shifting embers
the glow of everyone
breathing

first ice
the muskrat walks
on water

empty night
sound of the toilet
filling up

last bus
the snowman in the bowler
left behind

long hill into town
a semi shifts further into
the night's loneliness

yearly physical
the bare trees
in the window

winter rain
headlines trickle down
a vacant driveway

windblown snowflakes
a mallard lets the river
carry her ashore

club moss
the forest
below the forest

mackerel sky
an upturned horseshoe crab
filled with sand

morning walk
finding coolness
in corn shadows

old barn
a pine eye
lets in the sun

night wind
the bush comes alive
with dreamtime stories

autumn fog
how the doctor clears
his throat

death watch
aspens rattle
at the window

oh god
sunlight
bouncing off the moon

a house on stilts
all night
the wind

forest ravens
call from darkness
inside a dream

summer night
a window shuts
on our conversation

quiet morning
the patio moss soft
beneath my toes

the everywhere
of wild carrot
wayside moon

harmattan sun
a leaf falling
from the tree's shadow

autumn fog
more names added
to the war memorial

saffron moon
shapes of yesterday
in the storyteller's hands

dusk
the scent of pine
in the pages

window fog
i write your name
on the moon

colder
the color leaves take
with them

time travel
red leaves
underfoot

shorter days
the old dog lumbers into
a game of tag

fresh dirt
circles a woodchuck hole
autumn sun

small town parade
the pumpkin queen's
gap toothed smile

distant woodpecker
a pumpkin's innards
on yesterday's news

first snowflakes
the campfire coffee
scorches my tongue

street preacher
i can go
around him

passing
a horse and buggy
cyber monday

following the grain
grandfather's chisel
warms to his palm

a dog's bark
the empty evening
fills the street

brittle moon
the fire
whispers

early frost
smudge pots lit
in the silk-worm shed

the leaves that remain
i close the office door
for the last time

a tap's dripdrip
darkness welling up
in the spaces

winter night
mother and i search
for a pill on the floor

percolating coffee
the tempo of my daughter's feet
beneath the breakfast table

coffee in a mug
warming my hands
yours over mine

child refugee
a handful
of winter sunlight

a bison stretches its neck
the patter of frost
falling from a pine

feeling the silence
sink in
moose tracks in the snow

flood stage
redefining
my boundaries

field stones
the ones pushed away
become a wall

spring morning
the new cat tiptoes up
the length of me

double image
getting both threads
through both eyes

old photography
grandpapa in uniform
has both hands

soft twang
of the old dulcimer
spring cleaning

sudden downpour
the mocking eyes of
a gargoyle

dawn chorus
every bird singing
its dna song

the dream fades
a zebra finch at dawn
singing to her eggs

nightfall
a waft of frangipani
by the pool

hooded merganser
i hold my breath
between each dive

small craft warning
a light chop
in the birdbath

cumulonimbus
time to harvest
the cauliflower

cemetery visit
vines overtake
the silk flowers

husking corn
she talks
of old lovers

slicing red bell pepper
the green heart-bead
tumbles out

seeds of bulrushes
a harrier trails
mist from the marsh

almost autumn
the hum of sunflowers

a wren cowled
in spider silk
autumn morning

a turtle tries
the strawberry bed
egg moon

field of daisies
the white spots
on the fawn's rump

war games
a boy weighs the bantam's egg
in his palm

all the silence
of white crosses

behind bars
the sun's glow
in butterfly wings

summer morning
a garden lizard drinks
the dewdrop on a leaf

unborn child
a veined sea pebble
in her hand

ripening plums
the patience i never quite
got the hang of

penny
on the railroad tracks
summer doldrums

salt pans
the railway line
disappears into sky

the smell of sweat
here comes
the collection plate

muggy evening
the whine
of the battery charger

fireflies
the sparking thoughts
of an insomniac

the longest drought
a coyote nuzzles
the jimson weeds

rain at last!
i ask the piano salesman
to riff a little bach

wing beats
of a pelican
our sails catch the breeze

i open my eyes
from dreams to daydreams
whirligig beetle

a pigeon
cooing circles on the dock
end of summer

evening dusk
the clang of pots and pans
through a marriage

billiard balls
on worn felt
the rain

swallows at dusk
the way her hands
propel the story

the things she carried
in her apron
autumn dusk

smooth cemetery stone
i run my fingers
across her lifetime

dappled sun
the carousel stops
on a high note

new ice
the pattern of
small grudges

childhood summers
the weight of a
goldfinch

her apron strings
now tied around my waist
mother's day

persimmons
the opossum grins
with fifty teeth

sweltering night
a hole in the backyard
bleeds scorpions

winter milking
my cheek fits the warm curve
of cow

silence
for some
includes birdsong

autumn rain
nothing left of the gull
but its voice

winter birds
all my hopeful
doubt

old memories
a bellflower folds
around a bee

pond light on birch bark
the dream leaves
the way it arrives

thin harvest
i salt the bitterness
out of the gourd

cheshire moon
the arc of
a wall calendar's rod

nowhere to be
the sharpness of sorrel
on my tongue

last day of school
the new boy offers to take
the turtle home

water lilies
our days
in the sun

roasting sun
the egret's measured steps
in buffalo shadow

heartland
the world winnowed down
to wheat

insomnia
length of the night
on her knitting needles

receding tide
the gasps of
little shells

the age of the river
a ripple in stone

dusk
where wild apples
have rolled to a stop

keep this
toss that
spring

end of the world
i blow apart
a dandelion

spring fever
the turtle's neck
at full stretch

nevertheless
fall colors

the housemaid
shakes her mop outside
cherry blossoms

one step farther
than i wanted to go
spring wind

spring thaw
what i meant
to tell her

cicada shell
our ten-year-old says
he'll never leave home

vernal equinox
the bend of an elbow
out a car window

her persian carpet
before mourners
disrupt the pattern

equinox
a scent of light
on snow

you don't know
until it's past
last frost

on the horizon
just enough cloud
to hold some sunset

late autumn sun
every single object
tied to its shadow

the steam
that never left the kettle
water again

shallow brook
first snow settles on a stone
above the water

flight path of the geese
soon forgotten by all
but the geese

for company
the snow crunch underfoot
winter solstice

losing hold
of where home is
gift shop seahorses

spring
digging up
the memory of earth

learning to eat
around bruises
winter apples

lost dog
i leave my voice
in every street

spring wind
a young sheepdog
skedaddles the lambs

dragonfly
resting on my paddle
we will drift a while

my world
sits on my lap

old horses
days of endless rain
in their eyes

night time
in the hospice aquarium
the pulse of fish gills

leap year
once a year my brother dies
no matter what

picasso
i see different wife
my in a way

not knowing
when i'll want it back
winter wind

above all
the finch's song

gathering clouds
the clack of a clam
on an otter's stone

this world's
long shadow
blood moon

shortest day
spare parts
in a box

a password
to access my passwords
the hummingbird's tongue

her death date
i pause the river
in my cupped hands

darkness
i lock
myself in

spring equinox
a change in the melody
of melting ice

wren songthe width
of now

ultrasound scan
i rearrange
my dreams

winter solitude
my chess move marked
return to sender

huckleberries
picking through
my boyhood

fresh rocks from
the potato field

ocean wind
salt
for the busker's cup

shine in the sun
osprey's nest

still waters
a thousand scoters
wing to wing

i add a leaf
to the table

how to spell
the nuthatch's call

still unpacking
a pair of wrens
in the long grass

honeybees sway
on the snowdrops
one of her good days

mallards swim
in the aqueduct
he's family now

taking me farther
from frog songs

piercing my bones

snowflakes
a frog-shaped stone
by the pond

i postpone
the first sip

in the fajita

from last night

to march sunlight

of the antler

the gnarled trunk
of an olive tree

against the blue sky
my retirement plan

the deer races
its shadow

only mother here now

owing money
my hands smell
of old pennies

winter rain
a glimpse of unpainted wall
behind a radiator

low battery
i hold on to her fading voice
awhile longer

snow falling 
through the night
a crow's white throat

digging out after the blizzard
a crow's voice merges
with the creaking pine

ice storm ended
the height of a short man's
slam dunk

hunger
the metallic taste
of winter wind

pencil pine
the last of the sun
angles away

summer evening
dusk falling
through the skylight

rice field
all these extra prayers
become stars

an undertone
to the orchid's scent
somewhere a clock

coconut grove
leaf blades comb
the moonlight

alpine lake
my breast stroke's shining arc
toward sunrise

spruce woods
fireweed filling
the vacancy

corrugated sun
chilies and laundry
in rooftop haze

we ease out
the champagne corks

fading stars
stones on the beach
wet with dew

his promised
return
paper airplane

escorting
a dead dragonfly
100 undertakers

grain of the wood
their conversation
at the viewing

deep fog
a sax returns the call
of a tug horn

scent of applewood
pork bellies
in the smokehouse

eagle cloud
the mistral's breath
in my bones

eagle sighting
the passing trucker and i
share a thumbs-up

first frost
the scent of coffee reaching
a little further

the randomness
of where things fall
red maples

winter night
the big dipper
spills darkness

learning who
not to listen to
snowy mountains

our reflections
in the watchmaker's window
winter stars

skylight moon
my unspoken need
for boundaries

after paragraph
winter fly

the peanut butter sandwich
left unmade

a jogger's ponytail
bobs up and down

reading the snowman's
body language

the smoothness
of a kidney bean

a change
on my mammogram
snow moon

the slow progress
of the search boats

when i would practice
how to fly

the orange underbelly
of a slug

a screech owl's nest
in the breach

to sing

around my waist

from the spring sky

just for a moment
i understand

wanting to hear the voices
of the blooming things

the brown calf
breaks into a trot
spring breeze

the warm shadow within
the thanksgiving turkey

exploding
in our happy faces
giant snowflakes

another exception
to the rule
dried persimmons

long night
the fine print
of contraindications

christmas train
travelling with
the child within

another year
the odds and ends
of her crazy quilt

my thoughts too
have lost their foliage
winter night

russian birches
tracks of trotting turkeys
in the snow

winter squall
the bittersweet
fills with starlings

sleepless night
learning the shape
of darkness

midnight
the sunflowers
still facing west

onawa lake
a selfie
with the stars

holding still
hoping to see what's here
when i'm not

family secrets
a moss-covered stonewall
in the deep woods

seashell collection
gran whispers the name
of the child she lost

brown mimosa pod
a secret
yet to be shared

a snail shell
in the letterbox

end of summer
teaching kids to count
from lightning to thunder

star shower
the same wish over
and over again

hoot of an owl
poe
by flashlight

chill morning
the apple-tree magpie
fluffs its chest

the softness
of a gunshot
opening day fog

constant rain
i can smell
the gray of my horse

gray afternoon
the amber eyes
of nobody's cat

silent night
carolers wrapped
by their own fog

evening shadows
she grows tired
of snow angels

how my signature
trails off
funeral guestbook

tea
all the time
it takes

sleepless night
the silent shuffle of cards
on the touchscreen

fading light
sunday boats
thread the inlet

a gharial glides over
its own footprints

wheeling gulls
the crooked path
to the shipwreck

river bus
somebody always
waves back

distant hill
a swallowtail butterfly
obscures the view

ripening wheat
the broodmare's belly
ripples

prayer flags
the coming and going
of el niã±o

high tide
the heron's easy balance
on the last rock

summer afternoon
the faint breeze
of my baby's breath

each maple
at its own pace
lengthening days

first crocus
last christmas napkin
under my mug of tea

from       puddle
to       puddle
street lamps

falling plum blossoms
the nightingale now singing
for another tree

crabapple stump
every sucker
in bloom

a bud
with no bumblebee
the sleeping infant

spring girls
the boys rear
their bikes

a bee landing on
my painted nail

the shadow of a petal
on a petal

the deity wrapped
in spider silk

leaving by train
for the last time
raindrops on the oder

ducks on the river

warm to the touch
summer's end

hemlock lean
portioning
an evening

night crickets
the rescue dog
unleashed

rock shelter
a shepherd's song
sings back to him

dense fog
the light of a lighthouse
fading in the sea

movement of stars
the golden wattle blossom
lit by the moon

northerly wind
the runes of gulls' footprints
in the damp sand

not one dog
answers the siren
deep winter

cogwheel train belching smoke
up a mountain pass
speckled snow

caribou block the road
my husky sings
an ice-age song

the bright edge
of a falling axe
low winter sun

quiet day
i add nothing to
the ramen pack

sculpture park
every raven
a critic

the night rain
another dream
i don't remember

winter grass
the neither here nor there
of walking in the rain

fields still dark
the farmer warms his hands
on a cow's flank

the final hymn
pushing through open windows
fragrance of lilacs

water music
an otter
slips in

beyond the gate
with white paint peeling
the summer sea

shimmer
what herring make
of ocean and sunlight

fragments of a dream
the rattle of stones
in a receding wave

tide pool
the searchable world
we live in

parade's end
a trombone
outside the portaloo

a screen door's bang
flies on a melon
lift and settle

among the switch cane
starry night

graveyard shift
a shark-tank cleaner slipping
into chain mail

roadside
books
in a fish tank

four-way stop
everyone yields
to the tumbleweed

paddleboat
the in-laws
switch sides

jet boat
a river cut
white

mossy wall
the fear that father
put in me

the darkness
shrinking into me
sunrise

moment of silence
a quarter twist
of the crow's head

sidewalk mica
memories a little brighter
in winter light

old hymns
posts and beams
intertwined

bookstore cafã©
finding my voice
in the babel

a jukebox nickel
mom's lipstick on a crushed
cigarette

a thistle's tip
crumbles easily
winter cemetery

whispering
in the red fox's ear
snowflake

sub-zero
the soft chatter
of ice-clad branches

long garlic germ
between my fingers
end of winter

night shift
the passage of the moon
from window to window

long rain
lost in thought
i grow older

tenth year commuting
still i spot a weathered house
in the distant field

indian summer
festival flags
limp on their lines

the ruddy legs
of the practice squad
fall rain

the bowed bench
of the picnic table
autumn leaves

after the fox
twice blighted
tomatoes

all that's left
of the evening
pumpkin soup

twilight dusk
the course of starlings
into stars

suburban darkness
only the rumble
of garbage can wheels

alone by the river
the one flat stone
that feels right

mallard ducklings
from the riverbank
a scent of fennel

blink of an eye
the distance between
a finch and my cat

crossing the line
between maybe and yes
double rainbow

beachside bench
my breath slowing
to the waves' rhythm

rain riffled garden
rimmed with marigolds
her storybook lion

filled with cezanne's
shadows and light
a fresh-picked pear

scent of lemongrass
her finger traces
the milky way

full moon
the pontoon shifting
with the tide

spring morning
the basket of clean socks
all pair up

mist all day
living only
in the foreground

an eastern breeze
meets a western
mating ducks

broad daylight
in the hawk's talons
a park ave pigeon

dragon kite
the boy rides a dive
in a gusty wind

pregnant daughter
a muscle of minnows
changing the current

white wisteria
honeybees
queue at the hive

last ship off the island
the nun hoeing vegetables
briefly looks up

nightfall
the scent of lilac
between raindrops

snow mixes with rain
my mother keeps calling me
by my brother's name

headstones
butterflies move
through the silence

sent back out
for something i forgot
winter stars

cold snap
the rattle of a rake
over stones

high noon
a cat stares down
the chipmunk's hole

approaching storm
a nest of yellowjackets
in the scarecrow's belly

gray morning
the weight of mist
in spanish moss

an empty shell
rolled back and forth by the waves
winter sunset

at the end
i wash my teapot
new year's eve

morning tea
from the parakeet’s cage
a toy bell tinkles

snow covered field
the impressions
of angels

another stair
the weight of my daughter’s
college bags

remembrance day
the thin sound of a bugle
wavers in the rain

leafless trees
and beyond them leafless trees
and the highway

the bobcat
the doe
only my eyes move

uphill trail
the scarred trunk
of a giant sequoia

empty corner
slowly the moon leaves
the dust

autumn afternoon
the tombstone
strapped to a dolly

slave cemetery
the tug of the current
on willow fronds

stone garden 
this morning the islands
float on snow

wood sorrel
a bumblebee works
the last patch of sun

slicing apples
into the dented pan 
howl of the wind

on the roof
with a row of mops
soaking up the sun

thoughts of youth 
the furthest peak
through my slingshot

darkness
i lock
myself in

ash wednesday
the hollow between
her collar bones

morning light
the cucumbers have claimed
new territory

darkness
i lock
myself in

the darkness
i lock
myself in

her fairy tale
in first person
spring rain

turbulent stream
the water moves
the ripples stay

egg moon
the emu's contours
engraved in stone

with each hop
of the waterline crow
a lifting of teal

cut flowers
a child asks
if they bleed

spring butterfly
the little boy's shadow
first to reach it

a paper cross
for the dead butterfly
takes flight

ragged jonquils
the old cemetery
with her baby's grave

redwings return
the smell of grass
in the rain

mother's day
one of the orchids
reblooming

harvest moon rising
the smell
of his new jaguar

after rain
the yellow of gorse
the black of slate

small town
the only light
is red

returning home
after living abroad
the smell of thyme

old barn
the scent of jerseys
and bailer twine

first chill
i wonder about
yesterday's bee

traded
for persimmons
acupuncture

a harrier low
over the silver-blues
of the evening marshes

harbour quay
the sound of a tugboat
wrapped in fog

another winter
the welcome mat
worn thin

winter zoo
a gorilla turns
its back to the crowd

swirling wind
the salty tongue
of my snow boot

winter's last rain
the scent of skunk
in my eyes

the sound
of meltwater
wood frogs

open cage
the breast feather left behind
flutters

spring equinox
scraping off the shovel
with the hoe

frosted furrows
an old mare's whinny
silvers the air

painted bunting
its shadow
still black

clouds fringed with rain
the pony's pregnant belly
brushes sweet clover

solstice rain
the day begins and ends
with juncos

a wren's small talk
after the clamour of corellas

weeding the garden
at what age did i learn
to walk between the rows?

the search
for pop bottles
a long afternoon

solitude
the night deepens
with every firefly

summer storm
circus elephants lean
into the thunder

low tide
barnacles armored
against the air

sunrise
a generation of fruit
flies

purple lilly-pillys
the garden hose drips
into twilight

as if this sky
weren't sky enough
indigo bunting

the sky
on a morning lake
that perfect lotus

moorland path
the sun mining
foxglove scent

today's forecast
cloudy with a chance
of jalapenos

sundown
swallowing the oyster
juice and all

a wing
in each world
the stingray breaks the surface

chigger bites
my finger traces
the wilderness map

at the cemetery
by moonlighttalking
with shadows

walking at night
my imagination
follows me home

water-tower shadow
extending
a small town's loneliness

summer storm
a clothespin bag bobs
on the line

low tide seaweed
wigeon and bufflehead
dine separately

hospice
she asks me to bring back
a shell from the sea

the scent of fruit
past ripening
dusk light

perseid shower
the scent of tamarack
on the campfire

dying moon
the arc of a bush moth
into the light

august heat
cracked dirt in the shape
of a puddle

blistered thumb
the corn a little sweeter
this year

venus rising
i linger a little longer
in the hot tub

lake sunset
a blackbird's call
wobbles the cattails

fog in the redwoods
the jazz station cuts out
near the summit

under the red leaves
the rungs of the fish ladder
silvered by salmon

tattered basketball net
clinging to a rusted rim
my childhood home

single mother
rocking her baby
rocking herself

cathedral at night
an electron circles
the nucleus

gibbous moon
my ear on the curve
of her belly

button jar
all he knows
of grandma

learning to weave
one breath between us
the long night

it begins
a galaxy of dust motes
in the projector's beam

the dinosaur museum
i have to be there
for the grandchildren

torrential rains
urchins cheer their paper boats
into the gutter

eclipse
our wedding rings
one inside the other

home alone
i enter the crawl space
of a younger self

clear sky
a bouncy castle
inflating

barefoot
the bride wrings seawater
out of her train

boatside ripples
in the summer sunset
minnows rising

out-going tide
the little portion
a shell retains

supermoon
my son changes into
pajamas with a cape

ancient temple
the guide's voice lost
amid selfie clicks

demolished houses
a cricket's song
somewhere

moon in the pines
i lather what's left
of the soap

swinging bridge
raindrops hang
on the tips of ferns

evening fog
antlers ghosting through
the coulee

sunset
debating rothko's
use of red

taking down
the lost cat flyers
first frost

wild horse muster
steaming flanks
in a biting frost

night wind
a freight train's horn
blows through my dream

winter night
too cold to hold
the star chart

icicles
a thread of light
from the street lamp

a sheet of ice
clings to a black alder's limb
the unpaired mallards

snow melt
small carcasses
frozen in place

plum blossoms
making the most
of a new religion

drizzling rain
my reflection
in the hearse

daybreak
a farmer taps the goose's head
on the way to the barn

with a pink crayon
she points the way
cherry petals

below the rapids
the river
disentangles

winter solstice
one egg short
of a pudding

a quart of oil
for the journey
christmas eve

north woods
a fir deep in each
constellation

winter concert
the way the mallets strike
the xylophone

orange marmalade
the last time mother
knew my name

midnight
nobody's name
to whisper

my grandpa's house
so many love stories
walled in here

quiet night
the cookie jar's marble lid
opening

venus overhead
wolf tracks crisscross
in the snow

the thumbprint
of tollund man
deep winter

november morning
the barn's shadow meets
the frost line in the meadow

peeling clapboards
a snow flake settles
on the pink flamingo

rising breath
gran reaches for branches
with snow-laden cones

ice storm
bishop takes knight
by candlelight

solstice
the darkness
of the wind

cold dawn
the old ford turns over
once

christmas eve
brand new seed
in the feeder

snowed in
after the pina colada
dreaming in color

an owl's
daytime hoots
lunar eclipse

winter stars
prayer candles burn
in an empty church

so suddenly winter
baby teeth at the bottom
of the button jar

mountain moonrise
the sound i didn’t know
i had in me

christmas far from home 
the odor of hay and manure
from an open barn

boys killing a snake
because it's a snake
dust devil

sagebrush
the scuffed patina
of well-worn boots

unfolding
a crisp map of labrador
the heat

travel brochures
leafing through
time away from time

our garden path
that wobbly stepping stone
always so

low tide
the baby's foot hanging out
of a buggy

long afternoon
the mahout sleeps
in elephant shadow

bull rake
the tall tales
a clam digger tells

jazz pianist
the notes on and off
the page

twilight breeze
gossip wafts
from stoop to stoop

start of fall
across three parking spaces
a runaway penny

mackerel sky
the fishing boat
now only a dot

stump speech
one cloud
then another

a broad nest
littered with fish bones
twilight thunder

stone fruit
this letter to be opened
after his death

his yellow kayak
hangs from the rafters
another year passing

hospice
a glimpse of moonlight
on the bed

news of her decline
i wonder if my suit
is black enough

cricket song
the vastness of fields
in the gloom

starlight through the window
you left behind
your fingerprints

4am quiet
the world starts
outlining itself

rusted little fence
around grandmother's grave
my one memory

dried corn stalks
missing the neighbor
i never spoke to

mostly cloudy
waving to a stranger
i thought i knew

name tag
the scarlet oak
introduces itself

foreclosure
the skull of something
in the crawlspace

autumn twilight
the last pill
sticks to my tongue

juncos
along a stone wall
the wind chill factor

cold night
the smart phone
rejects my touch

winter solstice
the reverse side
of the needlepoint

a freshened cup
of morning coffee
the obituaries

oolong
pekoe
tasting each sound

gray dawn
under the table all night
the missing puzzle piece

beyond the child's reach
a brown leaf
somersaulting through the park

countdown to spring
paint swatches
in the glove box

softening snow
the small pink tongue
of a pika

holding faith
for the moment
crocus leaves

rippled water
i see mother's cursive
in mine

birthday tulips
always the one
head bowed

waking up
to easter day
trumpet lilies

august doldrums
nothing to disturb
the pond scum

deep water
the heart-shaped stone
still there

the tickle of bristles
i cover-up
my hickey

sunset under sunset
the tide leaves a mirror
in the sand

evening swim
the moon
becomes her

moonlit walk
my shadow surfs
the perfect waves

milky way
at the edge
the sound of katydids

late summer
swallows threading
the dark

corn field
my son scans the sky
for a ufo

fading summer
still humming the hymn
night mosquitos

last of the snow
a tree shakes out
its parakeets

the wind says so much
with so little
tumbleweed

last dregs of snow
along the shore
a coxswain's call

the watchtower guard
has the best view
plum blossoms

spring snow
i tried to warn
the daffodils

the value
of little white lies
apricot blossoms

contented baby
the pond dimpled
with light spring rain

nest-building
a redbird chits at the nail guns

winter
the light at the edge
of a locked door

of black eyed peas

border mountains
the morning sun glints
off spent shells

therapist's waiting room
orchid buds
ready to open

smell of a christmas tree
at the curb

winter hills
with each boot crunch
the scent of sage

ten below zero
a pileated woodpecker
cracks open the day

i wake into
her warmth

staring into space
a winter fly
spirits me away

a different me wants
a different you

blossom wind
the geometry
of strangers

not enough words
for green

warblers
a few ounces of gold
in the willows

i have to do

paring down
to one junk drawer

a mud-drenched clump
of blue mussels

headstone
my face reflected
in the plaque

late afternoon sun
a fine layer of pollen
on the greenhouse roof

daybreak
a ruffled feather
falls from the sky

living alone
a centipede under
the flowerpot

bee-loud morning
the scent
of orange blossom

older marriage
the gentle choreography
of breakfast

all those decades
of billowing gauze emptying
into our room

on starvation ridge
dry with the breeze

after the muezzin's call
a market din turns off
shed by shed

before guests arrive

scent of lemon
from the hotel soap

a lizard's ribs pressed
against concrete

some of its color
remains in the leaves

with the godwits

the way a duck flies
the way a crow flies
autumn twilight

pings the milk pail

of snowfall

with flashes of squid

of a flame

in the leaves

his end of summer song

to meet the stars

from here the sea
shows its age

the smooth wake
of a squid boat

with my shadow

among white stones

against the walk

in the fairy ferns

her own gladioli
on the altar

on loden cloth

with each drip

before the rain
scent of roses

across the pasture

from the center of a pine stump
a pine

into one-way

she pops seafroth bubbles
with her lips

after the burial
my eyes on the shadows
of everything

turns in the fire
all hallow’s eve

funeral procession
the stillness of cotton blossoms
in sunlight

all that is left
of the mist
memorial stones

she folds and unfolds
her layoff notice

in her hair

preoccupied
my hand fills with
dog nose

calling the cows home
on new year's
they all come

parkas
out shopping
for a wedding dress

spilt milk
spreading along the grout lines
morning chill

from fresh mud
the white moth rises
early spring!

a persistant whistle
in the grosbeak's song
the fading moon

election day
the whales chose
to go south

daisies gone
counting votes with a mum
bush, gore, bush, gore

another news flash
of who won the election
thunder and lightning

made but unknown
the will of the people
petals in a bud

a wind from the south
scatters petals

the mother cat licks
each kitten

some say they can fly
to a bush

reflected from her
pink toe nails

into it

underwater
her nakedness

the cool dark
her cry echoes
among the gulls

dawn
stepping outside i step inside
a new day

stars fade
in the tide pool
starfish remain

a crab quickly
buries itself
harsh sea gull cry

in atlantic green

full of stars

into his hat
new widower

floral sheets
beside me
winter sun

longest day
three page letter
to myself

tv rugby
can't stop my legs
from running

withered field
straw woman's
glitter scarf

morning stillness
the white orchid growing
in a coconut husk

fog lifting
a mahout talks
to his elephant

a piercing cry
from the early street
brooms! brooms!

waiting for the ashes
the mourner feeds
a temple dog

11 a.m.

the dog's rice bowl

a basket of mangoes
and a banana flower

under the lettuce tree

toward the river

in the pond
stone heron

warmed by april sun
i trace her name

replaying the tape
of her dear voice
mother’s day

a drinking song echoes
from the castle wall

snug in his lawn chair
a set of single sheets
flutters on the line

november birthdays
the new jersey turnpike
is younger than me

stubbled fields
their scarecrow tucked
in the crook of a tree

heat
between sighs, the squeak
of corn growing

business lunch
he idly rubs a bruise
on the apple

prayers for a friend
the autumn butterfly clings
to my fingertip

japanese garden
my son places a stone
to divide the stream

no rolling waves
no wind in the wheat
but a dry whisper

long shadows
crow with broken wing
keeps its distance

in the wake
of the ellis island ferry
hungry gulls

restless night
the morning starts
without me

daguerreotypes
searching for my child’s frown
in those stern faces

nothing to declare
father's ashes
in the carry-on bag

his ashes
the feeling of
finding a nail

unseen birds crying
we shake father's ashes
into the river

withered grasses
at the hilltop
the sky begins

the spider swings
on a window
- november rain

cold snap
the smell of mothballs
on my flannels

misty morning
slow steps even slower
in web-strewn grass

calm morning
a kayak adrift
in clouds

moonlit pier
the sparkle of fish scales
on calloused hands

nearly dusk
the zigzag flight
of linked dragonflies

glassy pond
a new ringlet
with each rain drop

autumn rain
i set off in search
of brightness

thawing me
love words
written on ice

fields
in blossom
i give away my poem

a flash of sun
between storm clouds
church bells

first sunrise
a bag lady sifts
through the trash

grandma's kitchen
the smell of apple pie
and linament

in parasol shade
we salt green apples
have we been married so long

the burned-out barn
rain goes into cracks
to freeze

papers to fill out
he never needed paper
to start a fire

tree farm
unsold aspen
shed their leaves

the sound of
my new leather jacket
as i breathe

the hermit
playing chess
by internet

windy night
at a distance the warmth
of a neighbor's porch light

through a haze
of leaflets--the ugliest gargoyle
ever

where the small lake
leaks away
a tea-dark gurgle

thanksgiving
the weaver pulls
her nest apart

memories
a blue dragonfly flits
past the window

light drizzle
four mousebirds tip
a bamboo shoot

the odour of sweat
mixed with grain dust
coffee break

inmates paid
to replace railroad ties
no one runs

up to his ears
in soft, white snow
jackrabbit

autumn frost
windfall apples
glisten

city children
bobbing red apples
grandmother's washtub

pale beneath a winter sky
robin eggs

cotton fields
the only white left
is the snow

end of the chain
an angel's dance
with the ceiling fan

useless map
it doesn't tell us anything
about the fog

a fine september
even yellow jackets  drunk
on late blackberries

first dream alive
he runs in circles barking
through the falling snow

abandoned farm
the broken birdhouse
fills with snow

still soft and white
mom's old letter
on birch bark

cold december
our jolly trashman
all in red

this year’s first bill
his swiftness in taking down
25000 lights

at her grave
he digs moss
from his name

in the underground garage
the latest car's rain
with petals

lent sunrise
at the river the shine
of icecoated thorns

first light
peeling
an orange

old handshake
each searches the face for the face
of years ago

breaking bread
two franciscans bicker
like old brothers

morning glories
a smell of newness
as i hold the baby

summer lethargy
the ambulance speeds by
on a towtruck

lightning flash
a lizard darts between
perfume bottles

green and white lanterns
under the cedars
snowdrops

christmas tree -hanging memories
one by one

gray sea and sky
she dreams
of blue irises

no one remembers
that afternoon
sheets laid for love

by one bed
at the hospice
daily red rose

an artist
mixing red
the first robin

full-blown tulips
the nurse replaces
an iv bag

summer haze
a long wake curls ashore
lifting a frog

museum buddha
wood-grain swirls
replace stolen gilt

the mill wheel
has stopped again-those dam beavers

the fire engine
that passed me up
turns into my house

to highway 10
so much shorter
on the map

dusk
the stillness of swans
in a flooded field

spring sun
in the shadow of a bucket
a black button

in spring sun
a glimpse of blue
the magpie

the widow's short skirt,
gossips discuss who
wanted the divorce

blown lavender bells
of the empress paulownia
nowhere to step

ducks and geese glide
to floating bits of bread
the cat’s eyes so round

crescent moon
near a half-eaten mouse
a cheshire sleeps

mountain
the shadow spreading
on water

a breeze
ripples the pond
warbler's song

umbrellas fail
to keep off the rain
kyoto in june

blustery day
safe behind shutters
the storm within

our heads
touching the tatami
landlords and tenants

only the bark left
on age-old apple trees
yet they blossom

overgrown garden
only on the balcony
are flowers not eaten

first autumn storm
on the small tree
not one leaf left

deserted farm
only silence
grows here

bullfrog song
the color
of dusk

full moon
bats diving in and out
of the lake mist

sun
on the dead grass
a fleck of tinfoil

wind through the field
the birds stop
whistling

sunset
sinking into pines
sparrows

after the funeral
suddenly smothered
in silence

white line of light
peace lilies

dusk
white petals of camellias
light the way

sunless sky
the pomelo tree
with one golden fruit

roof-top puddle
the seagull takes off
with a spray

first grass sprout
over father’s grave
tenderness of wind

summer afternoon
the scent of evergreens
slowly spreading

starry night
frost patterns grow
from the window's edge

meadow song
the swirling dance
of thistledown

woodland solitude
deepening with dusk
the hoot of an owl

midnight stars
our stroll through the neighborhood
trips light after light

afternoon drizzle
a few winter oranges
deep in the grass

five or six
grandson takes the clock apart
to see what time is

rainy spell
the cat's shape flattens
into deeper sleep

twilight breeze
reeling in some lake weeds
with the big-mouth bass

wild azaleas
a meadowlark sings
into the scent

a sheltered path
fairy lilies
now and then

early autumn
the path to the waterfall
willowed with gold

turning for home
the road north curves upward
full of sun

so lonely tonight
walking slowly against
windrivenrain

in dark shadows
the forgotten old man
and a piece of bread

carried by the wind
a gnat has flown
into a swallow’s bill

abandoned dog
following
the beggar

my children
fishing in the rain barrel
not one bite

although she's gone
her dolls
still listening

summer wind
tall grass
brushes the moon

hazy headwaters
pale green dusk and the willow
blend into one

wind in the reeds
full moon
in the loblolly pine

changing a bike tire
the kitten watches me
through still spokes

sand painting
the cat steps out
of its litter box

bare feet
in fresh mud
dancing in the rain

on the roof
a million stars
close enough to touch

home alone
i listen to a meadowlark
mimicking itself

plowing day
a pale cloud passes
the tractor

noon sun
a black bug
digs a hole

bouquet of lilies
in a cellophane prison
a wandering bee

lights out
before the air raid
bright moon

seller's thundering voice
the redness
of sliced watermelon

deserted alley
heavy anger of his fist
against the old brick

hot still night
the endless chirping cricket
of the neighbor's fan

gulls
each body pointed
into the wind

pond grasses
tips reach out
to watery twins

rainsnakes
wiggling through
window-framed blossom

curled snakeskin
warm from the dirt road
fits in my palm

a gypsy boy
sharing given bread
with the pigeons

dark shelter
i step on
a child's toy

peacock's tail
in the spring sunshine
goldsmith's shopwindow

paul bunyan
whole headlines
in the paper-mache

summer camp
my bunkmate
believes in ghosts

in the other room
my brother recites my poems
for laughs

asking directions
from strangers
my home town

clay path
bootprints fill
with orange rain

mammogram waiting room
she rips a page
from a magazine

blue sky
i almost miss
the morning glory

cat's grave
violet shades of evening
merge into night

still morning
only the sound
of my tinnitus

diving into the wreck
those winter sundays
the wasteland

empty mcdonald's bag
i still feel
empty

pulling in the nets
letting baby crabs go

writing a check
warmth of the counter
where the last patient leaned

signing our wills
the lawyer's sheep
munch leaves

her eulogy
he twists each thorn
from a long-stemmed rose

picking sweetpeas
a tiny spider swings
from a strand of light

falling leaves
a butterfly flits
over the electric fence

old age home
an african violet blooms
on every windowsill

competing with the priest
a choir
of birdsong

japanese lanterns
the ticking of
soft rain

farmer pointing the way
with a shotgun

dimly lit
brightly iiluminated
the book of kells

foggy new year's
crows hopping on and off
a sea lion carcass

the bluebird
in the sky
lost to it

on the wall
meeting its older self
the ivy

pulling its sound
through a tunnel
the midnight train

the dark eyes
of a panda
new year's day

one year
becomes another
driftwood

attic sun
from grandmother's gown
a grain of rice

stream-split forest
the walls hold mist
and darkness

light fades
before the summer storm
a finch cracks a seed

autumn afternoon
only loonsong
crosses the forest

a butterfly flits
from branch tip to branch tip
lifting mist

a bird rustles
deep inside the fig tree
raindrops

lunar eclipse
the cat watches us
watch the moon

watery eyes
dust from the new boy
clapping erasers

busy receptionist
one of her false eyelashes
comes unglued

shotgun blast
the snow deepens
between stones

rest home newsletter
again the puzzle page
with no answer key

first snow
he's out to the schoolbus
in one long slide

headed south
the first magnolia
slows me down

everyone has gone
a forgotten mitt
catches the rain

the last spring moon
a shelved book falling
of its own accord

pine forest
half a smooth river stone
where there is no trail

hunter’s moon
waves lap the woman
carved in the rock

snowflakes fill
the eye of the eagle
fallen totem pole

egypt disappoints
she saw the pyramids
in vegas

secondhand store
reclaiming me
our give-away cat

i too am alone
between swift currents
old river rock

winter morning
are those two ravens
reunited lovers?

ski lift
the kissing couple
miss their stop

sunday morning
again the organist
off key

crowded mall
the little girl asks santa
what he wants for christmas

snowdrifts
by the dyer's hut
eight shades of blue

red pagoda
in swirling snow
the muffled gong

lingering sunlight
the last bouquet
of queen anne's lace

a crowded mall
so many coins
in the fountain

the passing
of a dance instructor
my favorite moves

wind
through the car window
a butterfly

grandchild's
small hand giant maple leaf

summer porch
painting her toe nails pink
also the dog's

in the shade
old men play checkers
the mockingbird's repertoire

running downhill
into fragrance of
fresh mown hay

another day of rain
old puddles
joining together

early fog
it reveals then hides
the pines

winter pool
the sheen of suntan oil
on the shallow end

early twilight
snow enters the barn
on the backs of cows

the magnolia
releases a petal's worth
lavender shade

lost at last
even this sunrise
a complete mystery

lamplight on snow
i
am going home

through two sets
of windows
moonlight in a doll's house

stars
a flat roof
waiting for me

damp morning
below a second story window
the smashed tv

outside the home
in her wheelchair
smoking

the carnations
of wang chi now dust
still their scent

canal street
the smell of prayer books
and old wine

a drawn cart
on the cobblestones
hay and dung

puddles
near the train station
shivering moons

first day
the anhinga's spread wings
fill with light

this overdue letter
a speckled moth
lights on my thumb

family reunion
all the men's shirt fronts
hug-wrinkled

year’s end
letting his belt out
another notch

on the beach
the balloon man
pops kelp bladders

pot luck
assigned alphabetically
i bring oranges

cloudless sky
she cranks up
the big white umbrellas

wind in the canopy
waiting
to feel it

dog day afternoon
a lemon seed
up through the straw

hot parking lot
the old man wanders
with a watermelon

fishing trip
animal crackers go
two by two

mountain pines
two brothers scatter
his ashes

quiet house
the chess game
where we left it

last patch of snow
where the mountain slopes
wild violets

march morning
ten winter-furred horses
turned toward the sun

rolling blackouts
shining through bare branches
the moon

end of the day
a persimmon turning
a deeper orange

sunset
in waikiki beach
yellow hibiscus

home again
the souvenir tshirt
a size too small

exhaling
the worm is on the hook

first cold day
arguing again
over the thermostat

this quiet morning
even the bar of soap
falls apart

without consent
my old sneakers
in the trash

after her letter
no heart to open
a bill

eucalypt saplings
filling each shade patch
one kangaroo

sitting alone
she draws patterns
in the spilled drink

carnival parade
refusing to march
behind the horses

ebb tide
the dark water
carries the moon away

starry night
biting into a melon
full of seeds

nightfall
through bare branches
slivers of moon

gray sea and sky
she dreams
of blue irises

christmas tree
hanging  memories
one by one

now just a line
of pinpoints on her ears
soup kitchen

home from hospital
spinning the bicycle wheel
just for its sound

still night pond
the waterbug
scattering stars

in the window
a cat stalks
her reflection

calling my children
a long-distance overdose
of nickelodeon

after the storm
each droplet on my window
a rainbow

too busy sleeping
to notice the rain

a hawk circles above
ignoring the traffic
or perhaps stalking it

at the pawn shop
a tarnished wedding band
priced for quick sale

a lamp crashes to the floor
the sound of padded feet

gazing into
an open field
daydreaming of trains

passing train
overtaken
by the tea kettle

segovia’s guitar
the sweet arpeggio
of rain

more fleeting than your kiss this shadow
on the moon

monday morning
guess who forgot
to buy the coffee?

her smile
like the letter she clutches
isn’t mine.

slow dance
of the setting moon
another sleepless night

interview day meandering trails
of perfume

suburban lullaby the steady din
of the freeway

awakened by
the lilac breeze
of perfume

long meeting
so tired
of doodling

the plane lifts off
sudden thunder
and a trail of words

reading kafka
i pause
to kill a fly

spotting the deer
a butterfly perches
on my rifle barrel

on my dashboard
dried flowers
that were meant for you

sparrows
erupt from the trees
the sound of thunder

waiting for her call
i stare
at thunderclouds

the lights go out
replaced
by lightning

finally
a breeze
before the storm

rough day at work i rescue a fly
from a spider web

imminent storm
i can feel
the darkness

after the rain
rainbows swirl
in streetside puddles

same time as yesterday
a bee overlooks
my plastic rose

overlooking the lake
steam rises
from my tea

turning on the fan
a shower of rose petals

passing train
the ice cubes in my glass
become wind chimes

almost time to leave
my son clings to me
like the cold spring rain

this butterfly
cannot be staring at me why do i stare back?

approaching the mountain
the airplane’s shadow
rises

pen in hand
i watch the river below
sign its name in rock

mockingbird sings
to the rhythm
of the freeway

sleepless night
the wind in the palms
is a passing train

unimpressed
with morning birdsong
high-tension wire

venice beach
body builders
can’t stop the rain

emerging
from the sand dunes
another jet

do these minnows know
the tidal pool
is receding?

trying to decipher
the hidden message
in the sea gull tracks

longest day
the sun
too lazy to set

ventura freeway
racing against
suburbia

night after night
her silhouette
practicing kata

summer night
the amber sky
still shimmering

still wondering
why that crow
is laughing at me

overheated car
ignored
by the rage of traffic

outdoor concert
the sweltering heat
of good salsa

tightly clutching
a dozen roses
from someone else

approaching thunder
the crows
are no longer laughing

now that the thunder
has subsided
i am unable to sleep

hot summer night
the lark and the nightingale
sing in harmony

fighting sleep
the endless hallway
growing steeper

armed with cold coffee
romeo takes aim
at the silent lark

more bitter than this coffee
the indigo sky

sunny day
i mimic
the mockingbird

perched on the balcony
i mimic
the mockingbird

found one roll
of photographs
i don’t remember

summer dawn
rival squirrels
assault my alarm clock

overcast night
the only stars
are fireflies

today’s wake-up call
another cat fight

drowning out
the window fan
locust song

two wine glasses
one empty - the other
overflowing

every night
i watch her silhouette
practice kata

summer snow
an invasion
of dandelion seeds

another night
in search of
exploding stars

my four year-old son
and a dandelion
riding the breeze

another hot night
i finally sleep
to the music of wine

my pet firefly
motionless in his jar
a starless sky

no end to this heat
the fireflies are drunk
on afternoon haze

leaning from the window
she bathes the midnight sky
with her golden hair

which of these two mirrors
beholds my true
wine-blushed face?

smothering the shadows
black sheets of rain

long-distance call
to my father
discussing the weather

approaching storm
shadows flee
beneath the trembling trees

cool summer night
the rise and fall
of satin sheets

my eyes open
was it your kiss
or the sparrow’s song?

unable to write
unwilling to drink
this cool white russian

my faithful dog
licks the wine
from my beard

wine and chocolate
without words you sense
my intoxication

dirty old river
must you keep rolling
through the night?

basking
in the glow
of doppler radar

long distance to my children
hearing only nickelodeon

purring bookends
my two cats

as crows
circle above
i check my watch

sitting by the window
the breeze shifts direction
from pizza to chow mein

on the fire escape
the breeze shifts direction
from pizza to chow mein

tompkins square
an old man teaches tai-chi
to the pigeons

the stranger
in the ambulance
my neighbor

hazy night
the full moon
is hot and tired

an old friend
knocking at my door
distant thunder

escaping the heat
i watch the snow
on my television

rainbow
stalked
by funnel clouds

sunny day
obscured by clouds
on the xray

passing the cemetery
i succumb to the urge
to buy flowers

at the flower shop
the irises, your eyes
in and out of focus

broken clouds
time to build
another dream

emerging from its nest
with a mighty roar
the construction crane

when i am in love
i am afraid
to count flower petals

no place to go this rainy morning
your warm soft body next to mine

military jet
carves a white scar
in the sky

the cold war lives
i curse
at a game of tetris

staring
at a sheet of paper a night without words

battery park
statue of liberty
in your eyes

college point
lawn chair audience
judging traffic

skyscraper
reflection
in courtyard puddle

incense of burning leaves
fills the pastel sky

distant subway train,
rescue me
from these shadows!

an old cop
who would rather not
wake up the drunk

even the cicadas
stop
for the fire truck

listening to the news
i feel guilty
for being alive

adult book store
a refuge
from church bells

reading
under the flashing neon light
one line at a time

after the storm
rainbows play
in street puddles

this bitter ale
the color of sunset

a part in the clouds
your smile
reflected in raindrops

on the escalator
socialites
ascending

busy squirrels
remind me
summer is almost gone

peeking through
the autumn haze
gold velvet moon

whitewashing
all but the brightest stars
full moon

far from my grasp
is this the summer’s
last butterfly?

my son waves goodbye
the window
streaming with rain

another starless night
drinking
the darkness

pouring the champagne
effervescent
ocean wave

my daughter’s toy phone
packed in my luggage again

the playground at dusk
children
replaced by shadows

sunset
reflected
in the laundromat window

my daughter’s birthday
i daydream
of bubblegum perfume

seeing its reflection
the sparrow narrowly avoids
my window

the fresh snow
robbing food
from the sparrow

after eating from my hand
this sparrow
can only go free

his first day of school
a rabbit hiding
in a field of clover

cool september night
the cry of the locust
my son’s sleepy smile

world trade center at dusk
a pair of sunsets

world trade center
a pair of sunsets

smiling in his sleep
my little cricket chaser

my two warring cats
snuggling in their sleep

from a high tension wire
a hawk watches me
cold colorless rain

breakfast at perkins
waves of gray hair
with nowhere to go

he laments
that he was more successful
in his past life

asleep at the end of the bar
another christ metaphor

inching closer
the bartender’s same speech
about the weather

overcast morning
the dew clinging
to golden leaves

spotting a familiar face
at the unclaimed baggage counter

a rude awakening
frost on my windshield

suburban terrorism
a blue jay stalks
the finch feeder

up past midnight
guiltily
watching cops

reading basho
between infomercials

standing in the rubble
exactly
where my room once was

this bitter ale
the taste of her lipstick

mixed in with the junk mail
my exwife’s therapy bills

awakened by lightning
without thunder
the blinking streetlamp

unable to sleep
i turn on the fan
to drown out the silence

empty page
annotated
with beer

galveston midnight
the bay reflects
the refineries’ glow

thank you
for the gift of yourself
unwrapped

its gentle lullaby
keeps me awake
autumn rain

first frost
dare i miss
the morning mosquitoes?

october rain
the silence
of the sparrows

minutes before
october arrives
i remember summer

watching annie hall
alone

seeing my reflection
as if expecting
someone else

still embracing
this old sweater
a strand of her hair

catching my glance
the waitress discards
some freshly dropped toast

content to wander
and yet so weary
cold autumn rain

first frost
time to take in
the plastic flamingo

frowning
at the jack o’lantern

pondering
the oj verdict
i think of my exwife

a dew drop clings
to an autumn leaf
your golden earrings

at sunrise
a harley races by
so fleeting

blur of passing cars
a pothole puddle
finds the lost shoe

smoke from a cigarette
the serpent
ascending

crowded coffee house
burning my tongue
i remember you

i curse this window
and another
parking lot breakup

the way he sips his espresso
it can’t be bitter enough

stood up by my date
i pour curdled milk
into my coffee

walking alone
i crave
the impending drizzle

after singing all day
the mockingbird
sounds even louder now

when i finally fall asleep
the rain pauses
to gaze at the moon

the night grandma died
i finally notice
my father’s accent

asleep on the train
the old woman
finally smiles

in their sunday best
a pack of children
savages their big macs

by my second cup of coffee
i wish i was still in bed

at 6’10 he gently bends
to let his mother
wipe his mouth

visiting grandma’s grave
i can almost smell
her arroz con pollo

the cricket’s song
penetrating
the moonless mist

warm october day
but the dragonflies know
that summer is over

my cat’s eyes
incinerate
the grasshopper

sunday hangover
no match
for my mother’s pancakes

in his sunday best
my son proudly displays
his new pet bullfrog

brittle brown leaves
can barely hold
the rain

lily lake
a merciful mirror
covered with leaves

cracked mirror
my daughter reads
my lonely haiku

renegade breeze
leaves return
to a well-raked lawn

waiting for the train
so many
gray tangled clouds

the billboard model
always staring
somewhere beyond me

three jazz pianists
improvising
for ghosts

tipping
the taxi driver
the last train pulls away

how brightly they shine
under the spotlights
water lilies

daydreaming
when i should be dreaming
gold crescent moon

the water tower
an urban fortress
guarded by pigeons

windless chicago day
still the shadows
bring a chill

resting my tired feet
still the need to wander

street musicians
lip-synching
a passing bus

unable to find my car
i give the beggar my change

at the foot of sears tower
a collarless dog
drinks from a puddle

november dusk
the buck returns awaiting
another dawn

whitewashing the stars
the full moon smiles
at two young lovers

columbus circle
a swirl of brittle leaves
homeless

sudden cold spell
the birdsong outside my window
stops

i am the monster
giving candy to children
with beer on his breath

in the country silence
i dream of trains

november morning
fox prints
in the fresh snow

waiting room coffee
more bitter than usual

november sun
a startled snowman
drops his pipe

such unexplored potential
the empty escalator

my autobiography
a crumpled lottery ticket

reluctant sun
not enough
to melt the snow

cold sunday morning
nothing i want
is in these want ads

more snow flurries
my hair grows grayer
before my eyes

crack of the bat
seconds later a sneakered foot
pushes aside the ivy

at happy hour
patrons and problems
line the bar

this dark ale
slowly overshadows
my pain

the disk jockey
taps his foot
slightly off the beat

snow changes to rain
i am unable to hold back
these tears

now all i can do
is remember
goodbye, my friend

unable to escape
the subway station
of my dreams

chased by a wild dog
i forget exactly why
i am running

looking not at all festive
christmas trees
on a flat-bed truck

summer moonlight
reflected in the sweat
of our bodies

a train passes
i remember
the taste of your lips

first snow flurry
how i long
to keep you warm

the end of summer
the locusts’ song
a season word

even indoors
this cold cold wind
makes me shiver

on this bitter cold day
the bright sun mocks

thanksgiving dinner
microwaved leftovers
shared with my cats

while you are gone
the evergreens are weeping
slow melting snow

freezing rain
the pavement
sparkles

while no one is watching
i build a snowman
with a stiff back

awake all night
my hallucinations dissolve
into coffee

early morning snow
an extra sugar
in my coffee

a fork in the road
unexpectedly, we diverge
i follow a path of tears

unraked leaves
the wind sighs
through bare tree limbs

silent snow
tonight
i drink alone

christmas shopping
my glazed eyes
reflecting neon

mouse droppings
at least i know
i am not alone

closing my eyes
my face in the mirror
still wrinkled

the fragrance
of your love letters
burning in the fire

a gentle finger
reveals
my still unread mail

beneath the frost
the rose
that will not die

late for dinner
i stare at the clouds
waiting for rain

sunday morning
the subway entrance
crowded with pigeons

clutching your flowers
i ignore the smiles
of strangers

waiting for the bus
wishing it would matter
if i were late

recognizing me
the beggar stuffs his hands
into his pockets

alone at the station
i engage in small talk
with another billboard queen

long nights at the bar
drinking cold ale
to stay warm

awake all night
frozen tree branches
dance on my ceiling

a baseball cap
floats in the puddle
wind-blown clouds

wrapped around each arpeggio
the guitarist’s cigarette smoke

wrigley field
pigeons in the bleachers
cheer the swirling snow

shivering
the full moon
beneath a veil of snow

just before sunrise
i search for shooting stars
in the indigo sky

this morning coffee
never warm enough
to melt the snow

xmas shopping
with one hand
always on my wallet

rockefeller center
skating
through rush hour traffic

happy hour over
my life’s story
interrupted

my favorite chair
far too comfortable
to be comfortable

manhattan snowfall
boots instead of sneakers
with business suits

blind man’s dog
looks into my eyes

december thaw
keeping the mittens
close by

peace in sarajevo
loading the wardrobe
onto the truck

christmas with my children
clutching broken toys

where we said goodbye
the water tower
now frozen

alone at the bar
her synthetic diamond
reflecting neon

happy hour over
the lonely drive home

after the ice storm
the fire escape
ignited by sunlight

smoke rises
from the storm sewer
and my coffee cup

purring softly
my cat is so in love
with my dinner

clumsy bumblebees
sing their drunken tune
clover is in bloom

bright city lights
i cannot see
the moon

punching a hole
through the soho night amber moon

stormy weather
on wall street
a blizzard of ticker tape

the sunset
from my office window
the long drive home

folding my pizza
olive oil presses
my wrinkled shirt

unfamiliar road
the hidden curves
under your blouse

waiting for the bus
i remember your shoulders
shivering

christmas eve
i hold the bus
for santa

staggering
toward the last bus
with exact change

lost in chinatown
with no roads
leading west

mcsorley’s old ale house
sharing a beer
with my memories

the decision
at canal and mulberry
pasta or tofu?

saying goodbye
to my children
gray winter rain

steam from a tea bag
another cold morning

frozen to my windshield
a parking ticket
the sudden chill

january wind
the streetlights
shiver

chimney smoke
fades into
the full moon

a cold drink
in january
the sound of ice cubes

sinuses draining
i tighten
the kitchen faucet

dressed for the storm
a mannequin stands vigil
over snowswept streets

till sunrise
two yellow traffic lights
through a curtain of rain

i love the taste
of your lips
speaking my name

ex-mother-in-law
preaching
to my outstretched phone

freezing rain
the trees
are broken glass

after the ice storm
even my car
glistens

stranded at o’hare
by a blizzard
somewhere else

after the storm
dueling snow plows

by coincidence
the pillow beside me
also wears your perfume

morning snow
the sound
of spinning tires

snow-covered pond
the memory
of your reflection

winter thunder
the flashing lights
of the subway

i hear the ocean
in the brittle branches
of the evergreens

field of snow
another unwritten haiku

hungry deer
watching me
watching them

unable to sleep
i count the cars
no longer there

in the hallway
the laces of our shoes
intertwined

awakened by thunder
my little one
flashes the lights

chapped lips
aching
or your kiss

one above zero
hastily removing
my scarf

church bells
punish
my sunday hangover

drinking alone
the pale moon
in a starless sky

goodwill bin
wedding band
priced for quick sale

5 p.m. the darkening shadow
on my face

winter thaw
my gloves
are not far away

ripples in the stream
my fingers
through your hair

at twilight
i can almost touch
your shadow

reading the personals
mocking
with pen in hand

prom night
my daughter winks
at her aging father

in a corner of the restaurant
a cat concentrates
on sleep

after the thaw
the soft white belly
of a dead squirrel

my old cotton robe
even softer
when she wears it

winter thaw
cat tails
bow to the sun

church bells
slightly
off-key

on the other side
of the crowded restaurant
the softness of your face

two weeks later
all that’s left
is a withered rose

freezing rain
the numbness
of bare trees

caught
by a low tree branch
the baseball cap

examining my watch
your smile

reading sartre
i realize
there is no exit

naked mannequin
by the frozen dumpster
a sudden shiver

pale purple sky
tonight
i drink alone

winter thaw
wading though the slush
my tears

awake all night
your angry words
in the wind

my fingers
clutching the air
where your hair once was

all day long
i sing the song
of the wind chimes

starless night
my son’s
long-distance tears

winter rain
in an empty parking lot
a pay phone rings

stepping over
the uss enterprise
to kiss my son goodnight

my sleeping daughter
wipes away
my good night kiss

biker bar
strangers compare tattoos

climbing down
the subway steps
melting snow

early thaw
another haiku
flows into the street

where we last kissed
mountains of snow
melting into sand

always dreaming
but never quite seeing
the cherry blossoms

suddenly
remembering my children
my blurred reflection

hermosa beach
ducks and surfers
ride the waves

sunday morning
street sweepers in rhythm
with the congas

boardwalk musician
completely equipped
with rollerblades

breakfast on the strand
a man and his surfboard

california night
feeling
the absence of trains

monday afternoon
perusing the want ads
between volleyball games

undisturbed by the sun
a ragged man
asleep on the beach

in the alleyway
broken glass
and well-fed cats

from his cage
a morning dove calls
into the night

mischievous wind
blowing dandelion seeds
on the neighbor’s lawn

morning sun
palm leaves
cling to dew drops

overcast sky
soaring over empty sands
the seagull’s cry

tuesday morning
pigeons search
for seeds in the sand

seagull
warily courting
the kite

closing my eyes
i rearrange the clouds
to spell your name

keeping rhythm
with the waves
unanswered pay phone

outside penn station
a blind beggar
counts his change

across the hallway
neighbors
resume our argument

empty ferris wheel
daydreams
of kissing lovers

minnesota spring
the geese return
to a frozen pond

windy night
while two lovers kiss
the streetlight winks

windless night
even in my dreams
the scent of jasmine

artist’s bedroom
four bare walls
and a mattress

home from work late again
another burned-out light bulb

late for the train
but more importantly
my morning bagel

you finally arrive
through my open window
jasmine dreams

white blossoms
on these black branches
summer leaves

stepping from the shower
a freshly drawn heart
on the mirror

in the shower
your perfume
slowly disappears

stillwater morning
jasmine blossoms
covered with frost

behind every
rain-soaked window
my four year-old son’s face

my taxes are paid
now it can snow again

april sunlight
glitters in my hair
the color of clouds

afternoon sunlight
the brightness
of this blank page

these words
lost
in an april sky

approaching storm
the thunder
of frightened geese

running after my dog
i am no longer young

also waiting
for the train
a hungry pigeon

urban cemetery
an old man
straightens a tombstone

darker than guinness
your intoxicating eyes

silent street
beyond every corner
a nightmare

missing my bus
the baby sleeps
in her mother’s arms

frog
pond
- splash!

also waiting
for the last train
a hungry pigeon

on the answering machine
my children sing
happy birthday

through the blinds
slivers
of full moon

somewhere
beyond this rain
the moon

city lights
softening
the moon

downtown breeze
stepping over
yesterday’s news

halfway across the world
missing you
and the moon

spring rain
awakens
the jasmine petals

distant thunder
the deepening darkness
of your eyes

leaving work late again
my car in the parking lot
alone

casting a shadow
across my kitchen table
a stack of bills

the long drive home
fields of jasmine
in my dreams

crushed rose petals
the letter
i never sent

weeks after easter
the empty basket

slowly spinning
on the windless lake
an empty boat

moments before dawn
i finally sleep
to the music of rain

summer evening
an old dog chases hubcaps
in his sleep

sudden downpour
washing you away
from my dream

warm spring day
children building castles
with road salt

minnesota-bound
the smell of fresh pizza
twelve hundred miles away

the overcast sky
a mirror
of this blank page

handshake or embrace?
circling above the clouds
awaiting clearance

another all-nighter
the caffeine-enhanced glow
of sunrise

sipping my tea
the tired hum
of a disk drive

cool summer night
silent crickets

glittering
with morning dew
deadly nightshade

leaning forward
but not quite reaching
the daddy long legs

twelve hundred miles away
my son’s baseball game

just outside
my bachelor pad
abandoned bird nest

hours before finals
i wake up
on page one

finally relaxed
i dream
of the next hectic day

lunar eclipse
long shadows
reappear

cool summer night
even the locusts
are sleeping

a toast
if not for this beer
i’d be alone tonight

moonless night
the deepening darkness
of your eyes

its thorns
rip my fingers
the perfect white rose

minnesota sunshine
diamonds
in street puddles

lightning
in the pale sunshine
your long, long hair

decorating
the winter garden
your long dark hair

clean-shaven
and ready for another day
of pan-handling

ignoring the rain
she holds her roses high

all that matters
is a gorgeous sunset
and this blank page

even the pigeons
seem to know
the last bus is gone

somewhere
beyond these skyscrapers
a pale yellow sun

between hiccups i reply
no, i don’t drink too much

6th and wabasha
waiting with ghosts
for a taxicab

grep-ing
for the last time
you said i love you

staring at the ceiling
nightingales become larks

july afternoon
sharing a lemon
with the sun

loring park
the pusher
plays saxophone

unmistakable
your long hair
in the dancing crowd

home after a rough day
even my cats stay away

just when i needed
to wish on a star
overcast night

my seven year-old
finally beats up the bully
in red crayon

my memory of her kiss
lost in thunderclouds

on lowry hill
sunday brunch
and salsa

10th and hennepin
basking
in the billboard shade

abandoned warehouse
shift change
at the pigeon nest

between fence posts
dandelion seeds
make their escape

the cruel flirts!
once again too late
for morning glories

weeping willow
slow dancing
in the wind

cold and overcast
wishing
it would finally rain

darkening sky
a stack of unpaid bills
still casts a shadow

minnetonka
indistinguishable
from the gray sky

low on gas
still tasting
that bitter ale

watching the hailstorm
i order my drink
without ice

lonely night
waiting for your phone call
and my pizza

still clinging
a lone dandelion seed

lingering
in my apartment
distant barbecue

hot summer day
my sweat
tastes like beer

waves crash on the beach
my grandmother’s wrinkles
in the sand

my half-empty bed
still giving you
plenty of space

windless night
my sweating pillow
collapses

lost in a strange town
the smiles of my children

brittle and dry
lilacs
from your garden

between
slices of toast
a kiss on the cheek

sand between my toes
dissolving before my eyes
the sound of waves

holiday feast
serving you
i’d much rather dine with you

fighting for the phone
my children wish me
happy father’s day

taking refuge
from the storm
in a scottish ale

reflected
in quiet puddles
darkening clouds

illuminating
my empty bed
distant thunder

hiding
in the unmowed grass
undercover cows

recently divorced
still reaching
for the ring

spanish mackerel
leaping out of the water
your warm summer smile

at the flea market
a gold wedding band
priced for quick sale

the longest day
waiting for my flight
i watch the sunset

leaving minneapolis
a bold and lonely sunset

at 30,000 feet
the soft and supple curves
of the horizon

final approach
the silent rush
of suburban streetlights

sudden cloudburst
the street puddles
join hands

dancing
with the ceiling fan
a cardboard star

your angry words relentless
thunder

waiting for the moving van
i see only clouds

leaving minnesota
in my rear-view mirror
a shooting star

cambridge brewpub
mit dropouts
engineer hangovers

memorial drive
rollerblading
into pigeons

off-night at the pub
the barmaid
beautifully bored

another birthday
another six pack
shared with my cats

memories of the beach
pouring
from my sneaker

the pavement and i
smoldering
in airport traffic

rush hour
clutching the wheel
and my first cup of coffee

thunder and lightning
suddenly the silence
of the computer

mid crossword
a red dress flutters
in the corner of my eye

another long night
dreaming of dark ale
and rain

new england fog
the memory
of your face

fluffing my pillow
i reach to pet the cat
who isn’t there

fresh out of salsa
the mexican cook kisses
his fair-haired girlfriend

mid crossword
fluttering past my eye
your red dress

autumn night
drinking
the absence of rain

autumn night
not nearly enough
stars to count

shooting star
the taste
of our first kiss

my five year-old
watches the moon
with a dirty face

first frost
an empty spider web

disappointing me
right on time
another blind date

holding hands
with the girl of my dreams
the bartender

uncoiling
at the end of your cigarette
your lips

strutting on the subway platform
the pigeon
and the prostitute

awakened
by the silence
of the telephone

distant thunder
suddenly a cloud
of sparrows

the sweet smell
of your love letters
burning in the fire

october sunset
the deepening amber
of this ale

city breeze
yesterday’s headline
crosses the street

my brother’s wedding day
fast-moving clouds
surround the sun

scattering
as my lips draw near
dandelion seeds

first snowfall
bare branches and commuters
tremble at the station

celebrating the new job
with a bitter ale

bound with wire
to a flatbed truck
christmas trees

porter square serenade
between trains

outside the bank
a man asks
spare change?

on the front lawn
my son’s baseball glove
clutches a snowball

in a back room
broken toy soldiers
marked return

on the way to work
the december sun
finally rises

alone at alewife station
the tired moan
of the last train

writing this poem
on the 621 train
the conductor sleeps

the street musician
stops playing
my favorite song

the fenway crowd
applauds a diving catch
in the bleachers

new year’s eve
the bitter taste
of cheap champagne

crying
all night long
the wind

new year’s day
the snow thaws
unnoticed

each time the train stops
a mother resumes
her lullaby

clinging to your kiss
the moving van
is right on time

reading the globe
he turns each page
before i finish

the ultimate independence
eating ramen from the pot

alone at the supermarket
checking out
the check-out girl

full of beer
i stare
at your empty chair

smiling at me
the whole way home
my son’s teddy bear

tonight’s traffic
slower than
our last dance

shivering
i patiently sip
a winter warmer

alone at the bar
a deep blue woman
i will never meet

your angry words
wind rattling the shutters
all night long

thinking of you
i step ankle deep
into a slush puddle

you ask me
what i’m thinking
snow changes to rain

weaving between
empty wine bottles
christmas garland

rushing to work
i take the time
to kick a pebble

the kiss goodbye
from the corner of my eye
i can see you counting stars

washing down
your angry words
with this bitter ale

along the charles
a pair of ducks
swims past the bus

unwilling
to do more than gaze
at the winter rain

waiting for the train
i clutch
my ice cold coffee

waiting for the train
a flock of pigeons
and me

waiting for the train
the street musician
sings out of tune

a steady snowfall
reading and re-reading
my daughter’s letter

morning after
the super bowl
a colorless sky

leaving suburbia
sunlight clings
to evergreens

another cold morning
with no idea
where i left my hat

yes i know i’ll never find her
at the bottom of this beer

the long ride home
i mourn the loss
of my favorite billboard

tree branches snap
in the cold wind
i clutch my back

noticing
the naked mannequin
i shiver

preparing to move
only my beer
remains unpacked

unlike their author
her love letters follow me
to my new home

carrying an umbrella
knowing it will never rain

watching jackie chan
i kick at my shadow
and miss

with no one to call
i find another dime

awaiting the verdict
my eyes are riveted
to commercials

talking to herself
the old woman’s eyes
never leave me

no place to go
no desire
to come in from the rain

the morning after
valentine’s day roses
in the trash

the morning after
valentine’s day roses
at half price

alone again
the numbness
of a winter walk

beyond every daydream horizon
the new york city skyline

hermosa morning
mothers in rollerblades
pushing strollers

asleep on the beach
a man and his surfboard

manhattan beach
closing my eyes
the waves become the subway

a california souvenir
i can afford
my sunburnt nose

rain mixed with snow
remembering
my daughter’s tears

torn and wrinkled
the photograph of a face
that used to be mine

st. patrick’s day
a sea of green clothing
and red noses

the first day of spring
on the platform she shivers
in her mini-skirt

first day of spring
under the melting snow
my unopened letter

brightening the evening sky
the memory of your smile

april rain
clinging to my face
a smile

april wind
dogwood blossoms
at my feet

first warm day of spring
wild flowers blossom
in my daydreams

under two feet of snow
our footprints

the big thaw
my car roof peaks
over a snowdrift

the thaw continues
black fishnet stockings
and heavy boots

repairing the fishing nets
her hair gently unfurls

stood up again
i close my eyes
to the comet

the thaw continues
road salt
and spiked heels

melting snow
our words

warm april day
the lazy cotton
of her peasant blouse

boston sunset
the deepening amber
of a bitter ale

reflected
in your dark brown eyes
another shooting star

midnight the rise and fall
of flannel sheets

all night long
the silence
of clouds

april afternoon
the snow disappears
into jazz

outdoor cafe
now serving
a late april frost

davis square serenade
to dirty gray pigeons

behind the sheer curtain
her silhouette
brushes her hair

soft pink
cherry blossoms
against my lips

sleeping on my doorstep
the black and white cat
who isn’t a cat

will the flowers
in my bachelor pad
ever bloom?

spiked heels
stab
the april snow

wishing my son
happy birthday
on the answering machine

savoring the taste
of the rain
on your face

all of my words
lost
in this rain

waiting for the bus
her miniskirt
and me

the somerville skyline
partially obscured
by stacks of unpaid bills

trapped
inside my pen
this haiku

moving day
the letter
i thought i’d sent

sandpiper
and the cold ocean
playing hard-to-get

on the express train
a baby sleeps
uninterrupted

stranger than fiction
she thanks me for flowers
i didn’t send

mother’s day
in search of the last rose
at k-mart

quick monday lunch
an extra paisley
on my tie

the last day of april
finally i put away
the snow shovel

missing the comet
i slowly recede
beyond the horizon

between t stops
i read
your eyes

morning mist rises
from my third cup
of coffee

urban rainbow
swirling
in a puddle

on-line again
writing these words
about the beautiful day

pushing his cart
the old man shops
for empty cans

piercing
the perfect lips
a shining diamond

rushing to the limo
in her prom dress
a torn corsage

around every corner
the memory of your face

waxing eloquent
your long legs

above the clouds
i ignore my watch
and go to sleep

rushing away
from the oncoming train
commuter pigeons

on the perfect beach day
i stay home
surfing the web

in the eaves
of the homeless shelter
pigeons build a nest

no longer
strawberry bubblegum
my daughter’s perfume

lost
one lonely bachelor
without his cats

at downtown crossing
the weekend exchange
of their son

circling
then crossing out
an exgirlfriend’s personal ad

leaving the candy machine
having achieved
almond joy

circling
then crossing out
a girlfriend’s personal ad

midnight
looking up from the trash
two tiny full moons

eggs juxtapositioned
with veggies out of season
a western omelet

sharing another breakfast
with snap, crackle and pop

reflected
in my daughter’s eyes
her father’s tears

traversing the strings
of my guitar
a spider

enjoying
a midnight swim
the moon and i

the game postponed
ducks encircle
second base

eight years shy of 45
gray hairs
outnumber the black

just outside my window
the world’s loudest bird

squeezing from my pillow
the fading fragrance
of your hair

davis square garden
commuters hurry past
swarming bees

an evening with
the bachelor poet
beer and haiku

first date
under the streetlight
our shadows hold hands

her hair billows
in the breeze
of a passing bus

roses bow
before the passing train

midnight
caressing
the wind chimes

for one more night
we ignore each other
the cactus and i

clothed in purple
- sunset

high noon
a one-legged egret
hops into the shade

shifting from east to west
the sound of construction

july afternoon
the smell of lightning

approaching storm
a cloud
of seagulls

thrift store countertop
several engagement rings
only slightly used

beneath my eyelids
i see your warm body
next to mine

quarter moon
straining
to see your eyes

at the fabric store
picking out a dye
for that wedding dress

watching casablanca
i grip your hand
tightly

waiting for the bus
forsythia blossoms
fall

caressing your fingertips
these fragile blossoms

toes gripping the carpet
i surf the web

july overcast
i have forgotten
my umbrella

morning haze
dissolves
under your fingertips

savoring
the beautiful weather
on this postcard

late july night
a blues guitar
sweltering

lazy july morning
the steam from my coffee
has no place to go

lingering for a kiss
the train leaves
right on time

walking to your house
a procession
of wild flowers

summer drizzle
a cat sleeps
undisturbed

downtown crossing
a rusty subway car
sings the blues

waiting for the bus
yesterday’s headline
and me

first raindrops
the fragrance
of hot cement

new orleans funeral
the wailing clarinet

harvard square panhandler
lets me pass by

forgetting the day
at the bottom of this pint

automatic door opens
for a pair of pigeons

across the bar from me
a blind date
stumbles

back bay station
the prostitute
dressed in white

midsummer moon
my teenaged daughter
asks me about sex

rockin’ at 38
too close to the mosh pit
too far from the stage

a rocker’s dilemma
to flee or to catch
the crowd surfers?

asleep on the train
clutching
the invisible you

august morning
making love to you
to the music of rain

approaching storm
a tree filled with blackbirds
silent

last-minute lunch
the atm
eats my card

hot summer morning
this time the conductor
lets me catch the train

my 38th birthday
the tired aching moan
of the train

cool august morning
snuggling
in air conditioning

a beer
before my doctor’s appointment
the lingering taste of pain

bathroom graffiti
one heart two names
crossed out

deeply dark
with amber overtones
this ale - your eyes

approaching storm
i rush home
to update my resume

thickening clouds
a steady downpour
of beer

waiting for the train
every day
my shadow lengthens

crowded brewpub
unable to hear
these words

crowding onto my answering machine
headhunters and bill collectors

waiting for the interview
i count raindrops

outside davis square
a street musician is arrested
for playing the blues

approaching harvard square
i ignore the stranger
who wants to make friends

with callused hands
a homeless man
keeps his pants up

another job interview
smiling politely while
my name is mispronounced

a break in the clouds
the commuter rail
enters the suburbs

above the treetops
a vulture
almost motionless

en route to the interview
a street performer
without an audience

straightening my tie
i step over the man
asleep on the sidewalk

the last night of summer
even the cat can’t sleep

the first day of fall
filling my lungs
with the fragrance of coffee

as i wake up
the soothing rumble
of a cat purring

october
coming home early
to my dark apartment

early for the interview
i watch the escalator
ascending

on the early train
a student reads her textbook
with both eyes closed

my weary feet
reflected
in spilled beer

morning mist
still tasting
last night’s beer

october afternoon
carrying a winter jacket
in the warm sunshine

october afternoon
carrying home
my winter jacket

asleep on the train
my wrist watch
still keeps perfect time

october 15th
at five o’clock
i race the darkness home

autumn breeze
i can wait one more day
to rake leaves

november night
the wind steals leaves
from the trees

missing the early train
i wonder if you are also
watching the sunset

each brown ale
reminds me more of the color
of my children’s eyes

the view from my window
miles of empty sky

frayed but neatly printed
his sign reads
i am homeless  please help

between the dumpster
and the construction crane
a sidewalk blues jam

on the road
i savor
your email

veteran’s day
a tiny paper flag
pinned to the beggar’s lapel

veteran’s day
a tiny paper flag
pinned to shabby fatigues

tearing the sheets from the bed
in search of
a strand of your hair

in the waiting room
a goldfish
watches me

december in boston
the chill
of the skyscraper wind

from inside the train
the police sirens
are silent

still clinging
december leaves

the waitress
now serving
spaghetti straps

cold december night
taking refuge
in a blues guitar

empty beer pitcher
carelessly tossed
on her empty side of the bed

the bottle
spins
me

decorating the tree
the hands i wish
were holding me now

first snow
halfway to the mailbox
in bare feet

far from my children
christmas rain

new year’s day
a graveyard
of christmas trees

winter moonlight
the shadows seem
so long tonight

another late night
searching for you
through the turnpike mist

caressing her thighs
the sweater she knits
for somebody else

guarding the bird feeder
a pair of fat squirrels

an old dog
enduring the pokes
of a little boy

long island sound
the silence
of two ships passing

securing the last boat
a solitary gull
flies away

sitting in the sun
an old dog
sleeps in my shade

sipping a beer
the iguana
doesn’t move

dockside bar
playing with my ice cubes
i remember boston

placencia beach
a rooster crows
in the cool of night

unlike me
tonight’s mosquitoes
have no desire to sleep

sleepless night
whispering
among mosquitoes

there  another haiku
is it time for a beer?

held just right
the sea wind whistles in the mouth
of an empty beer bottle

so busy
this hot afternoon
the hummingbird

emerging
from the caribbean
a blood red moon

yes, there is a heaven
placencia moonlight
in your eyes

asleep on the train
my dreams of balmy beaches
end at south station

shopping for the ring
my car’s brakes
are squealing

winter sun
the office administrator
in a miniskirt

winter sun
make mine
a double espresso

winter sun
and i still want
to sleep on the train

outside starbuck’s
the rush hour crowd
of pigeons

all alone
in the texas sky
crescent moon

outside the alamo
an old chicano
begs for change

hot morning sun
she is watching me
not look at her legs

correcting the taxi driver
in a strange town
a sky filled with clouds

dollar pint night
a queasy mixture
of trip-hop and soul

restless night
streetlight reflected
in the cat’s eyes

awakened by the bartender
the taxi driver
quickly settles his bill

placencia morning
waiting for the hummingbird
we quietly make love

en route to miami
she sleepily calls me
by another name

brooklyn
from 30,000 feet
almost beautiful

south station monday
sipping my morning coffee
i smell only flowers

st. patrick’s day
washing down my ramen
with a pint of guinness

st. patrick’s day
suburban lawns
still brownish gray

spring in the air
approaching wellesley hills
she lets her hair down

spring in the air
caught in the web
of her fishnet stockings

rush hour traffic
wading through walls
of second-hand smoke

winter fog
the rise and fall
of the ventilator

watching the respirator
the stillness
between breaths

empty subway station
the smell of rain

first day of spring
shivering in my shirt sleeves
at the train station

first day of spring
her white silk stockings
and winter coat

spring snow
melting
into tulip blossoms

spring snow
she crosses the street
in short skirt and boots

a warm day in march
snow and clothing
melt away

the junkyard at night
a hubcap filled
with rainwater and stars

overcast day
the ventilator
silent

downtown boston
a noisy flock
of construction cranes

speaking with my exwife
i break open a peanut
and eat the shell

working late again
the dinner i missed
simmering

working late again
the amber twilight
fades to black

our wedding day
a perfect bouquet
of wild flowers

april morning
not yet tired
of dandelions

afternoon rain
suddenly i remember
where i left my umbrella

income tax day
unable to kill
the hungry mosquito

september wedding
the sweltering heat
of a blues guitar

downtown boston
skyscrapers ascending
into fog

if i could put it
in a vase for you
this purple sunset

april sunset
my daughter’s
long-distance tears

overcast sky
still feeling
last night’s beer

taking the late train
a sky filled
with rambling clouds

circles
from my beer mug
frame this haiku

decorating
the bare white window frame
a ladybug

our wedding day
one dozen purple roses
and hot jambalaya

our wedding day
searching the shadows
for my daughter’s smile

a seagull cries
why am i going to work
on a beautiful day?

my daughter’s birthday
my hair is slightly grayer
than it was yesterday

monday morning
from inside the train
i hear locusts

hooters - 9 a.m.
waiting at the kitchen door
a dozen pigeons

after the rain
my old beat-up van
covered with lilacs

washing the dishes
a housefly
caught in the curtains

blue moon cafe
counting the stars
on the ceiling

in this notebook
scribbles, cross-outs
and the smell of beer

rushing to work
no time
to kill a fly

sunshine returns
i can’t remember
where i last left my shades

how perfectly
it clings
her black suede skirt

the clean-swept
city streets
of seinfeld

she searches
for mr. right
through a golden ale

sitting alone
she clutches a cell phone
and a warm beer

spring breeze
the refreshing sensation
of her thighs

holiday approaching
i ride into work
with my shades on

decorated
with stickers and prayers
my daughter’s renga link

scrutinizing
my new haircut
a noisy blackbird

the dow drops
but mother spider
keeps spinning her web

the still pond
tossing a stone
i shatter the moon

already hot this morning
i am trying not to talk
to her cleavage

sleepless night
lightning reflected
in the cat’s eyes

silencing the crows
morning thunder

after the storm
raindrops cling
to spider webs

harvard square
the street musician’s
shiny new guitar

this dark ale
the color
of my daughter’s eyes

monday morning
traffic jam
slow steady rain

monday morning
dissolving
into coffee

upside down
her reflection
staring at the moon

swirling
with each oar stroke
the moon’s reflection

a lonely night
do my children see
this same blurred moon?

allston train yard
dandelions encircle
the old caboose

kenmore square
impromptu waterfall
down the subway steps

summer mist
the softness
of her skin

the dow recovers
but no one gives her
spare change

after the storm
native bostonians
still carry their umbrellas

boston fog
the gentle glow
of the citgo sign

three beers later
the music turns
to purple haze

father’s day
a hurried email
from my daughter

late summer night
the amber haze
of too much beer

punishing
my sunday hangover
church bells

morning breeze
last night’s rain
falls from the trees

all night long
the invisible sound
of the subway

chasing a mosquito
i stub my toe

dark, soft
and so effervescent
this freshly poured guinness

full of energy
on this hot summer night
a mosquito

thursday morning hangover
in the distance
a blues guitar

taking the late train
tourists admire
my coffee-stained shirt

midtown cemetery
the pigeons
perfectly still

630 a.m.
the cat is already hunting
for shade

east village brewpub
huevos rancheros
and a hefe-weizen

in the heat of day
the spider’s web
is empty

south bay afternoon
hot sun, cold beer
and a longing for home

redondo beach
spf 30
and gold toenail polish

hermosa beach
two women on rollerblades
pushing baby strollers

low tide
at hermosa beach pier
another crack deal

manhattan beach
perusing the want ads
between volleyball games

her bright blue bikini
matching her lips
the drowning victim

hanging limply
from a piece of driftwood
the american flag

exactly not
in rhythm with the waves
the wind chimes

calling my son on his birthday
the phone rings unanswered

high above times square
tourists photograph
the falling scaffolding

before the rain
the absence
of mourning doves

taking the ferry
from port jeff station
to the perfect sunset

interrupting
my empty stare
the hiss of bus brakes

broken streetlight
lightning
without thunder

after the storm
rainbows
in street puddles

via email
birthday wishes
from my daughter

boston fog
i can feel
the boom box

new england morning
the sound
of fog

the last train home
the promise of cold dinner
and the smell of beer

restless night
reaching for the pager
in my sleep

late to work
my coffee mug
right where i left it

pleasant summer night
i spare
the spider web

that final beer
my eyes already
at half-mast

the old oak tree
my initials
twenty feet high

as the market tumbles
i throw a penny
into the fountain

wall street reels
but there are plenty of acorns
in my backyard

dew
clinging
to september

our wedding day
the joyful wail
of a blues guitar

autumn in cambridge
the punker’s green hair
dyed orange

combing my hair
on a cool autumn day
early frost

busy intersection
reflected in her eyes
the blinking red light

bulk mail
from a congressman
i didn’t elect

laundry day
sorting
unmatched socks

warm autumn morning
the mist
unrefreshing

east of 128
my coffee
grows cold

her sad eyes
watch my smile
disappear

mr. dooley’s tavern
red-faced stock brokers
liquidated

ignoring
the don’t walk sign
her miniskirt

firmly planted
in the greenhouse
a pink flamingo

etched in chalk
join the fencing team
no experience needed

rosemary blossoms
whose footprints
are on the greenhouse roof?

ginko walk
stealing a haiku moment
and a kiss

dining al fresco
the juxtaposition
of blues and protest music

interrupting
my haiku meditation
to kill a yellow jacket

waiting patiently
outside the kitchen door
a three-legged dog

october morning
the disappearing cloud
of my breath

reassuringly
locating
the distress bag

one hour before landing
the fragrance
of instant coffee

watching her smile
when she says
it’s our honeymoon

austin morning
making love
to the music of rain

alone in texas
the cold spot
on her side of the bed

austin brewpub
a patron orders
a cold sweaty blonde

texas heat
the glistening legs
of the barmaid

unable to sleep
infomercials
in the hotel lounge

unable to sleep
i almost listen
to the lounge piano

in a dallas suburb
a midnight stroll
with lawn sprinklers

this corona
the color of sunrise

october rain
she fine tunes her lipstick
on the worcester express

rush hour traffic
my second cup of coffee
is cold

passing the freightyard
a procession
of low-lying clouds

asleep on the train
another pale gray sky

entering south station
sunlight glistens
on construction cranes

waiting for the train
time and shadows
slip away

long and dark
autumn shadows
and her legs

putting away
the lawn furniture
warm october day

monday morning
only the jack o’lanterns
are smiling

a homeless man sleeps
on sunday’s obituaries

october morning
the alarm clock
is increasingly darker

october morning
the sun is much too bright
without coffee

sleepless night
the silence
of the mass pike

smoke spirals
from burning leaves
and it’s only thursday

crowded elevator
a fatal clash
of perfumes

turning back the clock
what to do
with that extra hour?

october night
not a cloud in the sky
except my breath

after the debate
i vote
for another beer

passing the freight yard
an unhitched engine
covered with leaves

she seems
so flat and pale
in newsprint

now arriving
at south station
a cold november wind

no seat on the train
i watch the bare trees
shiver

wall street rallies
reads the headline
in the trash

mass pike traffic
driving into sunrise

leaping
between skyscrapers
the moon

above the sleeping
construction cranes
a full moon

piercing the diesel hum
the conductor’s whistle

the long walk
from the train station
to your embrace

veteran’s day rain
an old man holds an umbrella
above the monument

silent steps
through darkness
unraked leaves

where we once walked
an overgrown path

stopping traffic
her tight black miniskirt

first frost
and still no desire
to rake the leaves

thanksgiving weekend
she updates her shopping list
between t stops

downtown crossing
pigeons peck
the fallen tinsel

our first christmas
snow angels
holding hands

thanksgiving leftovers
words
i never should have said

south station
clutching a hot cappuccino
the homeless man sleeps

between south station
and a construction crane
sunrise

full moon
the midnight sheen
of her stockings

warm december night
pub windows decorated
with spraycan snow

the newlywed
even on business trips
he puts the seat down

dinner with an old friend
a welcome respite
from the cold

in a faceless suburb
i see you
everywhere

where i last saw your face
a cold lakefront wind

acid jazz saxophone
also incoherent
after three beers

even after three beers
the jukebox
won’t play my song

her hardened features
no softer
after three beers

december night
bare feet
on bathroom tile

home sick in bed
the cat
still wants to be fed

bombs fall in baghdad
and here i am hoping
it doesn’t snow

one week before christmas
the frozen stares
of last-minute shoppers

the monday before christmas
i watch my coffee grow cold

shortest day
dinner candles
drowning in wax

gray squirrels
stalk the bird feeder
my son is thirteen

south station
a string quartet
serenades the christmas tree

between christmas and new year’s
the fireplace glows
with gift wrap

disposing of a dead mouse
the basement door
unexpectedly locks

black ice
even with the heat on
i shiver

perilously close
to the third rail
a runaway snowflake

january
my shoes
the color of road salt

a dusting of snow
my last beer remains
unopened

mid-winter chill
her long and slender legs
are wearing pants

a dusting of snow
your footprints
and mine

sleepless night
snow turns to sleet
and back again

overnight flurries
the ominous glow
of sunrise

our old house
a different kind
of cold draft

freezing rain
the tree branches break
so beautifully

at the bookstore
a frugal shopper
reading haiku

turkey leftovers
the wishbone
is already broken

last call
which drunken businessman
will take her home tonight?

after ten years he says
he can no longer feel
the ring

missing the last train
the lingering diesel fumes
burn

in the trainyard
snow still covers
the old caboose

late night install
the empty coffee pot
still burning

gentleman’s club
the senate hearings
under strobe lights

january in dallas
a continuum of gray

overcast night
shouting directions
at the taxi driver

dollar beer wednesday
wave after wave
of liquid noise

alone again
this dark ale
and me

at the end of the bar
a cemetery
of bad pick-up lines

closing time
three beers later
the cold rain

her long blonde hair
is darker at the roots
than mine once was

inconsiderate commuter
the man on the platform
is taking too long to die

ground hog’s day
skyscraper shadows
melt into rain

winter rain
forgetting
my mother’s birthday

february sun
shimmering
on frozen puddles

copley square a conflagration
of frozen sidewalks

smiling
between suitcases
a cabbage patch doll

nothing personal, little frog
but i prefer to shower alone

pointing its long white finger
at the sea
a funnel cloud

one year later
the bartender pretends
to recognize me

hot night
neither side of the pillow
seems cool

thanks to the neighbors’ door slams
i catch the sunrise

all of these birds
pretending to know nothing
about last night’s rain

after the rain
the silence
of clouds

our last full day
finishing another stout
i try to drink it all in

checking our baggage
we can finally gloat
at the pale-skinned tourists

my first day back
beach sand from my shoes
mixes with frost

february cold snap
halfway to south station
my coffee is gone

ashes on forehead
she lights another cigarette

winter rush hour
brake lights bleed
through clouds of exhaust

surfing the web
for snow advisories

twilight
the cold medicine changes
from dayquil to nyquil

entering south station
the construction cranes don’t care
that it’s snowing

winter night
the hum
of the humidifier

moonless night
a lone seagull
with nowhere to go

between solos
the trumpet player wipes the spittle
from his mouthpiece

caressing her face
while she sleeps on the green line
skyscraper shadows

over and over again
she mouths i love you
headphones buzzing

ignoring
rush hour traffic
the sun

punk night club
by the fourth set
his mohawk is exhausted

six months later
this old guitar
is still in tune

snow changes to rain
too many weeks
between visits with my children

stung
by a stiff march breeze
i remember you

the old church
wears a sign
now leasing

pay day narrowly missing
another storm

sleep in your eyes
i daydream you
into my bed

standing on the platform
a crowd
of running noses

mid-march blizzard
a snow plow
mired in mud

spring thaw
loosening the top button
of her blouse

st. patrick’s day
a bicycle courier
with his dreadlocks dyed green

march thaw
sweat drips
from my beer mug

sake on an empty stomach
- a haiku headache

march rain
a puddle encircles
the brownish gray snow

first day of spring
pressing against a tight sweater
her erect nipples

late afternoon
following a shaft of sunlight
between skyscrapers

spring cleaning
an exgirlfriend’s letters
in the recycle bin

my daughters’ plane departs
a plume of white smoke
lingers

playing catch with my sons
not a cloud in the sky

overcast morning
she skips past
today’s horoscope

morning walk
your words
in the wind

asked about his grades
my son drops the ball

working late again
the ghosts in this elevator
wear cheap cologne

income tax day
the season’s first spider web
and its victim

five minutes to eight
all eyes
on the invisible train

lighting a cigarette
the burn victim

gourmet coffee shop
how patiently
the homeless man waits

now that she’s gone
this tiny hotel room
is suddenly much larger

a break in the drizzle
and then i remember
your voice

hurdling over a pothole
city jogger

sidewalk dance
still reluctant
to kiss in public

just when i thought
it would never stop raining
she smiles at me

watching me drink
the bartender
paces

if she smiles at me
one more time
i’ll just sit here ^

breakfast with a friend
smiling
in the cold rain

indefinite delay
the unexpected parting
of your lips

running a red light
so that i can wait
in the last parking space

sweet sixteen
my daughter still smiles
in her sleep

a visit from my children
canceled
cold spring rain

elbows on the bar
does he think i look as drunk
as i think he does?

waiting for the train
a swirl of dogwood petals

noticing my stare
she hides
her victoria’s secret bag

the old house
ivy vines encircle
a rusted swing set

too busy
to greet one another
the rabbit and i

sleepless night
the whistling nose
of the cat

taking an earlier train
the fogged-up windows
of a donut shop

approaching train
a rat
abandons its breakfast

reading today’s headline
i stifle a yawn

fresh spraypaint
on the supermarket dumpster
jesus saves

casual day
the softness
of her faded jeans

suburban new england
the white vinyl siding
of an old wooden church

horseshoe dilemma
to toss a perfect ringer
without spilling my beer

firmly planted
in the garden
a pair of pink flamingos

memorial day
awakened
by the passing parade

spring morning
invisible fog
of lilac blossoms

just when i needed
to wish on a star
overcast night

navy pier
the classic merry-go-round
of your smile

closing time
the dance
of the streetlights

stepping from the train
can’t wait
to light that cigarette

reflecting the moonlight
her black vinyl skirt

colorado springs
facing the mountains
i catch my breath

flying over cleveland
the burnt plastic smell
of airplane food

after the rain
puddles filled
with wind-blown sky

late for the train
a dog sniffs
the empty benches

still wearing
yesterday’s makeup
her coffee grows cold

climbing the stairs
her tight black miniskirt
leaves me breathless

memorial day
one more year the flag
remains in the attic

turning forty
a long and glorious sunset

crossing her legs
she stirs her yogurt
with a plastic spoon

wrong turn
down a dead-end street
irises in bloom

first day of june
withering dandelions

back bay station
dressed to kill
she ignores the train

early for the train
rusty track disappears
into haze

new england summer
the sun shines bright
somewhere beyond this haze

how smooth
this home-brewed ale
on your skin

leaving nothing to the imagination
does victoria have a secret? ;^

temperature rising
the sundress gently slips
from her shoulder

summer tragedy
her long silky hair
tied up in a bun

the 1005 train
counting the weary miles
between you and me

on the pitcher’s mound
my ten year-old son
seems so small

summer morning
the lingering haze
of too much beer

another warm day
the lingering taste
of her lipstick

my favorite perfume
the wind
in her hair

right on schedule
she passes me by
- summer girl

our wedding day
the joyful wail
of a blues guitar

sleepless night
the persistent silence
of a memory leak

summer jog
her tight white tank top
makes me dizzy

christmas with my children
mending broken toys

lost in chinatown
a stray dog drinks
from a puddle

six weeks without rain
her dark eyes reflect
a cloudless sky

glittering
under the city lights
a broken beer bottle

hugging her
oh so close
faded jeans

ten after four
slowly passing a refrigerator
filled with beer

italian restaurant
now serving
spaghetti straps

downtown boston
two cups of coffee later
the summer haze lingers

approaching storm
she sees me glancing
at her legs

filled with smoke
her eyes

on the back
of a rejection letter
i write my next haiku

after the rain
even the construction cranes
sleep

city crosswalk
all eyes
on her miniskirt

high school reunion
unrecognized
i order another beer

small town tavern
all of these strangers
know my name

lining up
at the knotty pine bar
regulars and their children

third of july
in my favorite junkyard
i weep

seney stretch
between this blinking light and the next
nothing but miles

not a cure for pain
this beer nonetheless
dilutes my tears

morphine
how deep and hollow
the echo of your voice

overcast morning
i take my coffee
black

first date
between awkward pauses
he imagines her naked

waiting for the train
three russians argue politics
in broken english

nearing forty
i finally notice
the day lilies

the plough and stars
new friends and old memories
share a pint

brookline hills
standing tall and proud
an old woman and her cart

on the green line
a beautiful flower
in her hair

on a park bench
he rehearses
his breakup speech

brigham circle
a muslim woman
in veil and sneakers

the admitting desk
waiting for my name
to be mispronounced

copley station
the accordion plays
love potion #9

hot day at the beach
the smell of burning sausage

the heat wave continues
she no longer adjusts
her falling shoulder strap

after a long weekend
the train
seems especially loud

bright summer day
bending down for a ground ball
i see stars

running late for work
i watch my daughters sleep

a break in the heat
i leave a one dollar tip
for the coffee shop

waiting for surgery
the orderlies
pace

in the recovery room
one rubber glove reaching
from the box

while donating blood
the steady rhythm
of my clenching fist

the ferry horn sounds
waving goodbye
to my children

boston haze
the silence
of skyscrapers

taking the early train
mist rises
from my coffee

boston skyscraper
a beautiful view
of a rooftop sunbather

under the ceiling fan
our kisses melt
into lovemaking

clinging
to her sundress
the wind

on the dance floor
an exgirlfriend
with another loser

obstructing my view
her head
on his shoulder

on either side
of the mass pike
wild flowers

turning forty
my chevy van engine
keeps on running

magazine ad reads
find your soulmate
or your money back

turning forty
my thirteen year-old
is out of shaving cream

piano practice
slow
steady
rain

my son’s tears
as the ferry pulls away
summer twilight

awakened by thunder
she kisses me

my old workplace
the security guard sleeps
undisturbed

missing my children
these tired rusty
railroad tracks

the end of august
shiny new lunch boxes
lined up on the curb

last days of summer
train station shadows
grow taller

last days of summer
short skirts
long coats

first day of school
the battle
of baggy jeans

wednesday morning
another day to pass
the unfinished mural

bowl of popcorn ready
i watch
an exercise video

unrecognized
by an old friend
clouds without rain

the still pool
a frog jumps
into itself

moonless night
the barmaid
calls me honey

waiting for the train
the slow cascade
of a guinness

first day of school
the empty pages
of her notebook

summer’s last stand
waiting for the breeze
of a passing train

my daughter’s birthday
a mourning dove basks
in the september sun

south station treasure
the bottle at the bottom
of the trash can

through the snow
on my televison set
hurricane warnings

after the storm
the freshly poured pavement
of fallen leaves

beautifully
out of control
her hair

driving my children
to the ferry
a deep purple sunset

one more cold beer
and i’ll stop shivering

new england blues club
the businessman watches the blonde
go home with the biker

late morning dew
a hug
from my oldest son

a pair of socks
my daughter left behind
september fog

all alone
in the thickening overcast
harvest moon

another late night
i watch as the taxi driver
passes my street

first day of autumn
a six-month old heating bill
in my jacket pocket

lincoln memorial
a battlefield
of amateur photographers

another late night
falling asleep
just as the taxi passes my street

watching the weather channel
i smile
at your forecast

dupont circle
a young man banging cans
for money

last day of september
a cool morning breeze
tests the leaves

rush hour
a beautiful woman
helps a blind man
cross the street

following
the tattoo
up the back of her leg

first day of october
shivering
in a sidewalk cafe

windless autumn night
the sudden gust
of a passing freight train

first frost
in the back of the closet
a pile of unmatched gloves

clinging to my shoe
the season’s
first brown leaf

the perfect boston pub
where nobody
knows my name

a crowd of pigeons
feeds from the hand
of a homeless man

the leaves change color
my three older children
unable to visit me

boston fog
the cold medicine
kicks in

the leaves change color
my older children
unable to visit

october commute
racing the darkness
home

hidden in his newspaper
a wedding magazine
peppered with post-it notes

five years later
the neighborhood tomboy
is a woman

five years later
the neighborhood tomboy’s
womanly curves

brilliant red
sunlit autumn leaves
and my eyes

warm october day
putting away
the air conditioner

those dark sunglasses
can she see me
staring at her?

dark sunglasses
can she see me
staring at her?

extra-inning victory
an unopened bottle
of my favorite beer

the umpire’s bad call
a rotten peanut
at the bottom of the bag

october rain
a blanket
of wet leaves

baseball season ends
a pile of golden leaves
scattered by the wind

october rain
the perfect curveball
skipped between puddles

waiting for the train
so many shades of orange
in the maple tree

the install team
orders another catered meal
tasteless and extra crispy

walking past the rescue mission
i clutch a stack
of unpaid bills

overcast sky
the church steeple
just as gray

dewey square
a drunk man argues
with pigeons

late october night
the willow branches also
want to touch the moon

asleep on the train
the dow falls
from her lap

through the bare tree branches
our neighbor’s ugly paint job

nearly all the leaves
have fallen
new wrinkles on my face

reading a casino ad
the conductor asks
for my ticket

late-night disco
the resounding clarity
of her see-through blouse

downtown boston pub
yankee baseball cap on the floor
unclaimed

reflecting candlelight
her bedroom eyes

unable to sleep
unable to stay awake
the rhythm of the train

warm autumn day
searching through a pile of leaves
for the baseball

sleepless night
searching for dew
beneath brittle leaves

november in boston
the streets are lined
with skyscraper shadows

downtown crossing
the trashman
sings

kissing
on the merry-go-round
the city blurs

natick center
answering her cell phone
she smiles at me

november warm spell
she jogs through city traffic
in a white tank top

november storm
the trees surrender
their golden leaves

asleep on the train
one more golden leaf
falls to the ground

overnight storm
so many golden leaves
on the ground

fresh from the recycle bin
a homeless man
reads yesterday’s horoscope

korean war monument
decorated
with withered flowers

following a sleepless night
impenetrable morning haze

happily married couple
exchanging
email

new england suburb
the old church’s
white vinyl siding

cochituate twilight
beyond the pale horizon
the mass pike rumbles

renku party
the moon shimmers
in a glass of wine

cochituate twilight
a doe and fawn
scavenge for berries

a northerly wind
my sons and i
stack firewood

november rain
gray melts
into gray

late autumn color
fresh graffiti
on the train station wall

restless night
the green eyes
of the cat

troubled sleep
grandfather clock
in need of oil

troubled sleep
a truck crashes
through an ice puddle

first snow flurry
even the blue jays
are silent

first snowfall
reaching for the camera
before the shovel

averting my gaze
from her deep blue eyes
the sudden chill

bare tree branches
rake
the november sky

warm november day
golfers rake the 7th green
with their putters

crowded subway car
the smell of her hair

a few yellow leaves
cling to the old maple
warm november morning

november night
stepping from the train
into a full moon

holiday gridlock
evening fog
settles in

thanksgiving rain
sparrows take shelter
beneath the evergreen

winter fog
feeling the absence
of crickets

football sunday
the uniformity
of unraked leaves

winter morning
watching my breath rise
and disappear

snow in the air
the taste
of road salt

interrupting
another nightmare
a passing train

pub regulars
matching piles
of peanut shells

christmas shopping
the long wait
between mouse clicks

eighteen days
before christmas
slow steady rain

old theatre
the sound of hiking boots
sticking to the floor

the pouncing cat
chases you
from my dream

december twilight
steam rises
from a storm sewer

on either side
of the windshield
december fog

after one too many
the run in her stocking
scowls at me

waiting for the train
wind-battered leaves
plastered to the fence

unemployment line
sunlight fills a scratch
in the plexiglass window

ignoring
rush hour traffic
i avoid the ice puddle

on the late train
a boy too tired to cry
freezing drizzle

my wife’s birthday
i finally find
the perfect rose

curdled cream
and bitter coffee
a fax from my attorney

winter solstice
sharing breakfast
with sunrise

cold and alone
in the eastern sky
millennium moon

gifts finally wrapped
a piece of tinsel
follows the cat

the night after christmas
putting away
the less-favored toys

port jefferson ferry
unloads its cargo
cigarette perfume

playing football with my sons
the taste of trampled grass

outside starbuck’s
a shivering man waits patiently
for spare change

y2k-ready
a shabbily dressed woman
feeding pigeons

september fog
the soft lights
of the morning train

walking down pennsylvania avenue
i count more languages
than volkswagens

dc tavern
environmentalists
belch

too tired to cry
freezing drizzle

lost in washington
two bostonians
and their taxi driver

union station
the deep dark shine
of a prostitute’s boots

too busy partying
to fill the bird feeder

warm winter day
chasing mosquitoes
with a ski glove

holidays over

the christmas tree

january rain
the unopened letter
my daughter left behind

between me
and the next cold beer
a broken down train

indefinite delay
no there’s no chance
she’ll smile at me

running for the train
such a beautiful day
to stay home

pale blue sky
the deepening chill
of her eyes

black ice
the sound
of spinning tires

a hug
from my eldest son
deep orange sunset

planning my vacation
a button missing
from my shirt

the pager sounds
seagulls circling
above the sunrise

in the o
of family court house
sparrows build a nest

snow falls lightly
the cat burrows
between quilts

the nasdaq drops
snowflakes cling
to a styrofoam cup

fallen soldier
gazes into the twilight
the bitter cold

bitterly cold
a box of old love letters
hidden in the attic

single-digit temperatures
the cracks deepen
in my exwife’s makeup

17 across
silently i complete
her crossword puzzle

bitterly cold
the dog barks
all night long

waiting for the eclipse
i see
only clouds

mixed precipitation
the 709 train
is right on time

primary day
unable to part my hair
on the right or left

busy night at the pub
the barmaid’s
shiny navel

sleet falls
on leafless trees
i miss my home

waiting for the conductor
with a ticket in her hand
she sleeps

while the sparrows wait
a fat squirrel
empties the bird feeder

a long day ahead
behind thickening clouds
sunrise

after four hours of sleep
light snow fills
an empty cup

a brief surprise
her ultra-short
miniskirt

after the funeral
a grieving father
drowns himself in beer

approaching cold front
as i get up from bed
the cat takes my place

boarding the train
a stranger sits in
my favorite seat

missing the train
seagulls fly in and out
of the dumpster

waiting
for the alarm to ring
a truck engine idles

freedom trail closed
due to construction
boston

watching the disney channel
my son’s
animated expression

winter rain
a snowman
bows his head

ink runs down
the personals page
valentine’s day rain

february 15th
a wind-blown
flower stand

sleepless night
the bakery window’s
thickening mist

icy wind
the approaching train
so painfully slow

departed lover
a business card
on the night stand

snow turns to rain
canceling
the renku party

wind blown snow
she lets down her hair

moonless night
footprints filled
with melted snow

tucked in sickbeds
each child waits
for a turn to cough

winter sky
clutching my coffee
the moon sets

starless night
my children forget
to wave goodbye

reflected
in melting snow
bare tree limbs

mid-winter thaw
the run
in her stocking

inner harbor fog
the dark hum
of a big ship

the face
of a monday morning commuter
thickening clouds

making love in the dark
the moistness of her lips

the dow recovers
the beggar’s
dirty coffee cup

summer daydream
the sun caressing
her tight turquoise minidress

a day of meetings
a housefly trapped
between panes of glass

march madness
i make a perfect free throw
into the recycle bin

another late night
through her black silk stocking
a dragon tatoo

monday morning drive
through the frost on my windshield
a cloudless blue sky

moving day
no more room
in the box labelled miscellaneous

through the picture window
is she looking at me
or her reflection?

market forecast
record warmth
followed by rain

by the third forehead smudge
i remember
it’s ash wednesday

weekend approaching
she shivers
in a flowered sundress

the old cat
a mouse hurries past
the sound of snoring

dropping temperatures
an old girlfriend’s photo
on the web

missing the early train
the tattered edges
of my favorite jeans

in the afterglow
reaching
for the cat

the nasdaq falls
outside the pub seagulls fight
over roadkill

unlocking the car door
i sigh
crocuses in bloom

in the produce aisle
a voluptuous woman
compares melons

the nasdaq falls
time to plant
the chile peppers

commuter couple
synchronizing
palm pilots

unannounced stop
paying bills on the train
my pen runs out of ink

falling to the carpet
from her long red hair
st. patrick’s day snow

first day of spring
her white flowered sundress
and winter jacket

early spring morning
the violent wind
of a passing express train

government center
white sneakers negotiate
the icy steps

threatening sky
today she rides the train
alone

dangling from a corner
of my daughter’s bedroom mirror
a teddy bear angel

empty golf course
my children’s sand castles
carefully preserved

restless night
the cat keeps chasing you
from my dreams

returning
from a weekend trip
the empty birdcage

cold march rain
my son’s
long-distance tears

asleep on the train
the rusty rhythm
of my dreams

bryant park bench
surrounded by daffodils
an old man sleeps

after the rain
bare tree branches sparkle
in perfect stillness

almost april
so many tree branches
without words

low on batteries
i forget my cell phone

leaning against a crooked tombstone
the constellations in the sky

first monday
of daylight savings
the thickening clouds

unshaven
i savor a peach

guiding our van
between the lines
my children sleep

wild ride on wall street
my favorite pot hole
remains unfilled

unexpected smile
a lone duck
glides across the pond

opening day
the long fly ball
of my dreams

bedroom renovation
the sound
of the woodpecker

april wind
clutching the hem
of her skirt

the mockingbird laughs
what have i ever
done to you?

april snow
the shade tree
full of crows

lost
in a cold april wind
the robin’s song

also falling
on wall street
april snow

spring chill
her sky blue eyes
turn away

long day ahead
the candy machine
steals my change

giving change
to the blind man
a beautiful woman

the dow falls
dandelion seeds
scattered in the wind

holding paint-stained hands
a young couple married
to their old house

piercing
her pretty smile
a tear-shaped diamond

my son’s eleventh birthday
miles of cold gray rain
between us

what day is it?
slow steady rain

downtown irish pub
three beers later
he’s a republican

good friday
a moment of silence
on wall street

reflecting
the graffiti landscape
soho rain

brooklyn heights
a broken swing
in a crowded playground

fenway park rain
the hotdog vendor
yawns

one day after easter
all that’s left of her kisses
are scattered foil wrappers

question of the day
who will rescue elian
from my tv screen?

passing fenway
on the way to work
a perfect baseball day

bright city lights
i cannot see
the moon

late april snow
melting on contact
with her cleavage

falling beside
the forsythia blossoms
late april snow

sleeping on the train
i watch her
sleeping on the train

from 30,000 feet
the lazy bends
of the mississippi

surrounding the foundation
of the old stone church
wild azaleas

mass pike traffic
the bright red glare
of her lipstick

all alone
on the last train
a crumpled pile of newspapers
and me

piercing
the overcast
stiletto heels

waiting for the ferry
an empty cup
floats beside the dock

mother’s day rush
picking through the wilted roses
at k-mart

a beautiful day
three empty lines
in my haiku notebook

tent revival
the preacher’s wife
in a miracle bra

waiting for the school bus
line after line
of freshly mowed grass

too late for morning coffee
the express train rushes by

overcast morning
the echo
of a passing freight train

airport delay
flocks of seagulls
land and take off

home late from work
that old cat smell

the taxi driver’s story
so captivating
we miss my exit

clinging
to her silky calf
a raindrop

the nasdaq hits another low
my old van’s flickering tail lights

morning fog
writing up my to-do list
the pen runs out of ink

three years after our first date
we try to schedule a celebration

empty mouse trap
a cloudless spring morning

troubled sleep
even my wife hears
the imaginary pager

wall street recovers
the bony shoulder blades
of our old cat

first day of june
i can finally retire
the ice scraper

tearing a page
from my notebook
she blots her lipstick

casual friday
her unbraided hair

summer lightning
reflected
in the cat’s eyes

pinned
to her tattered sundress
a wild iris

just in time for the train
morning overcast

between nightmares
the soft rumble
of the mass pike

awakened by silence
we search for the footsteps
of our cat

one more long summer
sunday’s crumpled sports section
misses the basket

standing room only
i adjust the moustache
of a billboard supermodel

always waiting
for the next train
wild irises

asleep on the train
the gentle rise and fall
of her breasts

bottle in hand
i dance
with the stars

reaching for the line drive
my son grows
before my eyes

racing for the train
his designer shoes

her phone number
on the back of a coaster
disconnected

after the bank merger
teller lines
twice as long

rearranging his gym bag
he stuffs in
a graduation gown

all alone
in the pre-dawn haze
father’s day moon

father’s day mist
voicemail
from my children

fading in and out
the distant car alarm
of my dreams

the longest day
i still can’t look her in the eye
without sunglasses

summer begins
beads of condensation drip
from a beer bottle

mass pike underpass
a tangled wreckage
of flowers and words

hot summer morning
the unexpected breeze
from a passing train

muggy summer night
following a bead of sweat
between her breasts

all alone
in a cool quiet corner
the homebrew ferments

threatening sky
one more day
the letter remains unsent

reading an old letter
i remember the color
of her eyes

crowded subway car
the fragrance of flowers
on her sundress

independence day
sweating out the week
before pay day

midsummer fireworks
four young girls
in bikini tops

between performances
the circus clown
lights up a cigar

back from vacation
her faraway tan

post-independence day fireworks
her brand new nightie
falls to the ground

crowded train
a fight breaks out
between perfumes

bright sunlight
through scratched plexiglas
a long day ahead

the last curl unfurls
from my daughter’s perm
low-lying clouds

watching my three sons sleep
dew streaks on the bedroom window

dockside brass band
a child’s red balloon
dances in the wind

the ferry departs
a crying child points
to his lost balloon

first sip of coffee
are the clouds above me
forming or breaking?

what a racket!
the neighborhood mechanic’s
old jalopy

morning rain
i wonder if my children
are still sleeping

back to work
an old cat
awakened by sparrows

turning forty-one
a wild rose
among weeds

crowded train
talking to a stranger
she braids her daughter’s hair

asleep on the train
a gull soars
between skyscrapers

adjusting my watch forward
i count the beers
i’ve missed

cool august morning
clutching my coffee mug
with both hands

mass pike traffic
racing against
the end of summer

dropping my palm pilot
its memory flashes
before my eyes

her well-tanned shoulders
wrapped in a sweater
the end of summer

no survivors
the glow of the tv test pattern
at 4 a.m.

stranded at south station
a red balloon against
the ceiling

at the health club
a petite girl re-adjusts the weights
after i’ve used them

commuter daydream
i follow the slit in her skirt
into oncoming traffic

early morning workout
i bend down in the dark
to pick up my keys

cold coffee
each day the sun rises
a little lower in the sky

standing room only
a voluptuous woman prepares
for a bumpy ride

first day of school
alone at the bus stop
the new kid shivers

our second anniversary
a pair of wild irises
in full bloom

commuter sunrise
squinting
between trees

home from work late
a fox scurries
across the street

overcast morning
the flickering glow
of an oncoming train

chinatown morning
crossing
yesterday’s dishwater

troubled sleep
somewhere in the darkness
an unlocked door

sweet sixteen
my daughter still smiles
in her sleep

sixteen across
a seven-letter word
for too far away

autumn moon
the glowing embers
of the wood stove

the alarm clock sounds
in total darkness
autumn rain

the nasdaq falls
moss clings
to a weathered tombstone

clinging
to a barbed wire fence
the charlestown waterfront

dropping the series opener
i make a note
to order fire wood

silence at the bus stop
another walkman
joins the crowd

autumn overcast
the silence
of dampened leaves

too late for a beer
the cold driving rain

downtown crossing
a homeless man gives
directions to tourists

commuter couple
too rushed for a kiss
she spills his coffee

closing time
the boston skyline
even more hazy

restless night
the silence
between passing showers

finally off-duty
the veteran conductor
sleeps standing up

october fog
the weekend dissolves
into coffee

the great debate
colombian supremo
or dark roast?

pregnant commuter
her wall street journal
kicks

first colors of autumn
a bicycle courier’s
freshly dyed dreadlocks

post-season play begins
chasing spiders
from the wood pile

empty baseball field
a pigeon pecks
home plate

first frost
my wife’s
flannel pajamas

the weston toll booths
a cascade
of brake lights

the ferry arrives
a solitary gull flies
in tightening circles

autumn overcast
our old cat’s
bony shoulders

trying to read
my on-line horoscope
page cannot be displayed

rubbing my eyes
the spots won’t go away
ladybugs on the ceiling

on the plastic seat
of a number 7 train
an unclaimed baseball glove

grandma turns ninety
somewhere in the distance
a cold wind howls

crossing the triboro
a shower
of blue and orange balloons

anticipating
another long work day
pale cloudless sky

passing an old girlfriend’s house
neat piles of freshly raked leaves

last stop
an abandoned baseball glove
on the number 7 train

empty subway car
avoiding another
beautiful day

first snowfall
i need a shovel
to find my boots

setting the clocks back
my hair
is no less gray

visiting my daughter’s campus
a last leaf
clings to the tree

mass pike traffic
the slow grind
of clenched teeth

halloween rain
two unopened bags of candy
just for us

tired of the baby’s teasing
an old dog pretends to sleep

glaring through
leafless branches
november sun

too close to call
two snowflakes
race toward the ground

long after the fire is gone
our old cat
sits by the wood stove

missing the early train
clouds race past
bare tree limbs

a quiet thanksgiving
five empty place settings
at the table

election recount
27 shopping days
before christmas

snow in the forecast
a sparrow perches
on the empty bird feeder

staring at her neckline
the deep plunge
of the nasdaq

moving day
gently dusting off
a family photo

a decisive victory
the chipmunk opens
a sunflower seed

december sunrise
a blood red nectarine
warming in my hand

lunch hour
the atm
eats my card

snow in the forecast
fat squirrels race
through unraked leaves

the accidental poet
spilling my coffee
i wave goodbye

icy wind
rushing
to avoid the begger

news from my home town
the hawk seems so peaceful
when circling above

brooklyn heights promenade
a young bulldog
strains against the leash

after the rain
the bold bright color
of her lipstick

casual workplace
unshaven
i savor a peach

bourbon street morning
hosing down the sidewalks
for another day

last call
second-hand smoke
lingers

smiling in her sleep
i wonder
what she is dreaming

on the express train
newlyweds share
a wall street journal

a train approaches
descending the stairway
she smiles

racing for the train
the creme-filled donut
i left behind

turning forty-one
a weed
in the rose garden

london rain
a pair of americans
without umbrellas

halloween morning
cleopatra
serves me coffee

from curb to crosswalk
and back again
pigeons gather breadcrumbs

jackson square
between solos the old man dances
with his trombone

waterloo sunset
the glitter of cellophane
floating on the thames

halloween commute
broom hilda
waits for the bus

mcsorley’s old ale house
generations of sawdust
cling to our shoes

new orleans jazz club
the rhythm of the sweat
of the tuba player

london sunshine
back in new york
my youngest son turns nine

leaving manhattan
our train
bathed in sunset

dangling from the streetcar roof
faded mardi gras beads

seven sisters
emerging from the underground
into dreadlocks

startled from sleep
was it the mass pike
or a lonely trombone?

king’s cross
embarassed by voices
with american accents

london tower
guards in period costume
monitor video cameras

london underground
the silence
of a crowded train

watching over the english countryside
the towers of a nuclear power plant

north yorkshire pub
a sloppy kiss
from a friendly dog

atop the ruins
of a yorkshire castle
a well-pierced teenager sleeps

morning in montreal
a joyful reunion
with our luggage
may-22-2000

phillips square
a pigeon sits on the head
of a mighty king
may-22-2000

st. catherine's street
a disheveled man begs
in two languages
may-22-2000

latin quarter café
one more hour
to drink it all in
may-22-2000

light snow
the phone rings
unanswered

away on business
the restless cat
on your side of the bed

revolving door
the smoker
loads, lights and puffs

he yawns
i grimace
the old cat’s breath

stranded on the taxiway
the last unsalted nut

windowless meeting room
a cascade
of stifled yawns

stranded on the taxiway
the last unsalted nut

snow mixes with rain
my mother keeps calling me
by my brother’s name

clutching my water bottle
day two
of the diet

sliver moon
in the morning sky
she sleeps on the train

waiting patiently
at the end of this diet
a six-pack of beer

unable to sleep
our next-door neighbor
stares at our house

temptation island
a lonely ice cream sandwich
in the freezer

snow in the forecast
a scowl from a woman
i don’t even know

unplowed snow
an old girlfriend
visits my website

standing room only
should i tell her that i know
seventeen across?

by cup number three
the caffeine kicks in
my mother’s birthday

hanging from the rim
of a basketball net
an icycle

super bowl sunday
a lull in the action
between commercials

our old cat sleeps
on the heating vent
winter rain

a long day ahead
locking the door behind me
i forget my keys

between
sleeping commuters
sunrise

waiting for the train
impatient clouds of breath

after so many thorns
a rare and perfect rose

where dirty snow
meets road salt
a dozen roses

ash wednesday
the priest
lights a cigarette

home sick from work
the old cat
sleeps on my head

ocean breeze
leaving my watch
behind

after hours of shoveling
i have no energy
for winter haiku

vacation flashback
unable to taste the ocean
in the road salt

buried under boots
placencia sand clings
to my sandals

the nasdaq plunges
the dark forbidden shadow
between her breasts

ankle deep in slush
the market opens

winter rain
the deepening lines
of my face

waiting room
doctors and nurses
at play

skunk in a trap
my wife and i stare
at our portfolios

march madness
playing to lose
on wall street

st. patrick’s day
the courier’s dreadlocks
dyed green

alone in a queen-sized bed
the moon’s reflection
in ice-covered branches

january morning
waiting for the train
i count coughing passengers

black monday
the snowman’s hat
on a pile of sand

morning afterglow
the hungry cat
can wait

last week of winter
shivering i daydream
of short skirts

energy crisis
long line
at the coffee shop

first day of spring
the train conductor flirts
with schoolgirls

spring rain
a young girl
weeps

alone on the platform
a young girl weeps
spring rain

spring snow
an expecting mother rests
her hands on her belly

let’s just be friends
a mouse caught in the trap
stops struggling

a cold cup of coffee
my daughter’s tuition bill

march nor’easter
a steady downpour
of broken umbrellas

trapped
the insomniac hears
a mouse in the wall

opening day the lingering effects
of anaesthesia

listening to the stock report
a dark street filled with pot holes

updating my resume
a sudden power outage

picking up the pace
the echo of footsteps
my own

even shorter than her skirt
his new girlfriend’s temper

hospital graffiti
repent of your sins
or you will perish

the heat comes on
our old cat inches closer
to the vent

the train arrives
one more sip
from an empty cup of coffee

slow-moving clouds
when and where
will they stop?

waiting for the ferry
the janitor whistles
out of tune

late arrival
tired of pacing
i pace

my exwife in love
rain trickles through
cracks in the gutter

wedding night
the parents of the bride
in separate beds

back to work
a dull throbbing pain
between the temples

my son’s twelfth birthday
a rabbit hops
across the busy street

awakening from a deep sleep
the train enters south station

april sunshine
i bend down to pick up
an unscratched lottery ticket

moments before sunrise
the cat moves
from my side of the bed
to yours

waiting in the examination room
i formulate my diagnosis

still in the waiting room
the crossword puzzle
i finished yesterday

sunny spring day
walking through a cloud
of perfume

may day
how boldly she parades
her legs

may frost
her cell phone conversation
with everyone on the train

rising earlier each day
the sun
and my blood pressure

a windsurfer capsizes
my second margarita
tastes nothing like the first

same time every day
a mouthful of warm water
from the fountain

heat wave
following a bead of sweat
between her breasts

shining
in the phosphorescent light
her sundress

shining
in fluorescent light
her sundress

asleep in the sun
the wise teacher dreams
of catching mice

staring at me
from the bathroom mirror
an age spot

mist turns to rain
our cat’s last day

the food dish untouched
i swear i heard
his footsteps last night

why get out of bed
without our impatient cat
demanding breakfast?

one more guinness
and i’ll believe
that even i am irish

at the local pub
an undercover cop
runs up his tab

telling my children
our cat is gone
a gull crosses the sun

the old tugboat
pushes a rusty barge
my exwife’s plus-sized dress

where he used to sleep
an empty space
between us

this chilly morning
colder
without our cat

so unappreciated
this desperately needed rain

interrupting
the perfect shit
a call from my exwife

not that you asked
but i do know
the name of that song

adding to my sadness
i leave the door open for the cat
who isn’t there

straining against the leash
our newly rescued dog
spots a butterfly

a new day
stepping over
the sleeping dog

too weak to move
our dog watches the sunlight
drink from her bowl

allston street corner
a drunk plays accordion
for himself

rush hour
the street musician plays through
a broken string

headphones on
she smiles
right through me

midnight
moonlight rests
on the sleeping dog

the pager sounds
a slight interruption
in my dog’s snoring

midnight lovemaking
careful
not to wake the dog

perfect day
putting the final touches
on a termination letter

my daughter’s graduation
tightening the knot
on my necktie

out cat’s final night
his soft purr
still echoes

my deepest sleep of the night
the train ride to work

two weeks after the storm
the dog still sleeps in our bed

morning haze
to take or not to take
the cold medicine?

train entering the tunnel
the taste of her lipstick

chatting up the schoolgirls
the train conductor forgets
to punch my ticket

crowded train station
the tap tap thump
of a blind man’s cane

after the downpour
a wet t-shirt contest

summer in the park
men rating women
from zero to ten

heat of the day
the dog stretches out
on the tiled floor

oh how it stings
the long slit
in her skirt

my daughter’s graduation
a gull almost motionless
above the waves

my daughter’s graduation
a gull separates
from the rest of the flock

suburban blight
satellite dish
on a leaky roof

valedictorian
shouting
over thunder

troubled sleep
water trickles through
the old stone foundation

disabled train
the hangover
kicks in

lightning on the horizon
she adjusts
her eye shadow

love in the air
a pair of cardinals
emerges from the bushes

my 42nd birthday
i still count
passing freight cars

the day’s only breeze
a passing express train

a break in the heat
my wife invites
the dog to bed

battle of the blues bands
the crowd cheers
a red sox victory

bad blues
the guitarist and audience
share pained expressions

garden in the woods
the sun hides
behind a cloud of bug spray

passing a cat
i hear meow
in three languages

photographing
poison ivy
i begin to itch

a sigh of relief
when the garden hose
doesn’t move

unimpressed
by my dragon shirt
dragonfly

at the end
of the nature walk
we count haiku poets

gingko walk
through the demolition site
haiku for hard hats

walking past pigeons
a flock of haiku poets

museum cafeteria
this thirteen dollar sandwich
is not a work of art

two for breakfast?
a berklee student
and his guitar

july
sunrise melts
the morning haze

oppressive heat
a woman yells at her child
in broken english

erasing
my favorite graffiti
the wrecking ball

distant thunder
a shower of pollen
falls from the trees

dangerous lightning
she watches me
watching her

playing baseball
with my sons
the rain holds off

two days after the game
my back is still sore
overcast sky

crescent moon
the band ignores our cries
for an encore

on-time arrival
dark clouds gather
at the end of the runway

unhooking her bra
the moon peeks
over the treetops

our dog is asleep
the hunt is on
for that old chew toy

tossing her hair over her shoulder
she smiles for the invisible camera

removing her panties
the warmstickysoftness
inside

summer rain
everyone in my house sleeps late
except me

a pregnant jogger
pushes a stroller past me
like i’m standing still

the haze lifts
she tosses her hair
over her shoulder

unshaven
i trim the hedges

hot day ahead
construction dust rises
to meet the smog

midsummer heat
as an act of mercy
i mentally undress her

troubled sleep
my own dog
barks at me

first i check for cash
birthday card
from my parents

home late from work
careful not to wake the dog
on my pillow

train running late
an ant climbs
the station wall

the woman smiles
at a crying child
the moon almost full

a woman smiles
at the crying child
three-quarter moon

a break in the rain
our dog
still covers her eyes

a woman smiles
at the crying child
gibbous moon

hot august morning
just how uncomfortable
is her beautiful hair?

hot summer night
the opening act
melts into the crowd

crowded bus
she says she doesn’t find
body odor offensive

planning our trip
lightning flashes
beyond the horizon

first day of vacation
shooting star
on a moonless night

brigette bardot’s lips
kiss me
from an old movie poster

sand point sunset
a sandpiper chases
wave after wave

cool august breeze
why am i standing here
waiting for the train?

my daughter starts college
another empty
pint of beer

an acorn falls
the weight
of my daughter’s luggage

the end of summer
my light beer
suddenly darker

following a school bus
my coffee grows cold
the end of summer

full moon
so lonely
on a starless night

the pond at midnight
a dragonfly
lands on the moon

between silent
construction cranes
the milky way

my daughter’s birthday
watching how far
a dandelion can fly

raindrops cling
to a fallen leaf
the numbness

back to work
no stars
in the pre-dawn sky

the cell phone
smells like last night’s beer
a long day ahead

a new day
the pacifist
sets a mouse trap

economic recovery
i find my missing t pass

restless night
the dog barks
at nothing

preparing for war
a chipmunk chatters
from a low-hanging branch

a familar name
on the victims list
my coffee grows cold

the peacemaker
surrounded on all sides
by fog

yes the sun still rises
but so much lower in the sky

autumn colors
the receptionist’s
bright red hair

autumn in reverse
the receptionist’s hair turns
from brown to red

harvest moon
the dog brings
a dirty sock to bed

harvest moon
a cat emerges
from the dumpster

harvest moon
all the beautiful women
on the other side
of the tv screen

harvest moon
rescue workers
shovel debris

restless night
my wife and dog snore
out of sync

disabled train
how long until my kids
return my phone calls?

what might have been
the south tower
still smouldering

indefinite delay
i’m still not too tired
to stare at her legs

five days before pay day
lint and dog hair
in my wallet

closing time
my new best friend
the bartender

poetry slam
the air thick with sweat
and espresso

terror from the sky
the season’s first
snow flurry

the attack begins
a perfect day
for football

blue moon
the kids are gone
and my wife is naked

first frost
i trim
my graying beard

in the waiting room
every damned crossword puzzle
already filled out

bright and empty
october sunrise
over fenway park

three shades too dark
the lipstick
on his collar

more leaves in the trees
than on the ground
a phone call from my daughter

myers-briggs exercise
i identify the extroverts
and avoid them

alone in my car
i open another beer
autumn sunset

running for the train
a brittle leaf
clings to my shoe

refugee crisis
another friend
sends me a resume

my hero
wearing a short skirt
on such a cold day

a cold morning
wondering why
we stopped having sex

a letter from my daughter
holding my breath
i smile

through layer upon layer
of wool and flannel
her warm soft breasts

approaching storm
my twelve year-old’s fascination
with war

afghan invasion
the dog
on my side of the bed

halloween party
osama bin laden
empties the keg

dismantling the air conditioner
an empty bird nest falls

winterizing
a bird nest falls
from the air conditioner

halloween at the office
cat woman points and clicks
with her mouse

november fog
those damn yankees
win again

turning back the clock
her breasts still soft
to the touch

carpet bombing
the dog’s
little accident

stalled train
another line
in my haiku notebook

stalled train
trying to remember
when we last made love

snow mixes with rain
i’ve survived
this round of layoffs

restless night
snow changes to rain
and back again

new moon
an abandoned car
on lover’s lane

full-body kisses
following her snake tattoo
through hilly terrain

secluded mountainside
you place my hands
on your breasts

teeth clenched
her lips are parted
by his tongue

vietnam vet
sleeps off saturday night
on the vfw steps

veteran’s day
an american flag drapes
the homeless man’s cart

sleepless night
the flying horse next store
sleeps

i dream
of covert operations
and your sleek black dress

on the phone with my exwife
the dog chases its tail

my exwife on the phone
the dog chases its tail

thanksgiving week
my parents’ wedding gifts
come down from the attic

secluded mountain road
the sign reads
dangerous curves

thanksgiving week
censoring my son’s cd collection

just one more minute of sleep
the dog won’t stop
licking my face

holiday traffic
an empty paper cup
rolls past my car

bad art museum
a woman in black vinyl
gives me the eye

thanksgiving leftovers
my mother reminisces
about my exwife

care package from mom
a jumbo bag of doritos
and a bible

29 days before christmas
cigarette smoke engulfs
the bar stool next to mine

disabled train
a throbbing pain
between the eyes

unable to sleep
a train sounds its horn
in thickening fog

in a dark corner
of the church parking lot
i open another beer

burial at sea
miscalculating the breeze
i choke on her ashes

november rain
silence
at the dinner table

last day of november
the lingering sizzle
of the wood stove

last day of november
bare tree branches
pierce the fog

feeling like december again
a birthday card for my father

already december
another birthday
for my father

a smile escapes
from her pouting lips
i capture it

warm december day
sunlight glimmers
on an empty swing set

racing against the clock
i lose
another game of solitaire

stealing a kiss
who knew i’d find myself
on your most wanted list

preparing for war
my pc reboots

my, you are prepared
a spare toothbrush
in the original packaging

mid-winter diet
the emptiness
of carrot sticks

going down on me
the firm grip
of her soft hands

balancing my portfolio
i spill coffee
everywhere

an early christmas gift
our dog’s first romp
in the snow

that awkward moment
at the end of a first date
my condom or yours?

december thaw
the snowman
weeps

dirty snow
a row of blank expressions
waiting for the train

market forecast
mixed precipitation
followed by darkness

christmas shopping for my wife
like cheating
only more expensive

cold rain
hurrying past
a homeless man

stalled train
plenty of time
to imagine her naked

surprise visit from an old friend
frost hardens on my windshield

surprise visit
from an old friend
another pint of home brew

stalled elevator
his eyes slowly rise and fall
on her body

one day late
christmas snow

missing the train
two crows fight
over roadkill

dirty snow
two crows fight
over roadkill

full moon
shadows play
between her breasts

after one day of sunbathing
the pale white flesh
beneath the wedding ring

spring rain
a young girl weeps

on-time departure
i’m reminded
of my first love

it feels like december again
a birthday card for my father

racing
against the clock
i lose

balancing my portfolio
i exchange smiles
with a stranger

three beers later
the words of this notebook
sway in the wind

spring rain
alone on the platform
a young girl weeps

december again
a birthday card
for my father

second honeymoon
between you and me
the wet spot

fully armed with sunscreen
the clouds roll in

sudden downpour
the horizon
disappears

i tell you
i’ll love you forever
a coconut falls

in the lounge
strong margaritas
and watered-down reggae

its whistling pitch deepens
with every mouthful
beer bottle in the wind

our last full day in belize
a snake slithers by

fresh out of reading material
the plane enters a holding pattern

back in the states
a blind man activates
his spring-loaded cane

watching the ball drop
my champagne
goes flat

new year’s day
the cork from a champagne bottle
under our bed

new year’s resolution
no more hangovers
like the one i have now

back to work
my new wallet stuffed
with credit card receipts

unable to sleep
street puddles
turn to ice

winter morning
the glow
of fair-weather clouds

january rain
my daughter disappears
into the jetway

slipping on the ice
i clutch my laptop

south station
everyone ignores the crazy man
except the pigeons

my daughter’s midnight snack
sets off the smoke alarm

economic optimism
my jar of pennies
almost full

lights out
my fingers discover
another piercing

midwinter night
the wind howls
the dog sleeps

translating for her father
a young girl asks
will he live?

icy chinatown street
i slip
on chicken fat

the dog sleeps
the drunks howl
midwinter night

overnight freeze
waiting for news
about grandma

morning thaw
a voice on the phone tells me
that grandma is gone

remembering grandma’s
arroz con pollo
the plane descends

stopping for a shoe shine
i remember brooklyn

funeral mass
an elderly priest
awakens to incense

forty-two years old
and my aunts still tell me
how much i’ve grown

whiskey blue
the dj
and his silk curtain

sliver moon
the scowl
on grandma’s face

my uncle whispers
and then he left the priesthood
snow begins to fall

sliding on an ice patch
i daydream
about baseball

frozen river bed
when will we
make love again?

midwinter thaw
wiping my forehead
with a ski glove

wilted flowers
a vacancy
at the old age home

tropical honeymoon
her moans of passion
silence the crickets

midnight serenade
the resonance
of her g-string

midwinter thaw
a cautious smile
from a stranger

boston sports bar
the state of the union address
on mute

one more ipa
the president
waxes eloquent

the late train
the stench of beer
on my breath

disappearing
into a cloudless sky
a child’s balloon

troubled sleep
a wet and empty street
before dawn

a dark parking lot
two lovers
think they’re alone

midwinter chill
i thought it was your turn
to walk the dog!

stiff northern wind
my wife leaves
on a business trip

february sunshine
santa claus
sleeps in the park

death of a princess
on second thought
forget the scotch

crowded train
second-hand smoke
meets cheap cologne

interrupting a nightmare
south station
final stop

mardi gras footage
a familiar face
covered with a blouse

back in boston
a man with a dark tan
scrapes his windshield

asleep on the beach
i never dreamed
of this late spring snow

snow mixed with rain
drinking a beer
in the church parking lot

’milk with your coffee?’
the waiter inquires
of her breasts

march first
ice-covered branches
perfectly still

spring cleaning
maybe this year
i’ll throw out those love letters

march madness
our freshly bathed dog
writhes on the carpet

warming trend
i deepen her neckline
with my eyes

high above the treetops
a hawk watches me
march sunset

late winter snow
an icy spot
in my brother’s marriage

two days before spring
snow clings
to evergreen leaves

pouring another cocktail
my brother’s marriage
on the rocks

in the hallway
our shoelaces
intertwined

melting
with each lingering kiss
spring snow

spring thaw
each footstep
deepens

march madness
yesterday’s snowmelt
frozen solid

waiting for the train
an abandoned cigarette burns
down to the filter

april morning
the soft shadows
between her breasts

april overcast
an absence
of shadows

climbing into bed
the other woman
licks my face

troubled sleep
the clock flashes midnight
all night long

quiet country road
a traffic jam
escapes the city

recurring nightmare
the conductor wakes me
one stop too late

the big game
surviving
another week

morning fog
the conductor taps my shoulder
at the end of the line

patriot’s day rain
her watercolor flag
wrapped in plastic

warm spring night
the dog sleeps
in her own bed

remembering my appointment
the train runs behind schedule

record heat
she fans herself
with a wall street journal

morning after
the thunder grows silent
but dark clouds remain

after the storm
a hubcap
filled with stars

josiah’s birthday
no i will not
root for the yankees!

bending
to pick a rose
the sudden pain

cochituate tombstone reads
18 miles to boston

forsythias in bloom
my daughter turns nineteen

chilly morning
the dog
steals my blanket

between nightmares
a clear blue sky

forgetting
my subway face

she says i remind her
of someone she knows
morning chill

running to the interview
a stack of resumes
for his umbrella

beneath the robin’s nest
pure blue

under the robin’s nest
so blue

with purple hair

for africa

tumbleweeds cross
the interstate

half asleep
i half remember
an unfinished email

my daughter’s voicemail
a chipmunk darts
across the highway

almost warm
i leave my jacket
at home

startled from sleep
by nothing
starless night

a necklace dangles
between her breasts
mesmerizing jewels

first date - last date
the bartender
calls me a cab

after the rain
the deepening blue
of her eyes

thunderclouds without rain
another beer too many

tie me up, tie me down
the line forms
a lifetime ago

thunderclouds without rain
my wife cuddles
with the dog

examination room
imagining the taste
of rubbing alcohol

crossing houston street
our taxi hits a pot hole
instant haiku

flash of thunder
the dog takes her place
between us

meeting
my daughter’s boyfriend

orthopedist’s office
all paintings tilted
slightly off center

a deep voice
on the other end of the phone
my daughter’s special friend

the pc reboots
my brother moves in
with my parents

a chocolate covered cherry
on the tip of her tongue
i melt

desert rose
its withered petals
still clinging

two women
compare dating nightmares
wild daisies in bloom

unable to sleep
it’s been so long
since i’ve won at solitaire

last day of school
my son’s leg injury
mysteriously heals itself

slow night
the bartender
loses at backgammon

her spaghetti straps
al dente

a baby startles awake
to pomp &amp; circumstance

fabulous curves

his boyhood dreams
reduced to two words
batter up!

in the pastor’s spot

let me smell the flowers
on your sundress

with the heat

a tip of the hat
to the fenway faithful

of a child’s balloon

we are never so
honest, so true, as when
we lie together

my life reduced
to a market index
standard and poor

morning glories
our next-door neighbor’s lover
is right on time

heat wave
to ease your discomfort
i mentally undress you

in tightening circles
a moth extinguishes
the candle

not quite recovered
a wild and bumpy ride
on wall street

stood up
by a part-time lover
shooting star

standing erect
as she saunters by
city skyscraper

outside south station
a former day trader
plays the blues

lunch with the boss
the fly i thought i chased away
keeps coming back

the neighborhood pub
where too many people
know my name

plunging beneath
the lake’s surface
full moon and the dow

the unnerving plunge
of her neckline

forgetting wall street
i plunge
inside her

the bears
beat the bulls

up and down
the see-saw

beautiful girl
in a barren field
dreaming

wild flowers
so beautiful
i can’t pick them

fresh spraypaint
a heart, two pairs of initials
and forever
crossed out

my last memory
the taste of chalk dust
in the batter’s box

topless beach
she builds a sand castle
with two towers

my youngest turns eleven
our backyard
overrun with tall weeds

oppressive humidity
savoring every inch
of your wetness

oppressive humidity
my brother’s wife’s
personal ad

trumpet solo
the trombonist drains the spittle
from his mouthpiece

tense meeting
how could i forget
my doodle pad?

heat advisory
sweat flies from her body
with each thrust

tense meeting
her temper even shorter
than her skirt

in a dream
in a tenement far away
a faucet drips

daddy’s little girl
off to college
the unmowed lawn

another daughter in college
heat rises from the pavement

my daughter’s
first day of college
cold summer rain

restless sleep
a mouse in the attic
in search of a keyboard

a face i recognize
from the train station
sudden chill

translating
your body language
i grow harder

email from my daughter
sorry about tomorrow night
can we do lunch?

nobody stops
for the dead bird
except the flies

caught in a trap
i suffocate
the mouse

an unexpected letter
chilly winds
from all directions

mail call
my dog receives
another credit card offer

recurring nightmare
you leave me
for a younger dog

into the church dumpster

tomorrow’s weather
irrelevant

her black dress
tighter
than my bulging pants

shorts in the morning
flannel blankets at night
september comes to boston

leaning against
a skyscraper
i feel so small

september
leaves and rumors
continue to cling

found
where i never thought to look
the missing puzzle piece

behind the dumpster
a gray-brown woman
finishes someone’s dinner

trembling
a woman’s hands
on her pregnant belly

september 11th
an empty page
in my haiku notebook

gusting wind
a couple huddles together
to light a cigarette

as long as he’s paying
the bartender serves the drunk
another beer

summer’s last heat wave
the crossword puzzle
of her tan lines

friday the 13th
leaves scatter
in the cold wind

the warming sunshine
in her hair

autumn morning
new and vibrant colors
in my daughter’s hair

football season begins
time to dust off
those haiku journals

day of atonement
i regret having forgotten
how to regret

beautifully polished
if only my guitar
could play itself

election day over
the stakes from these campaign signs
make excellent kindling

leaves fall to the ground
but where will this
bear market land?

the yankees clinch
leaves begin to fall
in boston

autumn fog
i can barely see
my breath

one vulture asks another
has the market hit bottom yet?

the war is over
red sox fans
remove their hats

getting home late
i share my pillow
with the dog

october sunrise
a dark day
lies ahead

layoff day
splitting another log
on the wood pile

autumn’s first leaf
the inevitability
of the wood pile

crowded subway car
alcohol
on a stranger’s breath

another day
another storm
moves closer to shore

lightning flash
your naked body
next to mine

after the storm
a very different
horizon

a cat howls
the wind
changes direction

pay day
my creditors
exhale

silencing the alarm
the frightened squeal
of a dog toy

escalator down
what will wall street
bring me today?

of cut-out witches

the accordian player pauses
between sad songs

down the escalator
all those steps
i never took

the plywood bar
dances

inman square
ivy climbs
the abandoned tenement

fading
in and out of sleep
the moon sets

full moon
i love you
just because

one more hour
of nightmares

turned to the editorial page
the man sitting next to me
snores

halloween morning
two witches and a skeleton
wait for the bus

done with homework
i study
the librarian’s breasts

fall to the ground

black ice

from my exwife

black ice
my daughter’s tears

a new umbrella
november rain
surrounds me

all the pot holes
have rounded edges

reflecting clouds
the gilded dome
of the state house

asleep on the train
the conductor announces
the stop after mine

late night at work
the stench
of my favorite pub

a street poet
free associates

davis square
every red brick singing
a subway serenade

christmas approaching
my daughter’s boyfriend
calls me sir

veteran’s day
fresh flowers
at the old monument

steam rises
from a storm sewer

a leaf falls in the pond
i watch the ripples
disappear

buttoning up
her winter jacket
her cleavage disappears

boarding the train
a man argues
with his cell phone

the fog
is deaf

i can almost hear
the basement flooding

i wake up
with an erection

sneak a kiss

end of the holiday
the ferry departs
into murky waters

old and gray
a picket fence strains
against the snow

the old picket fence
not wishing
to disturb the snow

beyond
the unopened gate
wind-blown snow

snow in the forecast
a distant pounding
of war drums

speeding freight train
is my oldest daughter
really nineteen?

empty
without you

with school girls

wondering where
the gray squirrels hide

of the bartender’s broom

the colorful glow
of burning christmas wrap

to incense

when will we
make love again?

record heat
she fans her cleavage
with a wall street journal

my daughter turns nineteen
forsythias in bloom

beneath the robin’s nest
a broken eggshell
pure blue

thunderclouds without rain
unlike me
the train is right on time

fading in
and out of sleep
the moon sets

old and gray
a picket fence wavers
in the snow

the old picket fence
not wishing to disturb
the snow

speeding freight train
my wife’s birthday
six days away

pure blue
a broken eggshell
beneath the robin’s nest

december winds
i watch as she chases
after her hat

where christmas presents had been
dried pine needles

new year’s morning
fresh snow
fills the potholes

shoveling snow
i whistle
a beach boys tune

rumors of war
removing decorations
from the christmas tree

unable to hide
her delicate curves
a bulky sweater

snow-plowed streets
all cars
the color of road salt

partial thaw
the potholes
deepen

monday morning
waking up from a nightmare
before it ends

rrring!!!
six people reach
for their cell phones

approaching train
frantic puffs
on a freshly lit cigarette

hard at work
all of these people
to write about

cold spell continues
like my hair
the snow turns grayer

cold spell continues
each day it gets harder
to imagine you naked

meeting the new boss
outside
the same cold wind blows

halftime
two strangers
are strangers again

incomplete pass
the girl at the end of the bar
would rather watch football

my desire
shifts into overdrive
her parting lips

coldest day of the year
my credit card bill arrives

back to work
a new layer of frost
on my windshield

remembering
my mother’s birthday
a stray dog barks

sad news
the morning
couldn’t be colder

teenage troubles
i forfeit
another chess match

dirty snow
a cold that just won’t
go away

fresh snow
a cheerful email
from my daughter

reflected
in the rat’s eyes
times square

city sidewalk
a well-dressed man bends down
to pick up a quarter

this morning
the alarm clock sounds
further away

state of the union
painful numbness
in my fingertips

one beer too many
how beautifully the stars dance
on the ceiling

two wandering drunks
suddenly friends
with the piano player

on the other end
of beale street
mississippi sunset

mississippi bridge
a freight train
rides into the sunset

groundhog day
my own shadow
grows grayer

earth mother
her love letters
in the recycle bin

horny as hell
she makes me wait
for the next shooting star

crowded waiting room
i’m the only one
wearing headphones

waiting for her so much
unclaimed baggage

the business trip
sleeping on her side of the bed
without her

her kiss
i reach
for the moon

the business trip
the dog’s disappointment
that it’s only me in bed

home sick from work
a long day’s journey
into nyquil

trying to sleep
on a crowded train
the smell of newsprint

snow squall
my muscles ache
from winter kigo

waiting room
a young mother knits
her brow

our president
addresses the nation
a passing garbage truck

let’s turn off the news
and hold each other
extra long tonight

burning a flag
in the bitter cold
the chill

eighteen inches
of winter kigo
my aching back!

the charm
of a new england winter
my aching back!

melting snow
the fenway bleachers
glisten

first thaw
a melting icicle
drips into her cleavage

post-war planning
a man chokes to death
on unchewed steak

running for the train
a pothole fills
with melting snow

the silence
of a frozen hard drive

sad news
continuing cold
in the neighorhood

the weekend
patches of dead grass
in the dirty snow

winter weekend
warming up
to a cold ale

winter commute
monday morning’s
bitter wind

bitter morning
her kiss freezes
on my lips

peaceful dinner
a dry french wine
with my turkey

fatherhood
stepping on the phantom brake
when my son drives

under a melting snow bank
the sea gull’s next meal

the other side of beale street
a barge eases down
the mississippi

forty degrees
the music
of melting snow banks

continued cold
the oil delivery man
apologizes

in my dreams
when i awaken
the sound of a train

one day after pay day
half my bills
half-paid

waiting for x-rays
the spot on my glasses
won’t come off

she’s so drunk
he thinks she just might
come home with him

still echoing
in my beer-filled skull
the ’mwah’ of her kiss

a lull in the conversation
we search the bar
for first dates

bad blues band
how quickly can i consume
my two drink minimum?

war on the horizon
the full moon disappears
into fog

the president speaks
outside a dog barks
at its own echo

ready for battle
the dog chokes
on its leather leash

hundreds of brave young men
take up positions
march madness begins

the battle is joined
i take refuge
between her legs

the neighborhood bully
throws a rock at passing cars
and hides

south station
a little boy pets
the bomb-sniffing dog

bombs over baghdad
but my sleep is disturbed
by a chirping pager

like a scud missile
fired at random targets
the dow falls

behind a wall of black smoke
more assurances
from the pentagon

shares of nbc rise
on news the war
won’t pre-empt friends

church parking lot
my eyes grow accustomed
to the darkness

two blocks from the christian concert
solicitations from a cut-rate hooker

improves with every guinness

the freshness
of an updated resume

april fool’s day
the city is besieged
by another cold snap

the final battle
my seventeen year-old son
asks for the car keys

college night
the last of the snow banks
turns to mud

swing and a miss!
the neighborhood tomboy’s
newly improved curves

a boston pacifist’s prayer
may this war end
before the sox win it all

new moon
the cat sleeps
or does he?

in love with a soldier
she watches cnn
and masturbates

above the bare trees
winter storm clouds
the size of my fist

above the bare trees
winter storm clouds
the size of my fist

fair weather clouds
how long
until the next storm?

the battle resumes
shouts of protest
at the state house

drifting
in a puddle of mud
an empty coffee cup

warm weather forecast
i still scrape the frost
from my windshield

tax day
a red squirrel chatters
above my head

restless sleep
an old engine
rusting
in the trainyard

adolescence
the silence
between father and son

approaching cold front
letting the wind
blow through me

surprise!
liberated iraq
isn’t voting republican

now that my taxes
are in the mail
it’s cold again

so light in my hand
i imagine him flying
the dead bird

spring break
a pair of mourning doves
builds a nest

home sick from work
the dog and i
share a pillow

last week of april
the birds sing
while i scrape my windshield

cambridge side street
i know a shortcut
but this isn’t it

beale street
a street musician’s
sidewalk symphony

empty subway station
the accordian player
lights a cigarette

always faithful
the last train
waits for me

overcast morning
nobody wakes
the sleeping passenger

having finally won
at solitaire
the day begins

a beautiful day
how many more times
will i clear my throat?

my daughter turns twenty
light rain clings
to a leopard orchid

my daughter turns twenty
light rain clings
to a pure white orchid

running her fingers
through her long long hair
she glares at me

moving day
a laminated name tag
in the trash can

may in new england
the building i call work
enveloped in fog

moving day
a name
in the trash can

downtown crossing
the shadows
have wings

government center
a flock of pigeons
fights over crumbs

thank goodness!
another u.s. bean counter
to govern free iraq

late-night accident
a flare trampled
by speeding cars

writer’s block
a shadow
on the moon

pretending to be tourists
the transit cop
lets us keep our camera

harvard square
where starbuck’s
meets graffiti

leading the polls
in the human race
undecided

copley square
stone and steel
reaching for the sky

lost weekend
the blurred lights
of an inbound train

blurred vision
if only the train had come
two beers sooner!

sleepless night
buried under blankets
the dog sighs

while the city sleeps
pigeons rule
the subway

the perfect use
for a brick wall
my graffiti

too sad
for a nursery rhyme
may showers

the exwife calls
a warm skunky beer
poured down the sink

my daughter calls
azalea blossoms
filled with rain

grass stains on her blouse
no one asks
why she’s late for the meeting

the plough and stars
a collage of faded photos
and cobwebs

all-night supermarket
i get the shopping cart
with the shaky front wheel

the street musician’s dobro
reflected in his shades
life’s like a railway station

crowded elevator
i keep pressing
the same button

this perfect sunset
imperfect
without you

rain delay
my baseball glove doubles
as an umbrella

rain delay
my son wears his baseball glove
on his head

on hold
the sun traces an arc
through the sky

we need more rain
like i need more beer
he said, pouring another

more rain
an underground movement
of street musicians

the waiting room
all the crossword puzzles
filled in

proud to be gray
the old customs house

who is this woman
whose name is tatooed
on a man’s neck?

it isn’t love
until she’s shown you
all her tattoos

downtown crossing
the shadows speak
to one another

persistent drizzle
the conductor flirts
with schoolgirls

picking through the trash
a man whistles
an old blues tune

no spare change
the veteran’s flag
at half mast

waiting for the train
a woman prunes a stray thread
from her flowered dress

all thoughts
return to the void
my palm pilot resets

the market improves
a sick cat
drinks from a puddle

in a steam-covered mirror
a close shave

downtown bridgeport
weeds find the cracks
in an empty parking lot

sunday morning
the old dog
takes his time

staying in my hotel room
i lose another game
of solitaire

through sidewalk vents
the warm breeze
of a passing subway

crossing canal street
i ask the taxi driver
where are you taking us?

two fenced-in flower beds
filled with weeds
her chronic pain

cafe habana
the double espresso rush
of her bare shoulders

hot july morning
paw prints
on my windshield

crowded waiting room
the tv blares
a diarrhea commercial

making the all-star team
why can’t my gifted son
make his bed?

ball game over
we take off our clothes
a tight finish

partly sunny
or partly cloudy?
the wait for market open

red sox sweep
reads the man
with the bad toupee

critical alert
the pager interrupts
a critical moment

gloomy and gray
the morning sky
and me

fresh graffiti
it’s beautiful
but what does it say?

picking up my kids
the sign reads
rough road ahead

overcast night
why did you steal
my full moon?

greenspan speaks
a mother and seven ducklings
cross the highway

going down
her grip on the bedposts
tightens

summer love
moonlight reflected
in our undulating sweat

the wise lover
she cries faster
he whispers no

budget deficit
i guess i’ll have to skip
that third cup of coffee

budget time
would my bank overlook
a half trillion dollar deficit?

summer silk her nipples
find my eyes

unexpected chill
she notices me
noticing her nipples

her silk blouse
so tight
i could burst

intermission
a street musician removes the trash
from his coffee can

crowded department store
adjusting my posture
as i walk past the mannequins

church for rent
a cell phone tower
where the cross once stood

death to my enemy!
a moment of stillness
and then another mosquito

nothing but words
between us

waiting
for the interview to begin
slow steady rain

rushing to an important meeting
my umbrella turns inside out

fort point channel
the old barge
finds a hole in the dock

straining to see
her other tattoos

finding a rhythm
her words trail off
into sighs

heartbreak at fenway
a cold beer
abandoned

from a sound sleep
it’s still monday

dockside lunch
a sea gull
steals my sandwich

unable to write
a nature haiku
a moth flies down my shirt

power failure
a lonely night
without the web

the air thickens
with silence

the sound of a car alarm
lingers closer

the fireflies
grow dim

moths circle the light
of an oncoming train

approaching thunder
your grip tightens
as i enter you

clouds without rain
nomar strikes out
with the bases loaded

clear skies
the red sox break
a three-game slide

after 44 years
i no longer count
passing freight cars

for the walk signal

a businessman talks to himself
is his hands-free cell phone
just a prop?

gibbous moon
napoleon and i
share the same birthday

approaching storm
a spider web
shimmers in the breeze

approaching storm
the sky darkens
with crows

of sleep i missed

wearing a hands-free cell phone
the well-dressed businessman
talks to himself

summer rain
a sea gull
among pigeons

surprise shower
finally an umbrella
right where i left it

a coffee-stained folder
with my name on it

moonless night
i swear i heard
his footsteps last night

heavier than a sigh
my daughter’s luggage
for a long journey

rushes by

fire drill
engineers evaluate
the secretaries

the war is over
for one haiku poet seagull’s cry

a day of meetings
sea gulls hover
above the fishing boat

mars behind clouds
i focus the telescope
on my neighbor undressing

for a faraway place

across a maple leaf

trimming the hedges
i never met a rhododendron
i didn’t hate

soaks up the sun
in our fallow garden

awakened from a deep sleep

glisten

facing downtown
the pain
of what’s not there

her silhouette
in the fog

wild daisy
the tattoo
on her bare belly

to wild flowers

clinging
to my daughter’s toe ring
wild daisies

meets sky

above the treetops

remembering an old girlfriend
the sign reads
’entering shirley’

we invite the dog
into bed

in the leaves

the old dog
learns a new trick

staring back at me

almost full

for the first log

the man with the sunglasses
clutches his cup
and sleeps

october 16th
a butterfly disappears
over fenway park

flying home to boston
a baseball diamond
shines through the clouds

killing frost
the tomatoes
at half-mast

laughter from above
even the mockingbird knows
i’m a city boy

first snow
even the dog
would rather stay inside

a crumb falls down her blouse
i don’t remember
her question

that hour back

on my windshield

for a third time

how slowly the train moves
beneath them

in my dreams
they all melt away
winter clouds

slow train
the bickering
of an elderly couple

wishing he could fly
the snow-covered
pink flamingo

winter commute
stepping into
yesterday’s footprints

unable to sleep
the glow of the moon
against the snow

bent over by the snow
the mighty spruce
and me

snow to rain to ice
a persistent head cold
settles in my chest

a man begs for change
am i the bastard
who laid him off?

downtown crossing
the steel drum plays
silent night

winter rain
a sagging string
of christmas lights

nostalgia trip
the bus that used to take me
to the house i couldn’t afford

raindrops on my window
the face of a woman
i once loved

my son celebrates
his eighteenth birthday
longest night of the year

christmas eve
a pigeon trims its nest
with tinsel

christmas eve
santa’s favorite elf
wearing only tinsel

day after christmas
a red and white bow
on the dog

a bulky sweater
unable to hide
her delicate curves

more rain
the street musicians
go underground

proud to be gray
the old clock tower

greenspan speaks
the train stalls
one stop from its destination

death to my enemy!
barely a moment later
i hear another mosquito

in a patch of gravel
between stations
wild flowers

cool morning
dew clings
to wild flowers

winter rain
the echo of a blues guitar
in an empty club

winter rain
women dancing with women
at the night club

new year’s day
a fitness center
full of resolutions

white pond
hoofprints
on the other side

troubled sleep
the sound
of freezing rain

howling wind
bounced email
from a deceased friend

together at last
a bottle of tequila
and the desert moon

january commute
all eyes frozen to the spot
where the train should be

scent of roses
a blow job
in the back seat

late night of paperwork
crossing my eyes
and missing the t

full moon
the dog paces
back and forth

overcast night
the moon is waning
somewhere

startled from sleep
a dog barks
at the wind

winter night
the crunch of road salt
beneath my boots

late for the interview
fresh lipstick
on his collar

cancelled train
steam pours
from a storm sewer

mourning
the silence
of the mourning doves

the artist’s bedroom
four bare walls
and a broken lamp

64 days till spring
etched in dried salt
on the car’s rear window

the old cathedral
a baby shouts
at her own echo

through a scratch
in the plexiglas
sunrise

empty coffee house
the folk singer’s
heartache

after the breakup
a cigar i had saved
for anything else

crowded train
what’s so interesting
about my shoes?

graceland
red shag carpet
fades in the sunlight

further away
than it was yesterday
memphis moon

full moon
how brightly
the fresh snow shines

between sets
the stripper drags
on a cigarette

snow turns to rain
the dog climbs back
into my bed

stamping out his cigarette
the doctor unwraps
a piece of gum

new england winter
if i can’t see my breath
am i really breathing?

morning commute
day after day
the same crushed coffee cup

boston merge
horns drown out
the swearing motorist

suburban rush hour
a skunk
crosses main street

i think we’re alone now
now what do we do?

closing time
my new best friend
the barstool

the bottom
of a shot glass
the emptiness

spring training begins
but the snow shovel
remains on deck

two a.m.
my second wind
just blew away

watching tv with my parents
the silence
during condom commercials

naples pier
a wind surfer crashes
to wild applause

empty ferris wheel
i remember
our last kiss

between t stops
i lose another game of chess
to my palm pilot

march madness
walking into snowfall
instead of spring

the paraplegic
can he feel
my stare?

first day of spring
my baseball bat
behind snow shovels

winter solstice
how slowly my father
gets up from his chair

drum solo
the appetizers arrive
iced cold

warming trend
fresh rivlets
in the mud

restless night
the dog and i
exchange sighs

wide awake
the dog’s warm breath
in my ear

last day of march
waiting for the mud
to be grass again

extra credit
she leaves the teacher an apple
and her phone number

sunrise
between each car
of a passing freight train

the red sox win
and the yankees lose
i smell cherry blossoms

driving to college
my son sleeps
through delaware

central pennsylvania
the scenic view
between billboards

washington gridlock hip hop merges
with heavy metal

college visit dogwoods almost ready
to blossom

unable to sleep
unable to stay awake
a distant freight train

restless night
the dog keeps chasing the cat
in her dreams

overcast
through scratched plexiglas
is still overcast

april 15th
now i know the meaning
of give the devil his due

a homeless veteran
sleeps peacefully
on yesterday’s war headline

her perfume
the breath
of my daydream

so light in my hand
i imagine him flying
the dead sparrow

summer heat
my dog becomes a throw rug
on the bathroom floor

clear skies
too chilly
for stargazing

marathon monday
i’m tired
just thinking about it

a beautiful day
or so it would seem
from my webcam

spring in the air sneezing fits
in full bloom

after the fight
our next door neighbors’
loud lovemaking

new moon
the red sox sweep the yankees
in new york

first day
on the new job slow steady rain

pre-dawn lovemaking
tulip blossoms
fill with dew

my daughter turns twenty-one
a seagull flies into the sun

not a single cloud
reflected in the puddle
from last night’s rain

commuting to the new job
lone crow
perched on a power line

class dismissed
rats flee
from the dumpster

cracks in the pint glass
a pub regular
catches my ear

pulling up weeds
i covet
my neighbor’s lilacs

at long last spring
i thought i would never see
her legs again

morning meditation
her lips caressing
each om

morning meditation
i strain to hear
her mantra

overnight rain
the last of my mother’s siblings
passes on

catching our breaths
in the afterglow
a faucet drips

in tuesday’s trash
the sign god hates fags
and two dozen roses

waiting for the late train
pigeons peck
the freshly swept floor

spring heat
a bead of sweat
clings to her nipple

crowded subway car
whose newspaper
shall i read today?

memorial day party
mother robin
stays close to her nest

crowded subway car
the man sitting next to me
reads some like it hot

darkening skies
the sidewalk littered
with lottery tickets

blue moon
the fullness
of her lips

heat wave
strangers argue
over a parking spot

waiting for the red line
ivy encircles
the third rail

sitting on a park bench
how can this little sparrow
want my whole sandwich?

father’s day
my son asks for an advance
on his allowance

found
in a stack
of unpaid bills
the father’s day card
i never sent

heavy sigh
the 709 train
right on time

four days into the diet
my stomach growls
at the dog

blue moon
a shopping cart
in the train yard

boston rush hour a muffler scrapes
against the asphalt

looking for a gas station
i tell my son
it’s dad, not dude

last day of the diet
an empty take-out carton
on the side of the road

asleep on the train
a raspberry hazelnut coffee
sits next to me

end of the month
today i really have
no spare change

the beggar curses
a seagull
among pigeons

crowded train
i lose another game
of solitaire

independence day
the rockets’ red glare
over boston gridlock

rain delay
two young fans gaze
at an empty field

morning commute recognizing a co-worker
i pretend to sleep

distant thunder
dead mosquitoes
in the bird bath

dusk
fireflies
in the backyard

independence day
a chained dog
barks at fireworks

silent crows
my daughter asks
to borrow the car

midnight thirst
thinking water
but feeling beer

turbulence
a screaming baby

amateur night
a price tag
on the singer’s shoes

in the heat of day
a dog sleeps
on the bathroom tile

slow dance
imagining myself
inside her

guilty pleasure
when nobody’s looking
i google myself

shortcut
through a cemetery
my footsteps echo

dancing alone
the jukebox plays
i want you to want me

trimming the hedges
a wasp nest
discovers me

midnight
but the day has just begun
for the mosquito

internet down
i get a paper cut
reading the comics

new england highway
a skunk carcass
flatter than yesterday

blue moon
the silence
of fog

dog days
the dog
dazed

sun mixed with clouds
a homeless man’s
brand new shoes

dawn approaches the mosquito becomes
a passing truck

downtown crossing
an old man talks to pigeons
about jesus

i’m a believer
the arrow in her belly button
points to paradise

pay day
the homeless man
turns down his walkman

last day of summer
fog settles
above the treetops

a pretty girl!
my chick magnet
squats

first frost
my father speaks of himself
in the past tense

late summer chill
the deer crossing sign
riddled with bullets

at dockside
more gulls
than slices of bread

first date
he tries to hide the condom
in his wallet

slow blues
a bead of sweat
that just won’t fall

heat wave
in an act of kindness
i mentally undress her

first day of school
a hornet’s nest
at the bus stop

september rain
three college
tuition bills

entering the courthouse
security confiscates
my coffee

central square
the prostitute doesn’t ask me
for a light

crowded elevator
the aspiring executive
wears too much cologne

september chill
my tires barely miss
the gray squirrel

cambridge brewpub
a man reading freud
strokes his pint glass

making love
in an old boxcar
the train kept a rollin’

my daughter turns twenty
a squirrel drops a quince
from a tall branch

september
each morning
a little darker

the old dog
a leaf falls
unnoticed

my brother turns 41
will my belated birthday card
arrive on time?

unable to sleep
an apple branch
against the window

my youngest son
wild flowers
among the weeds

stalled elevator
the unmistakable fragrance
of eternity

a cell phone rings
the drunk sitting next to me
answers his beer

pub regular
his expertise grows
by the pint

cancelled train
the extra sleep
i missed

before the dog
realizes what we’re doing
i come

september
a chipmunk returns to the hole
i filled yesterday

behind schedule
i run for the 709
so that i can sleep

fall colors
the college freshman’s
fuschia hair

restless night
the whistle
of a faraway train

seeing my breath
is better than
not seeing my breath

looking for something fresh
a skunk
climbs out of the dumpster

full of wine
i imagine her face
when she comes

full moon
i stop myself
from kissing her

family court
my wedding band
sets off the metal detector

threat of frost
my exwife
enters the court room

late for the train
a stranger shakes my hand
and asks for my vote

smiling at someone else
the stranger shakes my hand
and asks for my vote

fall colors
my youngest son’s
deep voice

playoffs at fenway
the squirrel peels
another quince

back bay
a flock of pigeons
in unison

high-tension wire
a crow calls
to itself

october chill
she doesn’t remember
saying hello to me

columbus day
a telephone rings
in an empty phone booth

autumn wind
even though
the flag hangs limp
i can feel it

the playoffs begin
a ripe quince falls
between two squirrels

winter rain
even the dog
stays under the umbrella

heavy sigh
headlights reflected
in the rain-soaked pavement

morning commute
a freshly spun
spider web

the morning after
zoot suit riot
sleeps in the park

rain out
one more day to dream
in october

playoff game seven
i refuse to wear
my winter jacket

lunar eclipse over fenway
an old man weeps with joy

leaves turn from gold to brown
i bury the dead puppies

crowded subway car
the androgynous woman
doesn’t want my seat

stalled subway car
making faces
at the crying baby

late for the bus
the sour-faced girl’s t-shirt
reads angel

the day of the dead
our nation
elects a president

burning leaves
kerry concedes
the election

election wednesday
a homeless man sleeps
on campaign posters

guarding a suburban home
an eighteen inch statue
of the virgin mary

frost on the windshield
i remember my son’s
first steps

red light district
working girls
share a cigarette

november
snow falls
on unraked leaves

november snow
now i remember
to rake the leaves

first snow
the treacherous search
for a snow shovel

lonely highway
sparks from a cigarette
follow the truck

waking from a dream
i cheer
my son’s touchdown

snowy night
my son scores another touchdown
in my dreams

why rake leaves
when i can write this haiku
about raking leaves?

late november
chasing a fat squirrel
away from the pumpkin

crowded subway car
she moves
closer

open window
fresh air and hip hop
fill the room

after a long illness
the same brown leaves
in the backyard

hunter’s moon
the dog paces
back and forth

my son asks
to borrow my gloves

view from our kitchen window
a sky filled with stars
and the dog’s nose print

luxury apartments

what’s so interesting
about my shoes?

end of a long night
i hug my new best friend
the barstool

graceland
a racquetball court filled
with empty elvis suits

pulling in to south station
i finally win
at solitaire

breathless
she climbs the stairs
in a tight black dress

tossing and turning
another dog toy
falls from the bed

the wayside inn
a flame flickers
in the fake fireplace

a whisper
between two lovers

whispering
about my father’s illness
his blank stare

in tomorrow’s snowstorm

right where i left it

my silver hair

longest day
the sign in big black letters reads
lost cat

the dow drops
i pick up a penny
from the sidewalk

dark clouds
the thunderous cries
of crows

the early train
a sparrow hops
along the platform

morning haze
an unmatched pair of socks

crowded train
her body language
foul

moonless night
trying to remember
the last time we made love

midnight
how do i not reply to you
in a haiku?

broken clouds
my portfolio
vanishes

ocean daydream
shimmering waves
above the asphalt

crowded train
i compare pedicures

standing room only
her hot pink
red sox cap

august rain
my new granddaughter’s
tiny fingers

august
the red savinas
swelter

summer chill - she doesn’t
recognize me

cicadas
my new grandson’s
tiny heartbeat

twilight
the hair on my arms
turning gray

sunrise
her fingers comb
her golden hair

ten years later
there is still
a blue horizon

maybe
after the clouds break
a haiku

starry eyes
i pretend to know
the constellations

wall street headline
full moon
in a starless sky

an empty wine glass
the great gig
in the sky

pot hole on wall street
the bottom
nowhere in sight

september chill
a psychic reads
the wall street journal

a skunky beer
my favorite dive bar
without the cobwebs

church bells
condemn
my hangover

waiting for the train
a clamor
of blackberries

starless
i finally
feel fall

accelerate!
a fat gray squirrel
crosses the street

the dow plunges
the bitterness
of a 4-dollar latte

autumn
the bright red ink
in my portfolio

broken clouds
the glimmer
of golden parachutes

government bail-out
an elephant stands
on a house of cards

far from wall street
the leaves
still fall

columbus day
my short cut
a dead end

rush hour
the wail
of a harmonica

late train
i can smell
the couple’s argument

final debate
a dog stalks
a fat squirrel

the silence
that follows the snap!
of the mouse trap

gibbous moon
the defending champions
go home

early train
these college students
get younger every year

autumn overcast
nothing i want
is in these want ads

waiting for the train
a blind man
sees through me

my 401k
at least the sun
still rises

trick or treat!
a little skeleton
is afraid of me

the trees
almost bare
fresh graffiti

turning back the clock
i still feel old

election day
to shave
or not to shave?

election day
the cactus
flowers

bare trees
the marquee says
my train is cancelled

soft rain
i let the argument go

light drizzle
and still i don’t huddle
under the bridge

gibbous moon
the unblinking eyes
of a frightened dog

november wind
a pumpkin
without a face

hunter’s moon
the search
for a working pen

november overcast
i wish i hadn’t asked her
about her day

november wind
it’s a good day
when you’re still employed

the dow plummets
my axe blade
caught on a knot

still november
two christmas cards
in the mail

first frost
a new patch of new gray
in the dog’s muzzle

missing the train
the bitterness
of a premium coffee

december night
venus and jupiter
in the palm of my hand

winter morning
i turn away
from the sunlight

across the ocean
my granddaughter turns two
fair weather clouds

december rain
my broken heart

freezing rain
the ferry lists
back and forth

longest night
the drip, drip, drip
of the ice dam

heavy snow
two pigeons fight
over a cigarette butt

dusting of snow
an old photograph
at the bottom of the drawer

new year’s eve
the festive sound
of a snow plow

easter sunday
the doctor’s
cold stethoscope

maybe
after the clouds break
the words that fail me

soft rain
another unreturned phone call

easter sunday
a broken clock
in the waiting room

new year’s day
vacuuming up the needles
from the christmas tree

deep freeze
my credit card
declined

cold snap
this is not the change
i need

off night at the pub
a regular pours one
for himself

new moon
the dog
walks me

snow turns to rain
my son dressed in fatigues
on facebook

groundhog day
the search
for matching socks

summer gridlock
an old blues standard
to a hip-hop beat

used book store
a pizza stain
on who moved my cheese

why, yes, he said
to the busty waitress,
i’ll have both of them.

starless night
the bird feeders
outside the nursing home

winter thaw
autumn leaves
i never raked

deep winter
i forget the name
of the brightest star

shooting star
the dog sniffs
an empty cup

end of february
so tired
of haiku
about snow

winter chill
my son shows off
his new tattoo
on facebook

mardi gras
plastic beads
on a thrift-store mannequin

ash wednesday
cigarette butts
on the church steps

fresh snow
a sudden longing
for mud

lonely night
a crow flies
across the moon

somewhere
above the clouds
a full moon

first day of spring
my incredulous
ear muffs

sweet sixteen
a late season
snow shower

northerly wind
the weekend
is gone

the dow soars
bare branches
hiss in the wind

freshly plowed field
the minstrel’s beautiful
nightmare song

march rain
unanswered
telephone

march wind
a white plastic trash bag
stuck in a thorn bush

spring cleaning
a long lost photo
of my children

santa fe sunset
extra salt on the rim
of my margarita

crescent moon
the song i can’t get
out of my head

april fool
i peek at my
retirement portfolio

full moon
i forget
everything else

april moon
the dog’s loud
contented yawn

friday night
a throbbing bass
rounds the corner

finally spring
the sweetness
of an old cigar

april overcast
my son turns twenty
in iraq

april wind
a tattered flag
stiffens

dogwood blossoms
i remember
my first love

the market rallies
a tick
on my dog’s face

may day
the dog protests
a shiny new collar

a strong ale
the rain
that never came

mother’s day
a full moon
framed by clouds

shooting star
where the weeping willow
used to be

moonless night
the deep croak
of a bull frog

memorial day
a holiday i hope
not to celebrate

june overcast
television flickers
in the nursing home

hours before
the vieques sunrise
a rooster crows

father’s day
walking the dog
in the rain

last day of june
moss on the north side
of a tombstone

restless sleep
the sound of footsteps
on the moon

total eclipse
i forget
the question

summer rain
a saw horse
abandoned

somewhere above
these relentless clouds
a full moon

rain delay
the dog
paces

august overcast
another son
gone to war

end of summer
sparks from a cigarette
dancing at the curb

voicemail from the ex
a dead skunk
in a busy intersection

september sun
a dragonfly rests
on a sunflower petal

autumn
a long glance
at my hawaiian shirt

last day of summer
a half-ripened
habanero

midnight rain
the dog settles in
between us

end of summer
his on-line haiku gallery
now a porn site

full moon
the silence
of all my children

moonrise
the haiku
i can’t seem to write

yard sale
my old belt fitting
someone else

october
the wind shifts
from fan to humidifier

frost warning
the red sox season
comes to an end

october snow
the silence
between cigarettes

first snowfall
the lawnmower
sighs

clinging
to my red sox cap
october snow

autumn rain
the warmth of one too many
glasses of wine

leaves swirling
above the landfill
thank you for recycling

a blue balloon
jumping in the wind
it’s a boy

twilight
nyquil
turns to dayquil

a deep sigh
my toast falls
buttered-side up

november
walking the dog
the windshields glaze over

veteran’s day
another letter addressed
to parris island

walking the dog
in the rain

writer’s block
a field mouse
struggling in the trap

thanksgiving night
a stray dog
in an empty parking lot

wolf moon
the dog’s
far-away eyes

december rain
a phone call
from my son

december sunrise
dogwood berries cling
to a snow-covered branch

longest night
the echo
of my sigh

bitter cold
even the christmas lights
seem to shiver

christmas eve
the empty nursing home
parking lot

last day of the year
a box of munchkins
in an empty conference room

a broken beer bottle
where the weeping willow
used to be

june overcast
something scurrying
across the road

a text message
i wish i hadn’t read
full moon

end of summer
a dead skunk
in a busy intersection

full moon
a love embrace
disintegrates into laughter

the dog barks
at a falling leaf

into the fire

the dog’s eyes
far away

a pile of
torn lottery tickets

my grandson’s eyes
where the weeping willow
used to be

a cross in the median
of a busy highway

a red strobe light
in her bedroom window

december rain
the dog sniffs
a plastic bag

where the weeping willow
used to be

veteran’s day
a fly trapped
behind the storm window

december rain
a deer tail
and then nothing

veteran’s day
a bird’s nest
in the tallest tree

december rain
enough junk mail
to start a fire

blue moon
i wonder where my children
are tonight?

first monday of the year
already too late
for resolutions

blue moon
she wears a wry smile
and nothing else

snow turns to rain
pitchers and catchers report
in thirty days

restless night
snowmelt trickles
down the window

gibbous moon
i’m almost ready
to fall asleep

wolf moon
the dog won’t
come in

wolf moon
i wonder what my dog
sees in me

ground hog day
a head peeks out
from a cubicle

moonless night
an ambulance speeds by
with its lights out

too wired to sleep
too tired to dream
winter wind

snow in the forecast
the dog twitches
in its sleep

late to bed
my pillow
a snoring dog

snowmelt
muddy paw prints
on my pillow

cactus flower
a sudden craving
for a margarita

sunset
exactly the color
of my next beer

crowded train
her perfect lips
pierced

winter wind
the dog shivers
in its sleep

full moon
if not
for these clouds

going out of business
the naked mannequin’s
mardi gras beads

partly cloudy
my dad answers the question
he thought i asked

7th inning stretch
a vulture circles
overhead

tropical sun
a wild horse
unafraid of my horn

after the rain
the tiniest puddle
in my wine glass

overcast
the spider doesn’t know
it’s cheap wine

sleeping in
the dog chases you
out of my dream

date winding down
i make up the name
of that star

weeping cherry blossoms
a late-season snow shower

moving day
a photo of the ex
worn around the edges

slow steady drizzle
i didn’t hear
your question

cold april rain
and it’s only
tuesday

may flowers
my granddaughters’
matching dresses

may frost
even my eyebrows
are turning gray

restless morning
what is that mockingbird saying?

finally friday
the dog so attentive
around the grill

swarm of gnats
a harmonica solo
from a scratchy lp

gibbous moon
our dog doesn’t know
it’s her birthday

memorial day
stars obscured
by distant smoke

june sunshine
the cop lets me off
with a warning

june haze
the dog ignores
a taunting squirrel

june cold snap
the next-door neighbor’s
house for sale

after the rain
a light on in the basement
of an empty house

hot summer night
the dog’s breath
against my leg

morning haze
one light rinse of the coffee cup
is good enough

stifling heat
our new neighbors’
argument

heat wave
the dog moves slowly
from shadow to shadow

restless night
the old dog twitching
in our bed

on her balcony
a beautiful bouquet
i’d love to toss

sudden chill
an empty bird feeder
outside the nursing home

waning moon
a hand-printed sign reads
lost dog

a scar in the ground
where the old oak
used to be

blue dragonfly
do you bring me news
or are you just being?

high-tension wire
crows
answer the thunder

restless night
was that thunder
or a passing train?

a break in the heat
the cop lets me off
with a warning

faded and brittle
the autograph of a prospect
who never made it

shooting star
trying to remember
her name

shooting star
speeding past
my exit

not a cloud in the sky
the state trooper’s smile
as he hands me a ticket

burlington harbor
two empty party boats
pass in the rain

slow steady rain
a limp
i hadn’t noticed before

neighborhood dive bar
the barmaid’s faded
rose tattoo

my exwife’s name

my baseball glove
right where i left it

for a fraction of a second
i’m flying

i’ve lost

still a mathematical
possibility

red sox fans
put away their caps

the tattooed lady
everywhere

pitchers and catchers report
in 132 days

her cobra tattoo
i ask her
if she bites

autumn drizzle
an apple cider cocktail
on the rocks

an abandoned car
on lover’s lane

is the lighthouse beacon
searching
for the new moon?

new moon
the mouse in the ceiling
awakens

october
the dog and i
exchange sighs

the plane’s approach
so many glittering
baseball diamonds

full moon
beyond the clouds
the yankees go home

district court
the judge pronounces my last name
perfectly

back to work
a cell phone rings
in an adjacent stall

warm autumn wind
yes, i’m thinking
of her tonight

cloudless autumn night
she never gave me
the right time of day

my life’s dilemma
how can i be my dog
and still write haiku?

raw autumn day
an extra portion
of hot sauce

first date
she pretends to like
the opening band

snow in the forecast
the white
in my dog’s muzzle

miserable day
your words
and all this rain

more rain
a mouse trapped
between walls

after the rain
the hum
of afternoon traffic

veteran’s day
a murder of crows
at ease

overcast
just one more game
of solitaire

a break in the clouds
my third cup of coffee
grows cold

clear skies
my hair so much darker
in an old photo

clear skies
a solitary crow
on a high-voltage wire

november sky
i used to remember
which planet that was

gibbous moon
beyond the clouds
my unreturned calls

thanksgiving night
too full to sleep
too tired to move

bare branches
filled with crows

black friday
a sudden craving
for chocolate stout

the season’s first
christmas card

do the streetlights know
how early it is?

an abandoned crow’s nest

cyber monday
a wireless mouse
in the pantry

last day of november
i surrender
to solitaire

last day of november
the white noise lullaby
of the turnpike

winter clouds
my gray hair
grayer

first of december
the darkness
before dawn

first of december
police tape clinging
to a burned-out barn

first of december
another cold cup
of coffee

december rain
and here i thought
we were friends

new moon
my eldest grandchild
turns four

a second cocktail
the faux tin ceiling
of a remodeled speakeasy

hipster pub
the maitre d’s
ironic mustache

lazy midtown morning
another layer of paint
on the rusty fire escape

just outside new haven
the junkers piled
three high

new london winter
the gleam of pleasure boats
wrapped in plastic

now reaching top speed
the conductor reminds us
to read the safety card

a shredded plastic bag
in barb wire

single-digit temperatures
a phone call
from the ex

snow flurries
the crackle
of an old 78

the long night
longer

another log
for the fire

a late friend’s
facebook page

an exgirlfriend
wants to friend me

every footprint

eighteen hours later
three to four inches
of mostly cloud

winter solstice
i leave my eldest son
a voicemail

footprints in the snow
words
i can’t take back

snow flurries
last night’s tequila
lingering in my head

bad coffee
the buzz
of a fluorescent light

two days into winter
already tired
of shoveling snow

christmas eve
i void another
laptop warranty

christmas day
50 days until
pitchers and catchers report

a christmas miracle!
the empty shopping mall
parking lot

winter whiteout
the flashbulb’s reflection
in my hair

end of the holiday weekend
the sound
of the snow plow

christmas cocktail
the children build an igloo
in an old photograph

snow day
more white than i remember
in my beard

restless night
somewhere
an ice dam

restless night
the kiss
that never was

restless morning
the winter fly
comes back to life

new year’s eve
the nursing home’s
empty parking lot

moonless night
an empty can
of whipped cream

cold april rain
the dog sniffs
everything

may frost
i’m sure she heard me
say hello

restless night
a tree frog
in and out of tune

waning moon
i catch my breath
at the top of the stairs

storm in the forecast
i balance my checkbook

new moon
a missing
mouse trap

snow in the forecast
tapping my foot
to a sad song

after the rain
an oldtimer flirts
with a new employee

fair weather clouds
above the bare treetops

moonless night
a pale of dirty snow
in the empty parking lot

why do i
live here?

i know i’m forgetting
something

back and forth

the warmth
of a familiar song

cold april rain
i no longer remember
your name

my dream
interrupted

my daughter’s birthday
on another continent

cold april rain
the sediment
at the bottom
of a wine glass

new year’s day
the dog resolves
not to move

new year’s day
stroking the hair
of the dog that bit me

winter fog
if only i could be
as still

in the waiting room
a christmas tree
without lights

holidays over
the brook slows
to a trickle

winter thaw
taking down
the christmas lights

moonless night
to have died
so young

mourning
a name
for every cloud

long weekend over
the morning much darker
than i’d remembered

restless night
the spaces
between the silence

bitter cold
i cut myself shaving

epiphany
christmas trees
piled up on the sidewalk

winter dusk
dark circles
under my eyes

rumors of deployment
a log pops
in the fire

recurring dream
waking up on a train
in a strange town

moonless night
i never know
what to say

moonless night
a child’s bicycle
in the snow

snowmelt
the dog sniffs
everything

snow flurries
a red squirrel
that didn’t make it

after the snow
the oak and i
perfectly still

snow on the way
my shot glass
runneth over

snow on the way
the dog
makes herself comfortable

stiff and withered
the habanero plant
and me

how quickly
it fades
winter sun

winter sky
my grandson’s
blue eyes

winter dusk
the hawk pretends
not to see me

winter twilight
a ladybug
lands on the wood stove

winter twilight
i don’t remember ever
being that young

snow in the forecast
a bit more gray
in the dog’s muzzle

snow emergency
we’ve finished
the last beer

deep snow
i don’t remember
her name

regrets
an approaching
snowplow

blowing snow
the dog backs away
from the open door

exhausted from shoveling
my restless dreams
of baseball

winter dog walk
my bones are screaming
and only i can hear it

winter angst
the crunch of road salt
beneath my feet

moving day
all the books
i never read

ice dam
i can’t stop
thinking about her

sunset
a snow angel
full of shadows

covered with snow
it’s new again
the rusty caboose

snowmelt
can the next storm
be far away?

snow in the forecast
snow on the ground
a murder of crows

snow turns to rain
a familiar name
in the obituary

winter jungle
the roar
of the snow plow

snow turns to rain
25 days
until pitchers and catchers report

wolf moon
the dog twitches
in her sleep

snow mixed with rain
she tells me i look good
for my age

black ice
a skip
in my favorite record

black ice
alone on the train
of my dreams

black ice
i startle
from a deep sleep

christmas cactus
because i’m tired
of writing haiku
about snow

blowing snow
she loves me
she loves me not

ice dam
i lose another game
of solitaire

too tired to sleep
too tired to stay awake
winter silence

snowbound
the dog wonders why
i can’t make it warm

minus five
another bad coffee please

minus five
the dog pretends
to be asleep

bitter cold
a dream
about the ex

state of the union
she finishes
my sentence

watching the radar
this beer
isn’t strong enough

state of the union
the dog herds me
toward the door

state of the union
not enough blanket
for the two of us

storm approaching
the boss wants
a word with me

snowbound
the crows cry
we’re here! we’re here!

winter sky
the perfect canvas
for my daydream

writer’s block
fresh footprints
in the snow

fresh snow
my pale winter tan

ice dams
if the cactus
could speak

writer’s block
the ice dam
slows to a trickle

winter wind
the muted rumble
of the clothes dryer

dirty snow
news of a friend
in the icu

dirty snow
my uninsured friend
in search of a hospital

dirty snow
his name tattooed
on her neck

dirty snow
your hometown could be
the next big thing

dirty snow
your email
in my spam folder

dirty snow
one more beer
than i needed

snowbound
even my daydreams
fade to white

snowmelt
i finally win
at solitaire

waking from a nightmare
the drip drip drip
of an ice dam

approaching storm
a distant
car alarm

a dozen roses
i love you - and not only because
you’re not snow

between storms
pitchers and catchers report
in twelve days

ground hog day
my kingdom
for a shadow

stuck in a snow bank
my next-door neighbor’s
high-priced convertible

more snow
nobody notices
my two-day stubble

fighting the cold
a hawaiian shirt
beneath my parka

year of the rabbit
an extra skip
in my step

dive bar
a silent toast
to not being recognized

sirens
a child’s bicycle
in the snow bank

dead of winter
a squirrel
at the hummingbird feeder

dead of winter
stepping over the dog
to tend the fire

super bowl sunday
the dog snores
on the couch

winter sunshine
the pause between sips
of a barleywine

my new favorite song
snowmelt gurgling
in the gutters

winter thaw
the sway
of her hips

fresh jambalaya
when i close my eyes
the snow is gone

crowded elevator
an epic battle
of perfumes

winter rain
another glance at the watch
i’m not wearing

bitter cold
news that my father
is out of surgery

summer in brooklyn
i water the plants
on the fire escape

just visiting
a crowd of bobble-heads
watch me pee

bitter cold
an eighteen-wheeler
hits a pothole

jury duty
those on time
are left out in the cold

in the waiting room
a disheveled woman
reads glamour magazine

old photograph
my eyes
stare back at me

windless night
a fish swims
through the moon

crowded subway car
i try to match the face
to the patchouli oil

paper clip
barely able
to hold it together

dirty snow
our next-door neighbor’s
mail order wife

waiting for her call
i stare
at thunderclouds

winter clouds
the dog
goes back to bed

staring at
a blank canvas
winter clouds

winter thaw
a strong barleywine
at room temperature

scent of roses
when you kiss me
the snow is gone

dreamless sleep
a towering pile
of dirty snow

plum blossom
i have to look it up
online

sleepless night
a house fly trapped
between window panes

somewhere
under all these scarves
my baseball glove

out of breath
full moon
obscured by clouds

full moon
the dog snores
with eyes wide open

winter thunder
this time
without the snowplow

winter wind
a secret i wish
i never knew

a week before payday
i write out a check
with red ink

their faces seem so familiar
the grandchildren
i’ve yet to meet

fresh snow
my marine son signs up
for another four years

always stalking me
while i sleep
paper tiger

rock, paper, scissors
who walks the dog
on this frigid night?

tattooed to her wrist
the perfect rose

i hear them
in my dreams
harbor bells

winter mud
i’ll sip this barleywine
instead

harbor mist
whispering
all my secrets

snow turns to rain
is my hair
really that gray?

the might lion
safe and sound
under baby’s blanket

winter rain
nobody notices
that i haven’t shaved

the mighty lion
safe and sound
under baby’s blanket

departure lounge
is that our pilot
stifling a yawn?

spring break
how come i
was never that young?

tropical night
the low rider’s
throbbing bass

seaside dining
the blackbird
snatches a fly

wake-up call
the taxi toots its horn
at the top of the hill

our last full day
what i wouldn’t trade
for this trade wind

beachside bar
drinking
it all in

taxiing to the runway
the pilot skillfully avoids
the baby goats

first night back
i pretend the dog’s snoring
is the ocean

tropical sunset
my thoughts
an infinite horizon

lower bay lights
a giant cruise ship
exits the harbor

tropical night
somewhere in the distance
a howling dog

where are we?
elvis plays as time goes by
on the steel drum

twilight
a lizard perched
on an aloe leaf

tropical rain
the mourning doves
silent

after the rain
a mist
of mosquitoes

lower bay
a man named messenger
brings me a beer

about hot sauce
the taxi driver says
nothing tastes right without it

ex-pat cover band
do they know that guantanamera
is a protest song?

as if i had to ask
the peppers in this hot sauce
are rasta peppers

writer’s block
a mud puddle
ices over

fat tuesday
i sneer
at my lean cuisine

heavy sigh
the dog snoring
on my pillow

regrets
a towering pile
of dirty snow

dirty snow
a secret
i wish she’d kept

overcast
nobody cares
that i’m not clean-shaven

winter fog
the absence
of crickets

the old pond
bulldozed
to make way
for condos

a moment of silence
our lives
drifting on a reed

daylight savings time
a child’s balloon
above the clouds

the stock market plummets
moonlight
over the ruined castle

my granddaughters
in matching dresses
crocuses in bloom

nightmare
where my city
used to be

the ides of march
whispers
in a nearby cubicle

island cuisine
i google the ingredients
of last night’s dinner

winter rain
the glow of my vacation
washed away

after the rain
a thoughtful glance
at my watch

after the rain
i remember
her eyes

winter fog
the flag
hangs limply

st. patrick’s day
a little hot sauce
on my shepherd’s pie

march madness
the cascade
of a freshly poured guinness

my dublin daydream
yes i said yes i will yes

i daydreamed all day
about continuing
last night’s dream

unseasonably warm
wild flowers blossom
in my daydreams

warming trend
her neckline
deepens

wolf moon
the faraway look
in my dog’s eyes

blind date
an irresistible urge
to text

civil unrest
another grandchild
on the way

spring snow
waving to my youngest grandchild
on skype

spring snow
clearing off the windshield
with my baseball glove

spring snow
the cactus
is unmoved

spring snow
all the projects
i’ve never finished

spring snow
i stare at my footprints
and sigh

spring snow
the dog doesn’t
understand

snow in the forecast
i check on the weather
somewhere else

snow squall
the crows are almost as alarmed
as i am

lying in a hammock
in the beachfront villa
of my dreams

spring cleaning
a strand of hair
from an exgirlfriend

spring snow
an empty carton
of marlboro lights

at long last friday
a red-tailed hawk
rides the breeze

puppy love
a soggy chew toy
on my pillow

doctor’s visit
the radio plays
knockin’ on heaven’s door

moments before
the alarm clock rings
a distant train

march sunshine
a housefly trapped
between window panes

march madness
like january
without the snow

more war talk
dry branches
rattle in the wind

my son re-enlists
the crows
are silent

recruitment office
a mouse sniffs the walnut
in a trap

budget showdown
two crows fight
over a dead mouse

defending the war
a male pigeon
puffs out his chest feathers

new moon
an abandoned car
on lover’s lane

crescent moon
she asks
if i want to park

crescent moon
neither of us wants
to say goodbye

mass pike gridlock
hip-hop merges
with heavy metal

lower bay
sunbathers
compare tattoos

the harbor at night
two empty party boats
pass in the rain

snow in the forecast
what’s left of my suntan
fades

spring snow
a sagging string
of christmas lights

april snow
who said
we won’t get fooled again?

play ball!
the dog races me
to the door

calling me sugar
the waitress serves my coffee
black

calling me sugar
the waitress serves me
black coffee

viewing my portfolio
a spider spins its web

april thunderstorm
a toast
to the underdogs

april dusk
not quite the answer
i was looking for

dusk
a disabled train
between stations

after the storm
a conversation
among crows

darkening night
i used to remember
what planet that was

partly cloudy
the nurse tells me
i have nice veins

happy hour ends
the story
of my life

snow white
my first visit
to the beach

fog
the rise and fall
of my ekg

spring in the air
she lets her hair down
for no one in particular

rumble of thunder
the dog
makes a strange sound

finally spring
a half-ripened
habanero

out of change
the street musician plays
my favorite song

another beer
far better
than the opening band

missing my train
the sax player shifts
to a minor key

encore!
he shoots the crowd
with his guitar

done with homework
i study
the librarian

moving day
all the books
i’ve yet to read

new moon
alone
in a king-sized bed

after promising
to have only one
i order a double

moonrise
a giant cruise ship
enters the harbor

restless night
the dog keeps chasing you
from my dreams

aching joints
the dow stumbles
and falls

sleepless night
a continuum
of gray

it’s a girl!
a pink balloon
dancing in the wind

april showers
a puddle as deep
as the national debt

dry river bed
the tree frogs
in my dreams

gibbous moon
the sparkle
in the dog’s eyes

overflowing
the box labeled
miscellaneous

recurring nightmare
a flag-draped coffin
bearing my last name

april dusk
a red-tailed hawk
pretends not to see me

mid-april
still so many tree branches
without words

walking to your house
wildflowers
in bloom

palm sunday
the sandy beaches
of my dreams

a break in the clouds
the full moon
and you

marathon monday
a sprint
to silence the alarm

starless night
another message
with no reply

the dog sleeps
the drunks howl
swordfishtrombones

the politician’s speech
dead tree branches
rattle in the wind

sudden breeze
yesterday’s headline
crosses the street

climbing the walls
after three days of rain
wisteria

daydreaming about retirement
i hit a pot hole
on wall street

glaring at me
in the mirror
my bloodshot eyes

earth day
the last of her letters
in the recycle bin

earth day
a dirty paw print
on my pillow

earth day
the dog digs up
an old bone

kissing me
ingrid bergman’s lips
on an old movie poster

glorious morning
all the pretty easter dresses
standing in a row

glorious morning
an inflatable easter bunny
dancing in the breeze

easter dinner
grandma keeps staring
at the waitress’ nose ring

monday morning
a skunk
crosses main street

a skunk
crosses main street
insert punchline here

a recent photo
i even look gray
in black-and-white

april fog
a broken swing
in an empty playground

april fog
a cigarette smolders
beneath the see-saw

overcast
the distant cry
of a hawk

overcast night
the distant cry
of a hawk

light drizzle
what we
nearly lost

in the waiting room
a fake flame
in the fake fireplace

fresh paint
fresh paw prints
on the back door

exxon’s profits soar
bare tree branches
hiss in the wind

royal wedding
a mourning dove
puffs out its chest feathers

fireflies
where the weeping willow
used to be

over coffee
my mother lays out
the morning pills

a hug
from my granddaughters
forsythias in bloom

father and son
at the ballpark
not a cloud in sight

soaring above
the right field fence
a red-tailed hawk

unable to sleep
my daughter wants proof
that the boogeyman is dead

baby’s breath
all that’s left
of her wedding bouquet

broken clouds
my granddaughter tells me
she has to go potty

rain in the forecast
one final day
with the grandchildren

light drizzle
a kiss from the granddaughter
i’ve just met

light rain
a heavy sigh

recycle bin
yesterday’s news
no better than today’s

steampunk festival
a girl with butterfly wings
cuts me in line

mother’s day miracle
i’m the first son
to call

a truck backfires
escaping the gunshots
of my dreams

their first train ride
the wind
between the raindrops

extra innings
my second wind
throws me a curve ball

low tide
seagulls squabbling
over trash

light drizzle
the dog still wants
to be walked

old house
putting back
a displaced cobweb

her long legs
i walk right into
a spider web

inchworm
i measure my words
carefully

spider web
i can’t take back
the words i never said

news from mexico
a shot
of tequila

june swoon
the hot dog vendor’s
flaccid franks

somewhere
in this cubicle maze
the scent of lilacs

heavy sigh
i once knew the name
of that star

cracked mirror
my granddaughter
throws a tantrum

friday the thirteenth
sunshine peeking
through the blinds

friday the thirteenth
a black cat
crosses wall street

friday the thirteenth
a withered bouquet
in the trash

friday the thirteenth
the killer
enters hospice care

cloudless night
doesn’t the dog know
it’s a close game?

boston gridlock
honking geese
overhead

overcast
no one is answering
the phone

sleight of hand
i balance
the checkbook

independence day
her new nightgown
falls to the ground

trying hard to smile
her significant other
is a woman

the boss’s new toupee
i have a right
to remain silent

twilight mist
the dog snores
at our feet

midnight rain
the taste
of your lips

somewhere
above these clouds
full moon

smog moon
i’m not shouting
she shouts

new moon
her significant other
is a woman

rain out
the long
subway ride home

rain out
the dog
doesn’t care

may fog
a dream
i didn’t want to end

may fog
wall street
opens flat

surrounded
by freckles
her tribal tattoo

crowded train
a blind man’s dog
stares at me

mist turns to rain
a daydream
washed away

recurring nightmare
a game of solitaire
i always win

a break in the rain
time for
a new excuse

light drizzle
at least one of us
is fast asleep

overcast
the loud silence
of the wind chimes

peace at last
with one blow
of the fly swatter

dirty blues
the guitarist’s
pork- pie hat

end of the weekend
the dog lies down
in freshly-mowed grass

late night dog walk
the tension
at the end of the leash

a break in the clouds
the pit bull smiles
from ear to ear

overcast sky
a notebook filled
with blank pages

old cemetery
a woman wipes the dew
from a tombstone

bright sunshine
the dog’s
birthday tiara

restless night
a slow-moving
freight train

just like that
fireflies

end of spring
egrets posing
for the dusk

morning mist
the song
of the tree frog

dog walk
the poison
of a perfect lawn

overcast
a bridge
i’ve yet to cross

memorial day
so much i need
to forget

seafood shack
a crab leg
the size of my hangover

memorial day
so many things
i want to forget

memorial day
so many things
i’d rather forget

distant thunder
i remember a dream
from long ago

storm on the horizon
her sundress
still shines

ominous skies
the dow plunges

following the dow
only my blood pleasure
rises

cloudless sky
a hawk perched
on a satellite dish

brisk june morning
a deer
in the front yard

did the movie star
just smile at me?
or was she acting?

washington square statue
no match
for pigeons

a sudden chill
the look on our faces
when the north tower fell

walkabout
the glow of a cigarette
in the alley way

now i’ve seen it all
a blue heeler
named haiku

peace abbey
emily the cow’s
gentle eyes

a friendly smile
the season’s
first firefly

heat lightning
the dog’s eyes
widen

hailing a taxi
the face that launched
a thousand ships

glass of wine

around street puddles

pulling a tick
from the dog’s fur

in perfect rhythm

and tattered
flag

abandoned
on the j train
a broken rose

full moon
orderlies draw the curtain
at the nursing home

glaring streetlight
a cloud
of gnats

after the storm
the silence
between street puddles

minor league game
father and son
discuss prospects

snow on the television
i surf
the web

trouble brewing
what a great name
for my new beer!

memories of the beach
still clinging
to my sandals

first day of summer
how her sundress
shines

the green monster
how it dwarfs
my dreams

lazy summer day
the conversation drifts
to baseball

june swoon
walking the dog
in the rain

rain delay
still dreaming
of a late-inning rally

in the kitchen

against a pale
new mexico sky

of a knuckleball

a rusty bridge
barely holding it
together

reflected in
your bloodshot eyes
the boston skyline

my next daydream
somewhere
beyond the mist

new england morning
the weariness
of fog

closing my eyes
my face in the mirror
still weary

the mirror’s reflection
not what i was expecting

christmas in july
a fresh harvest
of chili peppers

windless heat
a mouse clawing
between the walls

in the southern sky

even softer
when she wears it

beautiful

summer cloudburst
but not a single puddle
in my wine glass

a break in the clouds
a robin bathes
in a rain puddle

for the love of dog

clenched tight

in the waiting room
a porcelain vase
of plastic flowers

light rain
a kiss on the cheek
from my granddaughter

after the storm
fireflies

on somebody’s radio

of a fluorescent light

waxing eloquent

in the parking lot

if these walls
could talk

someone else

from her lips

a plume of white smoke
lingers

the radio asks me
if i’m ready to retire

a bird flies into
my office window

daydreaming
of simpler days

how the market is doing

at the pesky fly

at the bottom
of a beer bottle
a doomed yellow jacket

escaping the heat
a stray dog
who wants to play

is enjoying a cigar

how thoughtful!
the man beside me
conserving bath water

parents and their cameras
at the bus stop

heavy sigh

trying not to put the cart
before the horse

in the catcher’s mitt

overhead

at the bottom
of my home brew

to recognize me

i still see
what’s no longer there

something i found
by the dumpster

one gentle wave
after another

after the rain
patches of green
between the weeds

the old dog
still running
in her dreams

dusk
a father drops off his kids
at their stepfather’s house

the day the world died
i put down my pen
and sighed

donating blood
the nervous clamor
as the names are read

not a cloud in the sky
stock futures
fall sharply

fair-weather clouds
a cold pint
with an old friend

full moon
somewhere
above these clouds

september fog

what my t-shirt says

wandering
these empty hallways
a perfume trail

to thirteen years
of extraordinary luck

my breath

in the air

all of my children
in their twenties

a night
without words

asleep on the beach
dreams
of late spring snow

i used to know the name
of that star

a distant truck horn

i’ll believe
in civil disobedience
once you clean your room

where sea
meets cloud

falls

caressing
the contours of her calf
a snake tattoo

the final game
of the season

clinching the playoffs
another week
up in the air

the morning after
the gray sky
somehow grayer

dead end
but according to the map
the road continues

dreams
of what could have been

broken clouds
make no mistake
i am the god of junk

october
moving the sandals
to the back of the closet

october
trying to find
my slippers

pale and gray
the autumn sky
and me

almost touching
your shadow
and mine

october dusk
wishing i could see
just one more firefly

october dusk
just one more
firefly

october
too late to return
the leaves to the trees

stationary front
i keep hitting
the snooze bar

ominous clouds
and not a silver lining
to be found

occupying wall street
a flock of pigeons

having climbed
the ladder of success
what next?

chilly morning
even mother sparrow
needs her caffeine

autumn night
cold apple cider
in a tall glass

not a cloud in the sky
my grandson’s
big blue eyes

the color
of this bloody mary

i accidentally discover
a hornet’s nest

for my red sox cap

in the backyard

in our conversation

i won’t watch

right on time
but always too soon

the dog’s
heavy sigh

october dusk
my five-o’clock shadow
darkens

still packing
an umbrella

mall parking lot
exchanging
the kids

evening clouds
a perfectly timed
cocktail

evening clouds
a stranger decides
not to follow me

a pair of sneakers
dangle from a wire

northern lights

in the air

trying to tell me?

watching the leaves
change color

watching the leaves
change color

searching for the perfect
cocktail recipe

the bait taken
from all the mouse traps

in the wood pile

how quickly
they grow up

october snow
a leaf exposed
by the dog’s footprint

cold wind
a secret i wish
i never knew

cold wind
whispering
about my father’s illness

a shot glass full
of pepto-bismol

all soul’s day
a dead fox
in our neighbor’s yard

day of the dead
sparks from a cigarette butt
chasing a pickup truck

thank you for calling my gray hair
premature

behind the wall

the bare branches also want
to touch the moon

the fragrance
of burning tires

one police car
after another

moonless night
a stranger
unfriends me

november dusk
a blank page
in my haiku notebook

turning back the clock
i am halfway through
one beer too many

unseasonably mild
a flock of geese
isn’t fooled

unseasonably mild
which is why
there is hot sauce

uninspired
a cloudless
afternoon

november dusk
the stock market
plunges

hunter’s moon
her dark dark eyes

presidential debate
a storm brewing
in the distance

veteran’s day
the relentless pounding
of road construction

veteran’s day
the dogwood tree’s
blood red leaves

startled from sleep
the unmanned drone
of my nightmares

the end of the day
my flesh and blood
everywhere but here

lazy sunday morning
stepping on every
sidewalk crack

in the rain

of a distant train

my heart beating to the rhythm
of the tuba player

cajun country
a well-worn bottle
of tabasco sauce

deadline approaching
the buzz
of a high-tension wire

my daughter’s due date
the old oak clinging
to a single leaf

years ago
that disdainful hair toss
might have been for me

waiting for her call
a distant airplane
flies past the moon

empty bottle in hand
i sing christmas carols
to myself

unseasonably warm
my newest granddaughter’s
tiny fingers

having never met
my grandfather
i’m happy
just to be one

meeting my grandchildren
for the first time

celebrating
the new grandchild
with a bitter ale

washington gridlock
lane closures
to the right and left

all the frozen turkeys
congress goes home
for thanksgiving

how little i care
about football

it’s all about the team
soccer moms
on their cell phones

undebatable
my disdain
for debates

baking pumpkin pie
the dog always willing
to help

a school bus parked
at the local pub

thanksgiving morning
i win a game
of solitaire

turkey trot
driving the children
from one parent to another

in the graveyard

a three-legged dog
on a dead end street

my oldest granddaughter
turns five

the possum kicks a skunk
out of its nest

explaining to my dog
why i’m walking her

williamsburg bridge
a tiny piece of me falls
into the river

christmas morning
the stillness
outside

i wonder
what the full moon thinks
about overnight construction

after the rain
a stray dog drinks
from a hubcap

ominous clouds
not asking my father
about the heart attack

after the rain
walking the dog
through the moon’s reflection

king of hearts
he meets his mistress
after the poker game

full moon
i stop
tweeting

jo’s cafe
an old man clutches his cup
and sleeps

a furtive glance
a little extra tequila
in her cocktail

lunar eclipse
condos where
the s&amp;m nightclub
once stood

gibbous moon
the dog marks
its shadow

restless night
a distant
jackhammer

late-night construction
a greek chorus
of backhoes

how it glitters
broken glass

suburban parking lot
the beat
of a different drum

december daydream
wild daisies
and you

cold front
tonight
she has a headache

a lonely hill
against a cloudless sky
wounded knee

just in time for christmas
my first head cold
of the season

peace in baghdad
a monument
to the unknown soldier

the animal shelter
overflowing
with last year’s christmas presents

winter cough
a crack
in the frozen street puddle

overnight low
feeling
the frost

home sick from work
sparrows waiting
for the ice puddles to melt

i’ve lost count
of the things
i’ve lost count of

winter solstice
my eldest son
exactly half my age

missing my kids
an inflatable santa
lies prostrate

longest night
we’ve just run out
of nyquil

long winter
the snowman wears
a red sox cap

imagining them happy
our last two christmas trees
planted in the yard

christmas eve
a last-minute purchase
of lottery tickets

christmas snow
my grandson’s
sky blue eyes

boxing day
boxing up
the christmas trash

updating my resume
would i hire myself?

december mist
what could have been

i forgot
what i was going to say
winter wind

winter wind
the bluster
of a stump speech

leaning against a crooked tombstone
the constellations in the sky

the air was soft
the stars so fine
every moment is precious

finishing my coffee
this year’s calendar
in the trash

new year’s eve
an empty whiskey bottle
slumped against the curb

believing next year will be better
i open another beer

so long ago
dancing
at the county fair

dancing with myself
it was cute
when i was two

winter dusk
taking down
the christmas lights

snow turns to rain
the afterglow
of the plow lights

snow turns to rain
words
i can’t take back

a new year
the same old me
in the mirror

new year’s day
all my resolutions
in an empty pint glass

the slightest of flurries
taking down
the christmas lights

christmas cactus
separate cards
from my brother and his ex

cactus blossoms
my grandson becomes
my facebook friend

cold snap
my boss returns
from vacation

bitter cold
a chattering
red squirrel

restless night
a squirrel gnaws the edges
of my dream

cold snap
another game
of solitaire

presidential debate
a pigeon puffs out
its chest feathers

glancing at the mirror
another
shooting star

daydreaming
about baseball
i slip on the ice

a dusting of snow
another empty beer bottle
joins the rest

fair-weather clouds
first beer
of the weekend

feast of the epiphany
i suddenly realize
it’s today

false spring
an impromptu
smartphone tutorial

warm spell
the daffodils don’t know
it’s january

full moon
the dog twitches
in its sleep

all in favor
of being
somewhere else?

winter moon
a solitary crow

full moon
the old dog’s
deep sigh

full moon
a mouse scratching
between the walls

full moon
an old woman
clutching a rosary

crowded train
an old woman
clutching a rosary

january
the gym crowded
with resolutions

green grass
even more fragrant
than the sea

staring at me
with weary eyes
my reflection

snow in the forecast
no it isn’t
too much wine

high-tension wire
one too many cups
of espresso

winter clouds
my dog doesn’t hear me
call her name

winter rain
the anniversary
of her death

hunter’s moon
something scurrying
across the road

snow mixed with rain
white wine, red wine,
but by all means
more wine!

winter mist
drinking
the silence

january wind
the violent shivering
of traffic lights

one cocktail later
my crooked grin
in a broken mirror

farmers’ market
the farmer’s daughter’s
dirty fingers

record cold
the comfort
of a good tequila

winter twilight
my gray hair
grayer

my night
the dog doesn’t care
how cold it is

single-digit temperatures
the dog steps back
from the open door

single-digit temperatures
the sun-soaked beach
of my daydreams

stiff winter wind
another
afternoon cocktail

all-day meeting
the buzz
of a fluorescent light

another
new year’s resolution
let sleeping dogs lie

a scar in the ground
where the weeping willow
used to be

mixed precipitation
another wall street rally
fizzles out

working late
the mud
ices over

impromptu meeting
a bird flies into
our panoramic view

impromptu meeting
i covet a stranger’s
protein bar

the dead of winter
but the color of this ale
is pure autumn

crowded bar
i spell irony
solitaire

the dead of winter
cactus flowers
in my cubicle

restless night
oncoming headlights
through the bedroom blinds

sitting across from me
at the dinner table
the perfect view

snow in the forecast
some extra spice
in the jambalya

steady snowfall
no, it’s not too early
for sangria

year of the dragon
still draggin’
my ass out of bed

tonight’s forecast
tequila sunrise

thirty minutes before boarding
a woman draws on her eyebrows

airport pat-down
why dont i believe
the skies are safer?

marco island
all painted sea shells
lead to happy hour

fair-weather clouds
my father answers the question
he thought i asked

state of the union
people still tell us
we’re cute as a couple

marco island
an ash tray
in the shape
of a manatee

not at all reassured
that my life’s work
is in the cloud

visiting my parents
the road sign reads
prison workers ahead

visiting my parents
the road sign reads
state prison ahead

finishing the wine
crescent moon
over the streetlights

counting out her pills
she describes
her neighbors’ illnesses

approaching sunset
my mother watches me read

comparing investments
buzzards circle overhead

stop me if you’ve
heard this one before
i have;
and don’t

blocking my view
of the high-rise condos
the local fauna

guitar solo
a blue heron
perfectly still

cold reality
learning that my grandfather
never mentioned his parent

another beer
crescent moon
beyond the clouds

nursing home
a fake flame
in the fake fireplace

sick day
a blurred distinction
between dayquil and nyquil

winter cold
the nagging drip
of the kitchen sink

bright winter morning
the sleeping dog’s
shallow breaths.

tuning an old guitar
songs in the key of dust

sitting next to a pregnant woman
i can’t finish my crossword puzzle

hanging curveball
i didn’t buy
enough beer

in the notebook
she gave me
not one haiku

researching my family tree
my great grandparents
perhaps not so great

a sudden gust
i lose
my train of thought

also attending
the destination wedding
wind-swept clouds

decorating
the candidate’s speech
circular logic

bone-chilling cold
an empty bottle
of tequila

nyquil nightmare
a cough
to wake the dead

choking
on the smoke rings
she made for me

primary day
staying away
from the red wine

haiku moment
my kingdom
for a pen

sleepless night
mass pike truckers
navigate the silence

between doses
of cough medicine
winter fog

unseasonably mild
checking my forehead
for fever

drifting
i dream
that i am drifting

last call
interrupting my song
on the jukebox

rethinking my tip
as he tells a regular
i’m not your friend

catfish gumbo
when i close my eyes
the snow is gone

awkward silence
not sure the tequila
was a good idea

downtown crossing
over burnt coffee
a construction project

smile
she knows she’s selling me
last night’s bagel

late for work
fresh flowers
at a roadside memorial

searching
beneath her smile
over coffee

a deep red wine
her luscious lips

waxing eloquent
winter moon

champagne
frost sparkling
in the gibbous moon

dog tired
but someone
wants to play

head bowed
against a quiet window
the past behind me

bacon in the air
i don’t care
if the chicken came first

western omelet
imagining
i’m a cowboy

super bowl victory
my grandson
masters potty training

smile!
every moment
is a portrait

super bowl sunday
followed too soon
by monday

super bowl sunday
an underwear commercial
and world peace

last of the tequila
a quiet song
at full volume

a joyous reunion
loving my favorite band
all over again

waxing full
her lips

winter overcast
a strange car
idling across the street

winter overcast
the stubble
of my unshaved face

where the cat used to sleep
an empty space
between us

so beautiful
i envy
myself

full moon
i forget what happened
on wall street today

midwinter night
my wife and i
exchange coughs

starless night
imagining life
without her

life on the rocks
my least favorite cocktail

blues jam
i just have to order
one more round

feeling old
gibbous moon
at midnight

blues jam
just one
more round

chest pains
gibbous moon
beyond the clouds

home for the holidays
my son baring gifts
of dirty laundry

the view
during tax season
a mountain of paper

the frustrated musician’s
mountain
of unsold cds

athens burns
my spanakopita
slightly charred

each primary
less than secondary
to me

alone in a strange town
i toast
the unknown soldier

watching westminster
the dog snores
between us

long day at work
the dog fast asleep
on my pillow

knowing i shouldn’t
knowing i will
freshly-baked nachos

knowing i shouldn’t
knowing i will
home-made nachos

bad hop
the shortstop
sings soprano

winter mist
the midnight din
of the highway

last of the leftovers
the cry
of the seagull

ni una bomba más
la canción
del coquí

dive bar
the shallow end
of the gene pool

cabo sun
even the gull
seeks shade

overcast night
her tight
black stockings

winter rain
the dog’s disappointment
that i can’t stop it

winter rain
fresh flowers
beside a crooked tombstone

glaring sunlight
waving at someone
i think is someone else

waiting on hold
i fade away
to a tropical daydream

fair-weather clouds
lining up
in the texas heat

regrets
a winter storm
rattles the window

winter housefly
pitchers and catchers
report tomorrow

rattled by the rush
a song i can’t
get out of my head

snow in the forecast
i pick the shopping cart
with the shaky wheel

empty shopping mall
a child’s sandal
rides the escalator

pictured rocks
even prettier
than i pictured them

above the scree
picking up the pieces
and moving on

above the scree
wondering
where to go next

storm warnings expired
the dog snores
on the couch

college town bar
the grammatically correct
bathroom graffiti

the heat comes on
our old dog inches closer
to the vent

nor’easter
a trash can full
of broken umbrellas

restless night
an empty stretch
of highway

ash wednesday
a cigarette butt smouldering
on the church steps

a sudden draft
the feeling
that something’s missing

hate me
but don’t hate me
because i’m beautiful

new moon
my empty
wine glass

roadside trash
somebody mentions
my exwife’s name

peeling paint
my unshaved face

winter rain
wall street
closes flat

the day i realized
that she didn’t run away
and join the circus

snow flurries
reading the names
of the dead marines

a long week
i tell the taxi driver
to take me anywhere

fair-weather clouds
someone describes my taste
as retro

a fork in the road
suddenly i wonder
what’s for dinner

watching the sunset
hoping
she’ll spend the night

watching the sunset
already hoping
she’ll spend the night

weekend winding down
a ladybug
scales a cactus

dressed in sweats
ladybugs
cling to the ceiling

oscar night
acting
like i care

cleaning up
after the dog
her smile

oscar night
the red carpet
beneath the dog bed

drifting canoe
the faraway look
in your eyes

winter dusk
the old man
in the mirror

reeling in the years
the fishing trip
we never took

rondena
a song
i’ve always known

leap day
i kill
a common housefly

the old dog
can she still hear
the sound of snowfall?

the old dog
can she still hear
the snowfall?

the old dog
can she still hear
snow fall?

leap day
why do i feel
like i’m losing time?

mixed precipitation
forty doesn’t seem
so old to me

mixed precipitation
i’ve never written a haiku
about plum blossoms

cleaning the bathroom mirror
i can’t remove
that age spot

java exception
i should have had
hot cocoa

broken toy soldiers
in a box
marked return

ready to party
for the right price
a box of barbies

eight miles high
the bombs
grow silent

littering
the perfect lawn
a dead bird

snowmelt
watching my dog
watch the squirrels

gibbous moon
mondays aren’t so bad
after all

so uninspired
no stars
beyond the clouds

gibbous moon
my car finds
every pothole

super tuesday
a clear view
of the stars

daffodils
my mind turns
to baseball

super tuesday
savoring the taste
of a cheap wine

daffodils
my thoughts turn
to baseball

mid-winter diet
the hollow crunch
of carrot sticks

restless night
a jet flies
across the moon

march wind
the dog’s eyes
open and close

chronic pain
an oil truck
backs into the station

asturias
no me digas
que es un sueno

how high the moon
a foxtrot
beyond the clouds

double-play drills
i shift my beer
from left hand to right

suddenly remembering
her question
where will you spend eternity?

daylight savings
i’d love to have
that hour back

unseasonably mild
a blank page
in my journal

mass pike gridlock
and i rushed out the door
without coffee

wall street rallies
even this cheap wine
tastes better

junk mail
for my late father-in-law
daffodils in bloom

are you still there?
an old drinking buddy
on the wagon

march overcast
just enough wine
to be me

the ides of march
my dog can’t hear
the mail truck

in the waiting room
a bald-headed boy
plays hide-and-seek

in the waiting room
all eyes riveted
to the diarrhea commercial

strewn about
the war monument
piles of broken branches

venus rising
an overpowering scent
of cheap perfume

st. patrick’s day
fruit flies encircle
an empty pint glass

solar flare
see, i haven’t had
too much wine

sunday hangover
an unsolicited
text message

outdoor cafe
choking
on second-hand smoke

last day of winter
bright green streaks
in her hair

brewpub afternoon
steam from the kettle
fills the air

first date
she invites him over
to her ipad.

alone at the bar
i read the same email
over and over again

first day of spring
dusting off
the baseball cap

equinox
my sideburns
are uneven

first day of spring
mother raccoon
in the old oak tree

unable to write
a nature haiku
i swat at gnats

firing up the grill
the dog
so attentive

the dow drops
a great egret
perfectly still

march madness
checking my email
late at night

march madness
we’ll always have
baseball

friday afternoon
everyone looking
for the beer cart

inclement weather
old friends
with nothing to talk about

nightfall
venus and jupiter
walk into a bar

no longer new
the moon
the dog
and me

an unarmed victim
no right
to remain silent

unable to read
the hidden message
in her eyes

sliver moon
the old man
scowls

dusk
the crow’s feet
on his face

the receptionist
offers me a kiss
from her candy dish

the final four
hoping my youngest son
doesn’t reenlist

not quite incense
a smoldering cigarette
at the curb

placencia sunrise
a jesus lizard runs
across the lagoon

final four
time to buy
another six pack

meeting an old friend
neither of us knows
which star is which

vieques sunset
the glint of an old tank
mired in the mud

in my dreams
i recognize them
cherry blossoms

cherry blossoms
who is cropped out
of her profile photo?

wall street rallies
an ice castle
in the sun

stiff march wind
feeling
my age

sitting on the stoop
that summer seems
so long ago

once in a lifetime
repeats the recorded voice
on the phone

cold snap
another game
of solitaire

killer frost
her blood red
lipstick

cold morning
the songbird
interrupts my dream

watching my grandkids
grow up
on facebook

an awkward pause
not quite able
to describe this wine

crescent moon
an unfamiliar
neighborhood

approaching clouds
laughing at a joke
i’ve heard before

regrets
an abandoned
lighthouse

wide awake
beneath an ocean
of dreams

loneliness
releasing
the butterfly

starless night
the step
i never took

writer’s block
raccoon prints
on the porch

twilight
a stack
of lottery tickets

march rain
torn lottery tickets
litter the sidewalk

lost
in the march rain
the robin’s song

as if it mattered
a ladybug crawls
across the ceiling

twilight
another weekend get-away
gets away from us

palm sunday
my granddaughters model
their easter dresses

waiting room
a chart of the human spine
slightly off-center

weight room
i decide
i’m just passing through

spring rain
my baseball glove
on my head

news of my head cold
goes viral

tempest in a teapot
why did i ever
give up coffee?

dogwood blossoms
the neighborhood tomboy
blots her lipstick

between sighs
muddy footprints
on the front porch

signs of spring
a songbird
interrupts my dream

middle-age crisis
to buy or not to buy
a new baseball glove

calling 911
gibbous moon
beyond the clouds

opening day
a pink hat
with the tag still attached

pink moon
none of us
stands so tall

calling at my door
on a starless night
a black eyed dog

end of a long week
i push on a door
that says pull

end of a long week
i push on a door
marked pull

the first date
that wasn’t
passed over
again

alone at the bar
passed over
again

resurrection day
my teenaged son
won’t get out of bed

here comes the flood
the televangelist’s
choreographed tears

the morning after
wall street lays
an easter egg

on the road again
destination
anywhere

watching me
like a hawk
a hawk

asleep before 10
all the broken
streetlights

dusk
a mountain
of bills

waning moon
i don’t remember
your name either

april dawn
a broken swing
pushed by wind

spring hailstorm
an ice cube
in my glass of wine

raw night
an empty bottle
of hot sauce

not sure
what she meant by that
venus rising

this morning’s alarm
cats in love

twilight
watching the grandchildren
grow up online

flashing blue
the police lights
in my grandson’s eyes

lost for words
where the old oak
used to be

home opener
even the bad beer
tastes good

cloudless april sky
why we endure
the new england winter

filing my taxes
a child’s balloon
floats away

tan ocupado
en una tarde soleada
el colibrí

hope springs eternal
watering
the dead hydrangeas

cloudless sky
watering
the dead hydrangeas

unseasonably warm
i mentally
undress her

shooting star
i forget
this haiku

tax day
a smoldering
brush fire

shooting star
dreaming of a place
i’ve never been

telling myself it’s natural
my daughter nurses her baby

awake before dawn
the emptiness
of fog

news of his illness
a vapor trail
in the sky

his faraway voice
a vapor trail
in the sky

my rising blood pressure
a vapor trail
in the sky

wilting daffodils
a vapor trail
in the sky

her graying muzzle
a vapor trail
in the sky

alone and afraid
the dog
no one wants

spring sunset
a faded red ribbon
tied to a tree

spring sunset
a twig snaps
beneath the tire

spring sunset
a sigh of resignation
when the lawn mower starts

spring sunset
the next-door neighbor’s
noisy convertible

spring sunset
our old dog’s
heavy sigh

spring twilight
and still no sign
of the first firefly

the road not taken
i’ll never know
where it didn’t lead me

to what
do i owe this occasion
mr. cardinal?

cherry blossoms
my daughter’s
pregnant belly

fenway hangover
now cheering
for a rain-out

earth day
the dog’s
muddy paws

wind-driven rain
an error
in my tax return

wind-driven rain
trying to remember
the last time i was happy

soaked to the bone
we keep telling ourselves
we need the rain

play ball!
the dog’s snout
against my knee

fenway spring
all the pretty
pink hats

lost in thought
cracks in the asphalt
of the old bike path

the place i once called home
cracks in the asphalt
of the old bike path

childhood memory
cracks in the asphalt
of the old bike path

crescent moon
venus
blushes

my home town
cracks in the asphalt
of the old bike path

how she glows
in the light
of the citgo sign

walking the dog
the taste
of rain

pasear al perro el sabor
de lluvia

boston spring
a towering pop fly
in every backyard

blow man blow!
road weary city boys
order another round

after one too many
dr. sax
on the shore of the merrimack

news of her illness
the leaves
whisper

our weekend to-do list
the mockingbird
laughs

weekend chores
the cardinals
tend their nest

heightened security
a police dog
yawns

navy pier
the kiss
that never happened

venus rising
my granddaughter finds
mommy’s mascara

a sudden chill
the view from brooklyn
without the towers

where does the time go?
a hole
in my pocket

silence
the wine bottle
empty

pay day
morning dew
in the bright sunlight

may day
my daughter chooses
her daughter’s birthday

zen breakfast
a bagel
and buddha

a new horizon
no place to put
all these words

new moon
the newest grandchild
days away

deadheading
the daffodils
a may-december romance

upscale pub
the trustafarian’s
dreadful dreads

troubled sleep
the dog jumps
into our bed

morning fog
i win
at solitaire

a new grandchild
i wear a loud shirt
to work

mist turns to drizzle
a house on the market
for over a year

mist turns to drizzle
a drunkard
stares at my dog

extra innings
the dog pulling
on the leash

extra innings
flushing the spider
down the toilet

reflected
in silent puddles
thunderclouds

full moon
beyond the clouds
all my darkest secrets

to take arms
against a sea of troubles
the rest is silence

placencia moonlight
i can
breathe again

afraid of writer’s block
i write
nothing

does the dog sense the irony
of marking the dogwood?

slightly past its peak
the dogwood
and me

gibbous moon
the dog chases a rabbit
in her dreams

dark skies
rereading
a cryptic email

soaking rain
the call
that never came

soaking rain
too sad to write
another word

a long night
throwing back another
home run ball

fading and brittle
his crayon portrait
of me

sigh
dogwood petals
fall

that second margarita
lives on
in my hangover

a perfect day
to sleep
a perfect day away

wishing my daughters
a happy mother’s day
dogwood petals fall

en una cuarto olvidado
los soldados de juguete roto
marcado como retorno

asleep on the beach
waking in panic
from another work dream

shooting star
leaving a voicemail
for my son

restless sleep
these railroad tracks
are older than me

imagining the conductor
thinks i’m invisible

changing his seat
the business man pretends
not to bump his head

biting through an ice cube
as her fragrance
drifts by

disappointing news
walking the dog
in the rain

persistent drizzle
she thanks me for roses
i didn’t send

all aboard!
a pigeon
considers it

missing my train
a steaming
manhole cover

downtown crossing
two strangers
who’ve met before

waiting for the train
the girl i was staring at
flexes her biceps

cloudless sky
the catbird
in the dogwood tree

cramped café
the taste of coffee
in my tea

blue moon
wondering where
the week has gone

shutout
i leave
another voicemail

solar eclipse
staring
at an empty sky

moonless night
the sparks
from a discarded cigarette

opening night
to be
the play

approaching rain
the dog curls up
on the couch

explaining to my mother
that wicked
means good

missing the train
pigeons
keep me company

light applause
the tarp
comes off

twilight
a video of my dog
breathing

interrupting
the open mic
angry birds

overcast night
the starting pitcher
hangs his head

news of her passing
this morning’s rain
somehow wetter

after the rain
peonies
take a bow

broken clouds
the x-rays
return negative

fender bender
no better
from this angle

no longer a puppy
our dog’s
violent dreams

after all this time
we didn’t have
enough time

after all this time
we thought we’d have
more time

finishing another beer
we sign
our living wills

twilight
the dog naps
between naps

waning moon
the dog’s walk
shorter and shorter

spring breeze
a cloud
of aphids

blown save
an abandoned
pocket dial

memorial day
a parade
of ants

low tide
seagulls fight
over a bottle cap

before the storm
culling
the tomatillos

draining my pint glass
the end
of a long weekend

puesta de sol
una libélula se posa
en guadalupe

glow of the laptop
all of the friends
i don’t know

approaching storm
a flickering
streetlight

steady downpour
one more beer

rain delay
an eight dollar
hot dog

silent crows
my son asks
for a loan

tropical depression
my untanned legs

dirty laundry
wall street
takes a bath

rites of spring
dog and woodchuck
play cat and mouse

rites of spring
the bicycle courier’s
bleach blonde dreadlocks

cactus flower
crossing the river
with two names

dampening
my enthusiasm
driving rain

full moon
what can i say
that hasn’t been said?

my childhood ball field
now a cookie-cutter
cul-de-sac

twilight
does the dog know
we’re talking about her?

strawberry moon
the receptionist’s
bright red hair

transit of venus
the subway doors close
behind her

crooked and worn
the for sale sign
at an empty house

our old dog
the silence
between her breaths

pop-up showers
the peaks and valleys
of wall street

evening dog walk
wondering what the birds
are saying about us

scattered thunderstorms
the dog’s
unsteady gait

second-hand smoke
a stranger’s litany
about trying to quit

first beer of the weekend
a freshly mowed lawn

bittersweet
the birthday wishes
on her facebook page

light drizzle
the dog’s
abbreviated walk

waiting for the bus
death
by a thousand texts

waiting for the bus
all the fashion statements
i’d never make

the silence
between
shadows

returning the scowl
of the old man
in the mirror

afternoon shade
the old dog’s
twitching muzzle

summer twilight
yes in fact
i do like my white hair

twilight
the grit of my
5 o’clock shadow

this old house
the winter
and the damage done

recuerdos
del beso
que nunca fue

crescent moon
the unblinking eyes
of a nervous dog

extra innings
opening the emergency
bottle of wine

from the sound of it
the crows don’t think
it’s partly cloudy

summer twilight
the silence
between sighs

father’s day
being told that i’m
the last one to call

strike three
the final beer
of the weekend

the sign
on the old church reads
now leasing

introducing
twilight
the robin’s song

staring into the darkness
of her unblinking eyes

heat on the way
a snake slithering
in the grass

burning my lips
i remember
what a regular coffee is

summer rain
a parking lot
blow job

guilty as charged
of calling her eyes
arresting

lunch al fresco
wondering what the robins
are saying about us

between thunderstorms
the weekly exchange
of the children

thank you
for never moving
the hat i left

more thunderstorms
another down day
on wall street

a break
from the storm
birdsong

green light
the dog accelerates
into the breeze

a break in the clouds
works of art
from my grandchildren

rain delay
one more
glass of wine

restless night
a songbird calling out
to itself

waiting for me
on this balmy night
a spider web

acute back pain
kudzu climbing
a telephone pole

hot new orleans pub
the tuba player pivots
to let me use the can

hours before dawn
the mockingbird
and me

cabo san lucas
drunk on sunshine
by noon

balmy night
the bittersweet
climbs itself

in the waiting room
a plastic model
of the perfect spine

moving day
the screwdriver i replaced
years ago

last day of june
sweat drips
from a beer bottle

speed trap
i lower
the volume

twilight
a barn swallow
in perfect contrast

hot summer night
those birds flying backwards
aren’t birds

over breakfast
explaining how johnny
has two mommies

correcting my parents
no news
is just no news

mystic river
not so mystical
after all

wondering what it all means
this cacophony
of sparrows

twilight
the medication
kicks in

his funeral
so many platitudes
sincerely faked

windless night
the view from brooklyn
without the towers

boston overcast
taller and grayer
than me

july overcast
the thunder
beyond the clouds

july overcast
the fireworks
beyond the clouds

heat wave
a spider dangles
from the windchimes

news from overseas
the thunderstorm
that barely missed us

long days
a dinner serenade
from the landscapers next-door

one empty
bottle of wine later
trying to read my watch

summer gridlock
a song i hate
in the next lane

independence day
my wife leaves me home
with the dog

independence day
a barking dog
behind a barbwire fence

fourth of july
at least there’s no ban
on fireflies

independence day
my hair won’t stay
where it’s been combed

independence day
the dog walks away
from her food bowl

independence day
a garter snake
sheds its skin

the heat of night
a running car
on lover’s lane

summer dusk
remembering when
only birds tweeted

hot summer night
locusts
over a techno beat

doctor’s office
a dog-eared folder
with my name on it

summer chill
yankee fans
in boston

so unfair!
tropical weather
in new england

summer dog walk
the police cruiser’s
blue-and-whites

clouds without rain
striking out
with the bases loaded

departure lounge
our pilot
takes a nap

thunderclouds
a dream
about the towers

her final breath
my world
goes black

leaving work early
a yield sign
obscured by bittersweet

twilight
our dog’s favorite blanket
freshly washed and folded

her final breath
at a loss
for metaphors

gibbous moon
one final sparkle
in her eyes

in those minutes
before the alarm sounds
echoes of her footsteps

before sunrise
the loneliness
of silence

yes i can see her
sleeping in the clover
in my dreams

summer haze
even her toys
seem lost without her

a 3-hour layover
in cleveland
insert punchline here

3-hour layover
drinking the loneliness
away

pity the willow
you’d be weeping too
at 109 degress

how could she know?
the cat sits on my lap
and purrs

motionless
the palm branches
and me

overnight shower
her restless footsteps
in my dreams

torrential downpour
my breakfast plans
pouring down the storm drain

arizona rain
sharing a stranger’s
smoke break

fresh coffee
a break
in the clouds

sunny-side up
a woman half my age
calls me honey

desert cityscape
the superstition mountains
and a construction crane

waiting for the bar to open
the hat salesman’s
impromptu pitch

less than hip
the hotel bar
after happy hour

a shallow sigh
mourning the passing
of a desert shower

stormy skies
the color
of my hangover

the airport scanner
can’t detect
my emptiness

i’m not talking about this any more,
he says, over and over again

a true wonder of the world
how she fills
her grand canyon t-shirt

holding pattern
suddenly the longing
for home

holding pattern
everything i want
beyond the clouds

wearing on
as the wine wears off
the highway din

crowded terminal
all lines lead
to dunkin donuts

summer shower
steam rises
from the asphalt

low tide
the hidden message
in the sea gull tracks

passing cold front
a little girl drops
her ice cream cone

after the storm
i even miss
her muddy footprints

no turning back
a young couple
merges cd collections

where we
used to walk
fireflies

red light
a broken umbrella
crosses the street

overcast
my trip to the mailbox
unnoticed

quenching
the silence
another beer

recurring nightmare
waking up
to an empty dog bed

where’s the camera?
my granddaughter’s
milk goatee

our modest backyard
seems somehow bigger
without our little squirrel-chaser

home from work early
why the surprise
mr. crow?

there
a haiku that isn’t about
how much i miss my dog

broken clouds
just barely feeling
the wine

gray skies
the stubble
of my unshaven face

home from work
the thunderclouds
also silent

revelation
her back lit
sundress

chasing gold
happy hour
at an upscale bar

opening the window
i still find myself
looking for her

from my office window
i pretend
to hear the rain

housefly
ruining
the perfect spider web

rain clouds
imagining myself
above it all

still pond
so many summer homes
under water

morning mist
the song
of the coquí

everything old
is new again
except me

steady drizzle
the tour bus arrives
at walden pond

born on the day
blind willie mctell died
broke down engine blues

crowded train
what danger lurks
beneath her snake tattoo?

never quite
emerging
from the clouds
the sun
and me

faces in the mirror
even wearier
than they appear

summer sunset
forgetting where
i stashed my will

four medallas later
he won’t give up
his sofrito recipe

steady rain
missing her paw prints
on my pillow

under cover of darkness
a truck delivers
tomorrow’s bagels

summer rain
my broken heart

last day of july
a half-ripened
habanero

summer rain
knowing when it’s time
to call the game

a bit heavy
on the hot sauce
i hold my tongue

on the campaign trail
a rat
flatters snakes

grain moon
the cascade
of a freshly-poured ale

finally friday
i leave no trace
of the margarita salt

heat of day
the dragonfly
is not afraid of me

hazy morning
a ladybug crawls
across the ceiling

between
thunderstorms
locusts

after the rain
one more
glass of wine

stiff breeze
the slap
of the window washer’s ropes

summer breeze
a shimmering
spider web

waking from a dream
a light
in our neighbor’s window

london pub crawl
five amber rings
on a bar towel

full of words
an empty wine glass
in my hand

windless night
searching the web
for available dogs

los viejos argue
about what is and isn’t
mofongo

tornado watch!
a great name
for a cocktail

let grandpa show you
how to spit out
watermelon seeds

summer rain
daydreams
of our winter vacation

lingering clouds
another photo
of an adorable puppy

lingering clouds
the inevitability
of the gym

tropical depression
an empty bottle
of rum

meteor shower
somewhere
above the clouds

closing ceremony
something about
remaining friends

puppy love
sharing
a sigh

a water cooler conversation
between strangers
about death

the ides of august
a half-ripened
habanero

approaching storm
the chile peppers
hotter than we thought

locusts
another night
without our dog

while i should be sleeping
another yawn
on the puppy-cam

dockside bar
all the ships
i’ve never sailed

august dusk
a dog barking
in the distance

faraway clouds
nursing the twinge
in my back

the alarm sounds
surrendering
to another monday

writer’s block
another swipe
at the same mosquito

explaining that
it wasn’t always this way
driftwood

nightfall
anticipating
the silence

bending
the wrong way
cat tails

game out of hand
i pour one glass
too many

like a video game
the projected path
of the hurricane

first beer of the weekend
yes, let’s postpone
our shopping trip

imminent storm
a text message
i won’t answer

end of summer
all the unfamiliar names
in the line-up

was it all a dream?
the sound of footsteps
on the moon

my childhood ball field
now a gated community

deep blue sky
puppy-proofing
the house

waiting for the storm
an unopened bottle
of rum

dusk
the champagne and i
chill

safe from the storm
an open bottle
of rum

partly cloudy
i blow out the candles
without making a wish

reading my chart
the doctor dreams
of a bigger boat

for the first time
i hear a song
i always knew

end of summer
i refuse
to grab a blanket

first day of school
all the empty backpacks
lined up at the curb

waiting for the bus
a song
i don’t want to end

marquee moon
waiting for
the kiss of death

writer’s block
a hole
in the fence

blue moon
a smile
from a stranger

does the coquí know
that the summer
is ending?

old mill town
a rusty tractor
on the front lawn

a long day
the puppy’s eyes
slowly shut

first light
the puppy barks
at its reflection

perhaps the mosquitoes
haven’t heard
that summer is over

back to work
a puppy
chasing its tail

lingering heat
the pitcher’s
fastball grip

lingering heat
last night’s tequila
on my breath

leaving for work
the dog climbs into
my spot in bed

the morning news
between
puppy kisses

celebrating
our anniversary
the puppy’s tail wags

hearing my favorite song
she asks
do you like this?

in the waiting room
coffee grinds
at the bottom of my cup

overcast
a playground
closed for construction

dawn
the puppy’s eyes
almost open

twilight
wild turkeys
on a factory lawn

the beach of my dreams
the lone and level sands
stretch far away

hurricane warning
the puppy discovers
the toilet paper

september dusk
wishing i could see
just one more firefly

threat of thunderstorms
the puppy’s head
on my lap

morning overcast
the one person who doesn’t want
to pet the puppy

full of wine
i sing
to the dog

long night
another pitcher
hands over the ball

eleven years later
a day of moments
of silence

leaning closer
the jukebox plays
smokestack lightning

sunset
the puppy naps
in his kennel

only wednesday
i stop fast-forwarding
between commercials

last days of summer
one more ghost story
around the fire

maple-colored moon
remembering
mom’s pancakes

harvard square station
a mozart sonata
between buses

between buses
a mozart sonata

stiff sea breeze
the drawbridge operator’s
bushy beard

old sea port
the tugboat’s
tattered flag

dockside pub
wondering where
the cormorant went

dockside pub
the bride-to-be’s
bright pink tiara

after the break
somewhat less jumping
to the jump blues band

wet paint
puppy pawprints
everywhere

sun peeking
through tree tops
a beagle howls

sunset
a neighbor
mispronounces my name

the music of the ocean
in an empty bottle
of tequila

throbbing headache
the conductor punches
my ticket twice

lop-sided loss
a puppy
chasing a moth

crisp september night
remembering
her voice

layoff rumors
a broken branch
dangling above the roof

a losing season
the puppy catches
a bumblebee

wide-eyed puppy
believing he can
catch the sparrow

restless morning
the puppy
shares my pillow

waxing moon
i kick
a pebble

autumn sunset
just starting to taste
this beer

a heavy sigh
wishing she could have
seen this sunset

autumn sunset
my newest granddaughter’s
passport photo

red alert!
a leaf falls
in front of the puppy

riding into
the sunset
the old train

gibbous moon
pulling an acorn
from the puppy’s mouth

election season
the dog would rather
eat leaves

gibbous moon
something scratching
behind the wall

rainy season
our rum supply
runs dry

rough day on wall street
a shop owner
sweeping up acorns

rough day at work
singing along
to a song i don’t like

lingering clouds
updating the roster
of his fantasy team

fenway finale
my 8-dollar beer
served luke warm

bracing wind
the sound of geese
overhead

moon almost full
the dog pacing
back and forth

autumn rain
the puppy
doesn’t understand

afternoon meeting
i’d rather
watch the rain

waking from a dream
footprints
on the moon

purple sky
the puppy playing
with our late dog’s toy

october rain
a crow calls
to itself

election season
an old tree
full of sparrows

sparrows
the puppy’s eyes

finding myself
on my mother’s
charm bracelet

regrets
i count
the stars

autumn morning
an old man
straightens a tombstone

on a quiet street
the puppy barks
at buddha

october fog
a sinus headache

red light
lovers
triangulating

town hall
the newlyweds
jaywalk

guernica
the light
goes out

street musician
serenading
the sparrows

after the rain
the orange
october sky

sandpipers
back
and forth

these words
beyond
the overcast

spring snow
an old crush
and her new baby

how late
is too late
for a belated
birthday card?

cardboard scarecrow
scaring only
the puppy

overflowing dumpster
the politician’s
smile

uptown bar
grammatically correct
bathroom graffiti

flu season
campaign ads
ad nauseum

where our old dog
used to walk
the puppy’s footsteps

cloudless sky
all my hometown hangouts
gone

late-night walk
can the puppy smell
my late dog’s footprints?

killing frost
steam rises
from a storm drain

killing frost
her eyes

hard freeze
our late dog’s
ashes

warm october night
the beady little eyes
of a skunk

between powerpoint slides
her long, long hair

unseasonably mild
another lull
in the conversation

changing weather
a skip
in my favorite record

midnight
the dog’s portrait
guards her ashes

last call
sirens

unseasonably mild
a ladybug
all on her own

tonight’s debate
red
or white?

mild earthquake
the puppy pounces
on a leaf

before sunrise
the sleeping puppy
hiccups

emptying my wine glass
rain water
fills the cistern

dusk
the dog steps
on its shadow

crescent moon
the puppy learns
to howl

not a pin drop
telling my granddaughters
the story of echo

october rain
red sox and yankees
and a long winter off

thunder
the dow
falls

the puppy’s favorite bone
squeaks
when he bites it

tropical wave
bidding farewell
to sunshine

swirling at my feet
all the leaves
i just finished sweeping

stiff breeze
lottery tickets
in the air

beyond
every horizon
words

sigh
a shooting star

lost for words
a dead sparrow
at my feet

final debate
i pull another rock
from the puppy’s mouth

balancing the budget
i cut up my credit cards

final debate
someone has
to walk the dog

along the boardwalk
an elderly couple
sharing silence

bare trees
a stock market
sell-off

leading us
down a quiet street
our shadows

quiet street
shadows

i’m a believer!
her miracle bra

approaching storm
the puppy silent
in his crate

strikeout
falling
leaves

bad coffee
glaring
at my age spots

the news
is the storm
is the news

approaching storm
the raging
hyperbole

holding my breath
the eaves whistle

after the storm
leaves clinging
to a fallen branch

devil’s night
a fly trapped
between window panes

leaving a voicemail
the taste of coffee
in my tea

between showers
the puppy naps

halloween breakfast
an angel serves me
a runny egg

day of the dead
what to do
with the leftover candy?

a constant draft
at my exgirlfriend’s
favorite restaurant

day of the dead
a wall street
resurrection

day of the dead
i need
a stronger coffee

day of the dead
the puppy sniffs
a smashed pumpkin

regrets
so much water
under the bridge

bird on a wire
my third cup
of coffee

after the storm
there is no
after the storm

her skin
the lilt
of a saxophone

where the ball field
used to be
an empty office building

frost
her
scowl

early sunset
our restless puppy

undecided
should i finish my wine
before i walk the dog?

not a video game
my son’s
next deployment

dinner time
the puppy hunts
for treats

first snow
the puppy’s eyes
widen

waking from a dream
the puppy’s wagging tail

sigh
first snow

blasphemy!
a winter storm
named for a goddess

winter rain
a puppy’s nose print
against the window

also having
a restless night
the winter fly

end of a long week
the answer is
rocks and salt

waning
the moon
and i

at first light
the growl
of a chainsaw

lost for words
my elementary school
in ruins

veteran’s day
fresh flowers
against a worn tombstone

cold snap
she asks if i’m ready
for the holidays

peace
i kill
a fly

november rain
my gray hair
feeling grayer

approaching cold front
her scowl

home
tequila
sunset

vieques sunset
spiced rum
on the rocks

buried treasure
a little girl
picks her nose

another meeting
the sound of geese
overhead

hard freeze
her cleavage

too much wine
the television
glows

pay day
still
a gray day

explaining to my grandson
what a crack pipe is

explaining to my grandson
that grandpa
was a baby too

clinging
to a lost summer
the last leaf
and me

revolution?
a che guevera t-shirt
and designer jeans

november sunset
miles to go
before i sleep

shooting star
the puppy
on our old dog’s leash

hunter’s moon
the promise
of black friday

shooting star
the weekend
is over

silencing
the cicadas
screech owl

intermittent clouds
finishing
a stutterer’s sentence

hunting
through the overcast
for the hunter’s moon

calm seas
thanksgiving dinner
for two

thanksgiving dog walk
sharing
the silence

thanksgiving parade
one siren
after another

flickering streetlight
the dog chases
a moth

thanksgiving
all of the turkeys
on the road

black friday
an anomaly
on the mri

leaf blowers
the dayquil
wears off

cyber saturday
a double espresso

november wind
an uninvited guest

cold winter night
the warm glow
of a laptop

cyber monday
the puppy barks
at a screensaver

snow in the forecast
the puppy shivers
in his sleep

hoar frost
she doesn’t
recognize me

first snow
wondering why
we’re still friends

snow turns to rain
wishing i could
take back the words

mixed precipitation
calling the puppy
by our late dog’s name

haiku or senryu?
i miss
a shooting star

stiff breeze
clinging to
a powerball ticket

low tide
another phone call
unanswered

last day of november
i ask the bartender
for a hurricane

winter rain
the dog and i
trade sighs

first beer of the weekend
the ceiling fan
wobbles

christmas forecast
more than
a little chile

nights lengthen
the puppy barks
at falling snow

first snow
the puppy sniffs
his paw prints

winter fog
the puppy’s tail
stops wagging

lost for words
another poet
passes on

warm winter day
but still
no dragonfiles

winter fog
i’ve run out
of cold medicine

green light
the quavering diva
drives away

green light
the dubstep
drives away

winter fog
silencing
the harbor bell

winter fog
imagining
the harbor bell

take five
one last time

oh to hear
take five
one last time

cold snap
the puppy wonders
where the moths are

wednesday night
a cheap wine

twenty days to christmas
an empty wine glass

mild winter day
our dog gets
a christmas card

the weekend forecast
a 100% chance
of beer

december rain
the dog barks
at santa claus

snow in the forecast
my father
turns 80

winter deepens
missing the song
of the tree frog

december rain
the weekend
melts away

winter moths
my mother
buys an iphone

alone
i win a game
of solitaire

the perfect pub
where nobody
knows my name

twilight
winter
deepens

december
how the cold sun
burns

approaching solstice
the candle and i
flicker

beyond the police tape
the flickering lights
of a christmas tree

watching the news
i feel guilty
for being alive

outside the box
another box

meaningful action
on-line petitions
in my spam box

meaningful action
another on-line petition
in my spam folder

winter dog walk
it’s the news
that makes me numb

southern comfort
not so comfortable
after more than one

oblivious to the news
a shooting star

comfortably numb
i forget
everything

dive bar
all eyes
on the keno screen

december birthday
the puppy and i
share a blanket

rain puddles
the puppy barks
at his reflection

unseasonably mild
my mother
on a motorcycle

winter fog
i pocket-dial
a dead friend

winter fog
regrets

snow in the forecast
my hawaiian shirts
shiver

beer rings
framing
this haiku

december wind
the puppy snores

snow in the forecast
some extra rum
in the rum cake

celebrating
the end of the world
the puppy yawns

longest night
the tequila
wears off

cold snap
a moth falls
from the shutter

christmas eve
a shopping cart full
of empty cans

crowded intersection
christmas carols collide
with dub step

a white christmas
a glimpse of my hair
in the mirror

a present for me
my grandson doesn’t want
a toy gun for christmas

bitter cold
is there no one to mourn
the dead mouse?

approaching storm
the quiet
before the quiet

bitter coffee
regrets

tomorrow’s weather
coffee grounds
in my cup

hiding behind the clouds
the winter sun
and me

rounding the corner
a dog
barks at buddha

snowblindness
interrupting
my tropical daydream

the news in washington
tires spinning
on black ice

first snow
the puppy
chasing butterflies

holding a snowball
with a knuckleball grip

christmas lights
the eyes
of a shelter dog

resolutions
broken promises
to myself

searching
for meaning
beneath the road salt

fiscal cliff
fireworks
over the harbor

new year’s day
our empty champagne glasses
almost touching

wind
winter
deepens

ice on the windshield
a flock of geese
above the horizon

remembering
the shy little boy
in the mirror

asked how
i would like my cocktail
i reply immediately

dirty snow
she untags herself
from our photo

winter overcast
my thoughts
exactly

glass half empty
when just above freezing
seems warm

winter dusk
a bottle of tequila
we’ve yet to open

sharing
a stranger’s
smoke break

housewarming gift
the new neighbor’s
second-hand smoke

love in the air
a girl on her cell phone
walks right into traffic

epiphany
i’ve locked my keys
in the car

snowmelt
yesterday’s
trash

my favorite color
is this
perfect ale

their silent curbside vigil
discarded christmas trees

piercing the night
her stiletto heels

slightly tipsy
i pretend
she’s smiling at me

black ice
stocks slip
on wall street

letters from an old flame
burning in the fire

midwinter night
the furnace and the vodka
kick in

lies
dirty
snow

cold coffee
between meetings

moments before departure
i miss my dog

airport sunrise
the service dog
sleeps

between flights
the skycap’s
whistle

an awkward silence
when the taxi driver
mentions amway

tequila sunrise
translating the words
in a couple’s argument

within sight
of the eco-resort
a horse tied to a fence

between suitcases
a sedated cat

todos santos morning
oh hummingbird
why can’t you relax?

high noon
an impromptu
tequila tasting

open air concert
so many hats
on so many bald heads

jet lag
my second wind
flies away

encore
a stray dog
on the dance floor

they’re playing our song
sea breeze rustling
in the palms

what secrets are woven
between the branches
of the palapa?

three women
comparing medications
over cocktails

sunrise
interupting
my reposado dreams

pescadero
a sea of turquoise
at the farmer’s market

ex-pat band
tweeting
between sets

open air market
a dog’s collar reads
please don’t feed me

monday hangover
the call
of a mourning dove

meat on the grill
the street dog
takes a detour

two margaritas later
electric cherry blossoms

approaching storm
if only it were
a metaphor

vacation over
the puppy
yawns

baja morning
shopkeepers sweep
the broken sidewalks

seven thousand miles away
echoes of my heartbeat

back to work
snow turns
to mud

cold night
the dog’s eyes
clenched shut

nice day for a walk
the taxi driver’s
stoned expression

pescadero sun
last night’s margarita
on the horizon

waking
from the endless summer
of my dreams

temperature dropping
i crave
a frozen margarita

gun control
the girl i was staring at
flexes her biceps

rocks and salt
a winter dog walk
in new england

changing trains
at park street
i remember you

wind advisory
an extra helping
of rice and beans

our dog’s favorite place
between us

changing trains at park street
i forget where i’m going

pink champagne on ice
daddy’s little girl
turns 30

deep freeze
her scowl

road salt
wishing i had
a margarita

winter sunset
the lights come on
in the homeless shelter

a distant snow plow
pitchers and catchers report
in sixteen days

fair-weather clouds
stocks rise
on wall street

sigh
a sleeping puppy

a dusting of snow
the old dog’s muzzle

winter wins
my hawaiian shirt
covered by a sweater

wolf moon
the sleepy puppy
won’t sleep

weather advisory
avoid winter
whenever possible

lonely night
i name a star
after you

lost
on the road
less traveled

deep winter
the snow turns
to silence

snow turns to rain
the rest
is silence

field of dreams
snow turns to mud

winter warm-up
the dog’s breath
against my cheek

winter warm-up
paw prints
disappear

in the waiting room
all the crossword puzzles
solved

february 1st
making sure my baseball cap
is where i left it

asking the hotel clerk
if our room
is the one with ghosts

winter sunset
sharing
a sigh

ground hog day
the puppy peeks out
from under a blanket

work dreams
the howling wind

ground hog day
a christmas wreath
peeks from the trash

super bowl sunday
my thoughts turn
to baseball

super bowl sunday
the puppy’s dramatic catch
of a snowflake

raw night
an extra helping
of hot sauce

midwinter night
the furnace and the wine
kick in

cold snap
my beachfront fantasy

snow in the forecast
the dog twitching
in his sleep

approaching snow plow
trying to remember
my dream

winter advisory
towering piles
of hyperbole

winter advisory
daunting piles
of hyperbole

ignoring my thirst
for just a moment
milky way

imminent blizzard
the puppy gets hold
of the toilet paper

a rose
is not a rose
until it is yours

winter whiteout
i erase her
from my mind

my tropical dream
interrupted
by the snowplow

waiting for news
a snow shovel
in the garden

blowing snow
my thoughts drift
to baseball

snow blind
she tells me
i don’t look my age

bitter coffee
miles to go
before i sleep

drinking alone
the lipstick
on my pint glass

state of the union
an old crush shows off
her engagement ring

road salt
missing the taste
of the ocean

ash wednesday
the glow of a cigarette
in the alley way

valentine’s day
a sloppy kiss
from the dog

deep winter
harbor bells
in my dreams

snow blind
i wonder what rhymes
with orange

crescent moon
asking once again
if my sons have called

between snowstorms
muddy paw prints

winter thaw
the dog’s breath

trapped between windows
the winter fly

red light
she catches me
staring

dreaming of retirement
the crunch
of road salt

setting the mouse trap
wondering where
it all went wrong

snow flurries
questions i wouldn’t ask
the president

winter overcast
all the medicine
in my medicine cabinet

corner deli
house sparrows
out on the town

empty highway
should i zig
or zag?

forever spring
the green monster
of my dreams

marriage
head bowed
against a quiet window

winter rain
no longer too young
to play the blues

no longer
too young
to play the blues

winter rain
waiting for news
i don’t want

freezing rain
extra salt
on my margarita glass

only wednesday
a cheap white wine

love and romance
there may be
trouble ahead

morning meditation
a dead fly
in my living room

following the sun
puppy’s nap-time

patch of sun
the puppy naps

the poet’s bedroom
four bare walls
and an empty wine bottle

end of summer
the ice cream man’s
skull and crossbones tattoo

somewhere beyond
the freezing rain
full moon

half-empty bar
correcting the misspelled
bathroom graffiti

restless night
snow turns to rain
and back again

outdoor dining
do these sparrows
have reservations?

deep winter
my lonely sandals
in the back of the closet

hastily stuffed
into a tattered box
my career

finally lost
on the quiet beach
of my dreams

reflected
in the puppy’s eyes
full moon

restless
winter mud

winter rain
no one calls my gray hair
premature

winter rain
a grammatically incorrect
rejection letter

winter thaw
my daughter’s voice

winter overcast
the ones
who never call

sequestered
by winter rain
the bored puppy

melting snow
my granddaughter’s fingers
in my hair

moving day
not especially
moving

special election
a skunk
in our backyard

entering the tunnel
my granddaughter’s eyes
widen

waiting on hold
restless storm clouds

waiting on hold
another song
i despise

covered in snow
the things
i can’t forget

cold wind
wondering when
her relationship status changed

high tide
the painkillers
kick in

tropical daydream
salt on the rim
of my margarita glass

fresh snow
the same
rusty snow shovel

fresh snow
the same
rusty shovel

the line drive
caught
in my dreams

heavy sigh
releasing
the butterfly

melting snow
another generation
with my eyes

the superintendent
apologizes
for holding school

melting snow
head bowed
against a quiet window

waking from a dream
the crunch
of road salt

beneath the palapa
a margarita
and a dream

daylight savings
i leave
too big a tip

new moon
an old t-shirt
i can’t throw away

psychic karate
you should know
the number

new moon
the emptiness

approaching rain
a missed phone call

sad news
walking the dog
in the rain

another mystery
the empty milk carton
in the refrigerator

stiff march wind
make mine
a double

after the rain
silence

reading her obituary
the howling wind

lost for words
i misplace
my kindle

on-time departure
my coffee
down the drain

over freeze-dried coffee
a discussion of supplements

fallen palm branches
another story
i’ve heard before

a lull in the conversation
the mockingbird
calls my name

rush hour train
so many
newspaper headlines

fallen palm branches
my father answers a question
i didn’t ask

happy hour
so many
unhappy faces

wondering
how the plastic heron
sees itself

summer dusk
a pelican’s plunge

between gated communities
florida rain

passing through security
a sandwich
of unknown composition

passing through security
waiting for the other
shoe to drop

awaiting departure
two dozen iphones

awaiting takeoff
the dow plummets

crime scene
muddy pawprints
on the pillow

flurries
a new
blood pressure med

equinox
monogrammed
hand towels

spring snow
a restless puppy

waiting room
i am not
a patient boy

first day of spring
too old to think about
how young she is

ungodlike behavior
stolen car getaway
and more

spring snow
a sudden urge
to hibernate

empty canvas
the art student’s
masterpiece

first day of spring
the old dog learns
a new trick

upscale pub
debutantes
ascending

home from the doctor
a blood orange
margarita

set on fire
i explode
inside of you

glass half empty
wading through
the snowmelt

hope springs eternal
no snow
in the forecast

filling out my taxes
i rob paul
to pay the piper

sweet sixteen
daffodils
in the snow

overcast
a rusty
swing set

restless sleep
a late-season
snow shower

spring thaw
extra ice
in my margarita

twilight
how slowly
it fades

twilight
my bloodshot eyes

hot prospect
her tight-fitting
baseball jersey

pink moon
the soundtrack
of my dream

pink moon
imagining
a new cocktail

waking from a dream
the crows
beyond the fog

squirrels!
a puppy
discovers spring

unable to sleep
unable to stay awake
a distant ocean

getting through
my spam filter
take a chance at love

town meeting
a mouse scratching
between the walls

good friday
extra spice
in my bloody mary

paying bills
my pen
runs dry

last call
counting the change
in the coffee can

barnstorming
a guitar
with three strings

easter sunday
the ghost of cesar chavez
in the produce aisle

opening day
the breathless crowd

unfinished
the builder’s house

he has risen!
but don’t bother him
until he’s had coffee

approaching storm
also known
as monday

april fool
the first one
in the door

april fool
an umbrella
turned inside-out

restless night
the puppy’s footsteps

in the waiting room
a stack of magazines
i won’t read

delta blues
a bead of sweat
that just won’t fall

trouble sleep
a distant
car alarm

signs of spring
her perky nipples

gunshots
two dogs
barking in the night

new moon
the rookie’s
first rbi

new moon
no one is surprised
that i have grandchildren

midnight
are we as drunk
as the drunks at the bar?

cliff’s edge
my retirement
portfolio

april wind
a tattered flag

opening day
a dog toy pressed
against my leg

opening day
adjusting my new
red sox cap

infield fly rule
a puppy
discovers geese

april dusk
wondering where
the dog has gone

opening day
the dog chases
a fly ball

opening day
her lips

asleep on the blue line
next stop wonderland

unable to sleep
unable to stay awake
the dog’s footsteps

cloudless sky
her eyes

cracking under the weight
of its branches
the old tree

dusk
our dog barks
at the neighbors

windows open
so many new sounds
for the puppy to bark at

at the end of the bar
a regular
at the end of his rope

at the end of the bar
a middle-aged couple
playing solitaire

south central rain
a girl
without a dream

starless night
a strikeout
with the bases loaded

starless night
a hanging curveball

pancakes!
a newborn colt
stretches his legs

loneliness
an ice cream truck
in the rain

moonrise
her shiny
engagement ring

april rain
an empty
beer bottle

under the lights
the rookie’s
spotless uniform

april rain
the dog’s
tattered chew toy

missing my deadline
the caffeine buzz
fades

weekend cocktail
my tropical beach
daydream

still pond
a duck paddles
through the sky

tax day
i lose a game
of solitaire

patriot’s day
a hunger strike
at guantanamo

patriot’s day
how easily
we hurt each other

sirens
sleeping
with one eye open

waxing moon
so tired of writing
sad poems

daydreaming
wildflowers
in bloom

waxing moon
another
sad haiku

flags at half-mast
a dead sparrow
on the sidewalk

april winds
a tattered flag

sudden chill
the names
of the deceased

waxing moon
i fall asleep
between commercials

howling wind
the dog
inches closer

lost for words
an empty
glass of wine

howling wind
the puppy’s ears

full of wine
the emptiness

heavy sigh
only so many hours
in a day

ominous skies
saving the good coffee
for another day

tough week
azalea blossoms
in the wind

reaching for
my red sox cap
the cloudless sky

two dogs
off leash
the cloudless sky

the old oak
mourning a cousin
i hardly knew

forget-me-nots
i put away
the snow shovels

spring sunset
through still bare trees
a fawn

planning my summer vacation
an empty bottle of tequila

moment of silence
gone
much too quickly

empty ferris wheel
the kiss
that wasn’t

burnt toast
the dog’s
muddy footprints

one year later
the faded
anti-war graffiti

pink moon
my daughter’s
daughters

snipping
the perfect rose
from our neighbor’s garden

pink moon
her lips

open mic
the singer’s
dark roots

taino village
an artist’s
conception

old photograph
my two-dimensional
youth

my investment portfolio
dogwood petals
on the ground

austin dive bar
the cowgirl’s
purple hair

sitting at my desk
i write about
the perfect day

express train
the service dog
sleeps

express train
the service dog
cat naps

in suburban silence
i dream of trains

recurring nightmare
the wind in the palms
is a passing train

unwelcome breeze
an out-of service train

fast asleep
in the corner
a 7th avenue local

the poet’s view
a mountain
of rejection letters

may day!
the puppy
discovers dandelions

understanding
my broken spanish
the dog

beachside bar
the waves
inside my head

elusive as sleep
my tropical dream home

weeds
growing
like weeds

five o’clock shadow
the dog
kisses me anyway

outsider art
nothing
painted blue

hanging curveball
i don’t remember
her name

hanging curveball
my turn
to walk the dog

weekend chores
the dog brings me
his leash

just when
i needed them
lilacs

may chill
longing for
a baja breeze

last of the limes
we’ll just have to drink
straight tequila

moonless night
our dog barks
at his own echo

morning fog
a tequila hangover

new moon
the dog rolls
in freshly cut grass

forever summer
the green monster
of my dreams

the dow soars
dandelion seeds
in the air

spring
the cruel flirt

outside the nursing home
an empty bird feeder

new moon
an empty
wine bottle

sideshow by the seashore
all the little girls
dressed as mermaids

thunder
cattle dogs
at play

high school reunion
ignoring the girls
who ignored me

ignoring my stare
a naked mannequin

lingering showers
the dog barks
at a toy

may showers
the secret behind
the ace’s curveball

finally friday
all the dogs
off leash

unseasonably warm
a smile
from a stranger

mid-day heat
a stray dog hunts
for shade

overcast
getting my news
from facebook

truth
a wicked
curve

darkening skies
only the mockingbird
still sings

donating blood
i clench and release
my fist

passing showers
wishing a happy mother’s day
to my daughters

burp!
the missing
beer

end of the weekend
my eyelids
at half-mast

end of the weekend
can everyone
hear my sighs?

fog
another
text message

staring at the mirror
my father’s frown
on my face

sunset
and we are
out of tequila

restless night
my stomach growls
at the dog

dead end
she asks
if i have a condom

rites of spring
explaining to the dog
that he can’t catch a bird

beans for dinner
but still
we blame the dog

now that i’m
drunk enough
i hear the waves

in the bullpen
a former ace
losing his grip

morning sun
the dog
takes a catnap

a poet’s dilemma
how many beers
in a haiku?

quiet pond
a frog
shatters the moon

hot date tonight
i pluck
my gray eyebrows

last of the coffee
time to face
the beautiful day

deep in thought
i cherry-pick
the fiddleheads

bad coffee
deadheading
the daffodils

new hope road
dead end

windless summer day
a dog barks
at the catbird

dusk
a chorus of boos
for the home team

the waitress’ scowl
when i ask
for something spicy

rain delay
the dog destroys
another toy

overcast morning
the dog
watches me shave

a sudden chill
where the weeping willow
used to be

this is the end
an open door

isolated showers
we lose
our internet

complaining
about the weather
until

lightning
her legs

my favorite song
i speed past
my exit

crows
chasing
the storm

chasing
the storm
crows

full of thunder
my dreams

moving day
the weight
of my memories

before
the storm
cocktails

mockingbirds
my retirement
portfolio

lingering rain
a scowl
from a stranger

darkening skies
my five o’clock shadow

lingering showers
the stock market
finishes flat

lingering showers
a puppy twitching
in his sleep

steady rain
and yet
the treefrogs

ignoring
the yellow light
in my dreams

visiting ground zero
i forget her name

unseasonably cold
reading my cousin’s
obituary

checkmate
her cleavage

memorial day
she doesn’t
recognize me

her name
a silent poem

dusk
a man in uniform
calls me sir

memorial day
explosions rock
my dreams

between
broken streetlights
the milky way

the glass half full
i meet
my son’s wife

warming trend
the dog sleeps
against my leg

dragonfly!
the puppy
sits

simmering heat
the countdown
to my son’s wedding

down port
the gulls
have no shadows

down port
the gulls
cast no shadows

stifling heat
the dog barks
at the ceiling fan

heat wave
the stock market
melts

my elementary school
now a nursing home

too hot to sleep
the dog’s breath

my quiet little street
where i zigged
instead of zagged

at the wake
his bad jokes
live on

heat wave
swearing that the air conditioners
get heavier each year

swearing
that the air conditioners
get heavier each year

muggy night
i google
my new daughter-in-law

a break in the weather
wild flowers
among weeds

ragweed
my faded jeans

where i used to play ball
an empty warehouse

a break in the clouds
the words
that fail me

too hot
to think about
how hot it is

closing my eyes
the hum
of the highway

storm in the forecast
i invent
a new cocktail

empty wine glass
sad that the storm
has passed

afternoon clouds
an old man swears
at my dog

starry night
my bucket list
half-empty

searching for meaning
in the sandpiper tracks

yes, their song
makes me smile
mourning doves

the homeless man’s
shiny compass

dead end street
i sense i’m being followed
on twitter

rough day on wall street
it’s the cheap wine tonight

electric night
the mosh pit
goes ten deep

writer’s block
shadows
on wall street

a gift
shadows
on wall street

churning in the gulf
my dreams

cool summer night
counting all the things
i don’t deserve

forgetting
what a forget-me-not
looks like

forgetting
what forget-me-nots
look like

adjusting
my portfolio
light rain

lingering rain
i catch myself
daydreaming

not on my bucket list
the freefall
i’m about to make

outside my front door
an indecisive sky

dogs at play
a break
in the clouds

clearing trend
her perfect skin

out of change
i consider
a political tweet

reflected
in a tired window
my past

note to self
big brother
is not family

blue sky
how quickly the subject turns
to baseball

not an open mic
my words on the lips
of a stranger

writer’s block
a broken fence

dive bar
the waitress’
faded tattoo

a haiku moment
the puppy discovers
bumblebees

lingering rain
a restless puppy

my aching back
tylenol
with a whiskey chaser

between empty seats
ironic applause

last of the wine
rain streams down
a cracked window pane

lopsided score
the conversation turns
to sex

light rain
my heavy heart

heavy sigh
fair skies
somewhere else

crescent moon
the dreams
of a tired puppy

strong headwind
my retirement portfolio

lingering clouds
a friend request
from a stranger

the dow drops
all those pennies
in the fountain

extra innings
finally feeling
the wine

clearing trend
a stranger’s smile

broken clouds
finally feeling
the coffee

the frown
i saved
for a rainy day

broken clouds
baiting
the rat traps

barefoot in the snow
my midsummer nightmare

full moon
the puppy finds
an old bone

writer’s block
something scratching
in the ceiling

bored puppy
barking
at twilight

a lonely place
so much water
under the bridge

funny
how the weather
reminds me of you

too hungover
to waste
bad coffee

feeling
the absence
of stars

restless night
something digging
through the dumpster

cloudless sky
out come
the sundresses

fast-moving storm
two puppies
at play

empty ferris wheel
the night
you said no

watching the rain
the puppy
and me

after the rain
i drank that wine
too fast

last call
now
she wants to dance

after the rain
we break out
the good wine

june swoon
wall street’s
tired song

waiting room
my unmatched socks

summer begins
my granddaughters’
matching dresses

tied ball game
i balance
my checkbook

outside the state house
pigeons fight for crumbs

a crumb falls
into her cleavage
i forget
the question

her cleavage
i forget
the question

today’s weather
sunny with a chance
of daydreaming

first weekend of the summer
i drink my beer
too quickly

first day of summer
a song i thought
i’d forgotten

one more beer
and the pike
becomes the ocean

baseball fantasy
her dress
high and tight

deep sigh
ripples
on the pond

longest day
the dog hunts
for shade

crossing the border
i still can’t
look her in the eye

baja morning
sweeping
the broken sidewalks

crossing the border
undeterred
full moon

mit dropouts
engineering
hangovers

strawberry moon
her nightgown
drops

flies
not dropping
like flies

tough loss
a dog’s toy
falls from the deck

swing and miss
mosquitoes

giant moon
one more year
without her

reflected
in your eyes
i seem so small

heat wave
dried flowers
beside the tombstone

heat wave
dead flowers
beside the tombstone

summer rain
our dog’s
favorite place

perfectly centered
between the seams
the pitcher’s autograph

falling
to the floor
her nightgown

overcast
counting
the days

lost
i navigate
her curves

softer
than summer rain
her kiss

cascading
down her neck
glistening pearls

waking
beneath a blanket
of fog

broken clouds
i dare not tell her
her dress is too tight

broken clouds
the dog
farts

bittersweet
encircling
a rusted swing set

windless day
the journeyman pitcher
cleans out his locker

sudden breeze
two lottery tickets
cross the street

drawing me closer
baja breeze

cool breeze
an unscratched
lottery ticket

kudzu
climbing
the walls

climbing
the walls
kudzu

waking from a nightmare
a persistent leak

after the rain
more rain

scattered showers
tripping over
another dog toy

missing her
oh to hear
the rain again

between innings
the puppy’s
soft fur

hours before dawn
the persistent chirping
of a smoke detector

independence day
a voluptuous woman
without a bra

revolution?
a backwards
baseball cap

unstable air
a sudden shift
in conversation

independence day
without makeup

fireworks
the intern’s
miniskirt

independence day
the dog
ignores my voice

independence day
my unshaved face

outside fenway
sausage vendors
talking trash

the look
on everyone’s face
five children?

not minding
the heat at all
dragonfly

insulting
the complimentary
beverage

noisy parents
noisily correcting
their noisy kids

summer vacation
the gypsy moth
moves in

stranger in a strange land
a noisy black bird

baja sunset
a dog on the roof
of the bodega

on the horizon
someone’s dream home
unfinished

game seven highlights
a blank screen

baja sunrise
interrupting
my jasmine dreams

before the storm
the deep dark stillness

baja midnight
a dog barks
at the rain

steady rain
wondering what the gecko
is laughing about

tropical gust
a shower
of hibiscus petals

reducing me
to a whisper
baja breeze

waking from a dream
waves crashing
on the shore

over coffee
an argument
among birds

morning fog
remembering the day
she died

lingering
a smile
from a stranger

lingering
her smile

stranger in a strange land
the cashier helps me
make change

mentioning her name
the wind dies

they say he has my eyes
the son who never calls

surfing
above the whitecaps
a lone pelican

past the midpoint
of our vacation
a mango falls

the old dog
too hot
to chase the rabbit

too hot
to chase
the rabbit

wave after wave
her hips

at the end
of the bar
the devil you know

voicemail
from the ex
a swollen tick

ripe plums
her lips

ocean breeze
i don’t care
what time it is

rising above
the new construction
crescent moon

scampering
into the bushes
the tomato thief

if only
for a moment
hummingbird

in the shade of the palapa
a bird builds its nest

new construction
a norteno ballad
with a techno beat

baja midnight
i forget the name
of the brightest star

the tilt-o-whirl
your eyes
so shiny

interrupting
the waves
my sigh

waiting for our luggage
lines and faces
grow longer

the final approach
trying to remember
if we left any beer

no justice
the mosquito
gets away

never fading
my son’s
crayon self-portrait

restless night
something scampering
across the arroyo

back home
the cobwebs
still in place

yes i do
feel more comfortable
when she wears
no bra

the ceiling fan hums
what else can you tell me
about the moon?

a mix
of sun and clouds
her smile

sangria
the taste
of her lips

lingering heat
the dog’s breath
against my leg

lingering heat
her eyes

yes you will find me
by my white hair

writer’s block
swatting
the same mosquito

writer’s block
mosquitoes

sangria
never quite
enough

sangria
the color
of her lipstick

too hot
to step on
unsuspecting ants

too hot
her windblown
sundress

this heat
the dog barks
at nothing

lamenting
her bad boy’s
bad behavior

guernica
we never
learn

heat wave
an empty
party boat

heat wave
i drank that margarita
much too fast

at the end of the bar
no reason
not to leave

too hot
to eat a hot dog
the hot dog

gun show
affordable caskets

cicadas
when one gets
to a certain age

his cancer returns
the smallness
of everything else

too hot
for metaphors

father’s day
laughing
at the same joke

family christmas
regifting
the gold turtleneck

green dots on a map
relief from this heat

distant thunder
rescue me
from this heat!

retirement dreams
mockingbirds

between skyscrapers
hay moon

a break in the heat
she adjusts
her shoulder strap

locusts
in tune with
my caffeine buzz

long-distance
explaining to my mother
what trip-hop is

break in the heat
my generous tip

starless night
may the best team
lose

warming trend
her strapless gown

wondering why
they call it
a swan song

after the storm
the puppy barks
at rain puddles

play ball!
your crooked smile

rising above
the barrio
the same moon

waiting for your call
i kill a fly

my fashion sense?
a mockingbird calls

do my faraway children
see the same lonely moon?

stormy morning
the dog
watches me shave

over morning coffee
the burned-out shell
of a city

rain delay
the dog barks
at his bone

rain delay
the dog barks
at a marrow bone

ruby red
her voluptuous lips

a long week
an extra hug
for the dog

ruby red
her lips

problem with binge drinking?
let it pour

lovers
exchange ear bites
at the dog park

long week
i step over
a scurrying ant

water lilies
prettier
than a painting

running uncontested
our dog the mayor

outdoor dining
her outside voice

forever seeking shade
on the sun-soaked beach
of my dreams

writer’s block
freshly-raked
beach sand

a startled puppy
unable to answer
the seagull

liquor connection
modern maternity

stopping traffic
her red miniskirt

morning mist
my mother corrects
the coffee maker

approaching thunder
the interns
giggle

between thunderstorms
the cat stretches

bottom of the ninth
her jersey
so tight

strike three
the beer i was saving
for the rally

running
the red light
newlyweds

tropical honeymoon
an iguana
stands guard

mercury rising
a text message
not intended for me

lunch hour
grass clippings
on the newlywed’s blouse

lunch hour
her tight blouse

trade deadline
the waning moon

tough day ahead
locusts

lost
on the road
not taken

stifling a yawn
grass goes to seed
in our garden

the new receptionist
another bouquet
of roses

grass goes to seed
it’s time to have that talk
about mom

extra innings
she’s not asleep
after all

rain delay
who is
the starting pitcher texting?

empty picnic table
what used to be

the quiet of night
a facebook invite
from a late friend

cover your ears!
the puppy
discovers cats

snow on the tv
too hot
to adjust the antenna

mostly sunny
i save most of my chores
’til tomorrow

mostly sunny
i save most of my chores
for tomorrow

hurricane season
in search of
a sunny disposition

august heat
the poblanos
ripen

summer dusk
a tired puppy
fighting sleep

for once in my life
dead man’s curve

politics
weeds
on the wind farm

new moon
i draw
a blank

the puppy
confused
by twins

no breeze
a great big bug
i don’t recognize

summer drought
my son’s voicemail box
is full

the awkward phase
i never grew out of

unamused
when i tell her
her bikini
is the bomb

moonless night
my youngest son’s
birthday

in my spam folder
email
from a late friend

new moon
she winks
at me

running out of words
the car stalls

our storm shelter
a well-stocked
wine cellar

new moon
what do puppies
dream about?

new moon
i fill
my glass

new moon
and yet
her eyes shine

the countdown
to regretting that tattoo
begins

not a cloud in the sky
the night
she left us

moonless night
the dog howls
anyway

moonless night
and yet
the locusts

summer breeze
there goes
my last nerve

summer mist
when it’s
almost gone

mosquitoes
what constitutes
a spirited discussion

unstable air
voicemail
from the ex

a bomber
named after mom
and the flash
below

summer nightmare
the drip
of an ice dam

bombs away
forever

smog moon
something lost

smog moon
i choose
a sad song

the last ferry
everyone wants to ride
on grandpa’s shoulders

love at first sight
the newest
dog toy

frozen in time
my granddaughter
eating ice cream

embracing
the dusk
my shadow

between meetings
the intermittent flicker
of a fluorescent light

speed trap
my heart races

passing the speed trap
my heartbeat
accelerates

all ears
the puppy

shooting star
the sparkle
in her eyes

speed trap
our first date

waking from a dream
hibiscus blossoms

between here
and oblivion
the cronut line

extra innings
that midnight smile

extra innings
the dog’s eyes
wide open

early morning
still tasting
the late night

one more year
no one tries
to guess my age

another year older
most of my to-do list

romantic dinner
our champagne glasses
touch

7th inning stretch
the dog
between naps

fighting sleep
the violent surf
of my dreams

writer’s block
an unfiltered ale

summer slump
a swarm
of gnats

high noon
i let the dog bark
at jehovah’s witnesses

bad mood
the cat’s tail

when i’m happy
i count
to ten

everything
there is to know about me
in these blank pages

waking from a dream
the dog’s
perky ears

end of the weekend
the dog’s nap
undisturbed

between meetings
the pizza
no one wants

tropical breeze
a daydream
of hibiscus blossoms

tropical daydream
hibiscus blossoms

my tropical dream
so many
fleeting breezes

remembering
who forgot
my birthday

leisurely walk
the dog’s fascination
with a skipped stone

skipping stones
the days
grow shorter

a tentative tail
the frightened dog
who wants to play

locusts
i finally
let go

waiting
for your call
hummingbird

windless night
a conclave
of ghosts

pulling in to work
the radio tells me
it’s a perfect beach day

cicadas
an email
from an old friend

old friends
cicadas

infield fly rule
a bored puppy

water spout
my next breath

robbed
by the walk-off
victory

baseball fantasy
her jersey
high and tight

the bitter rivalry
my grandchildren’s matching
red sox pajamas

business trip
i sleep on
her side of the bed

a dog’s life
lacking only
a place in the sun

even a lot
is never too much
hot sauce

summer’s last stand
her sundress

elvis fans parking
violators will be
all shook up

a new day
the dog rediscovers
a forgotten toy

happy hour
i settle in
for her life’s story

happy hour
her life’s story

peace treaty
a pair
of sleeping dogs

monday morning commute
a freshly-spun
spider web

tropical storm
i can’t find
my sandals

years later
the same
icy glare

summer breeze
she never told me
her name

summer dusk
a sleeping puppy

summer dusk
she knows
when i’ve left the room

even as she sleeps
she knows
when i’ve left the room

the silence
when the rain
doesn’t come

summer dusk
the color of the beer
i just finished

when did we grow tired
of our tired
and our poor?

visitation rites
dad parks
around the corner

summer haze
two days’ growth
of beard

summer haze
cicadas

downtown crossing
the weekend exchange
of the kids

summer haze
the puppy sleeps

cool summer night
i don’t remember
growing older

summer’s end
never seem
to find the time

waning moon
the cute puppy
finds a home

sabre dance
the lust
for war

happiness
a tired puppy

double play
her low-cut
baseball jersey

the conversation
i never had
with grandpa

peace
between the drum beats
of war

the prospect
watching veterans
spit tobacco

september
the smell
of my sandals

living
between flashes
of lightning

over coffee
wondering how
he lost
the strike zone

wondering how
the ace reliever
lost his grip

thunder
a distant
car alarm

approaching storm
the stillness
of the palapa

the cruel flirt!
sun peeking
between clouds

intersecting
with my rage
back-to-school shoppers

after the rain
shoppers pour out
of the mall

labor day
is it time
for a nap?

around the fire
the summer’s
last ghost story

end of a holiday weekend
just one more firefly

windless night
a distant freight train

clouds
looming
beyond the rhetoric

crawling across
the priceless mosaic
a house fly

escalator down
the case
for war

war drums
out of sync

congressional debate
a pigeon puffs out
his chest feathers

the storm
that stays away
in my dreams

los viejos argue
about whose mofongo
is better

washington gridlock
lane closures
right and left

tropical depression
the last days
of summer

this bitter wine
the color of the line
no one drew

september baseball
the dog
and me

bases loaded
and out
of wine

bumper to bumper
i don’t care about
your honor student

crystal clear
your fuzzy excuses

crystal clear
this is where
i belong

first frost
another road
not taken

first beer
of the weekend
faraway geese

september chill
the dog won’t
eat his dinner

grandpa’s birthplace
a city
of walls

blue sky blues
knowing
it can’t last

gray sky
i crush
an ant

killing frost
a part of me
also dies

fever dream
waving the foul ball
fair

writer’s block
a curveball
in the dirt

waxing moon
the nights
grow longer

fever dream
a distant train

empty subway car
the accountant’s
broken calculator

cool september night
the puppy rediscovers
an old toy

the war
to end all wars
never ends

war
sometimes you just need
to run away

summer’s end
a hurried
goodbye

after the rain
we wonder where
the rain has gone

work dream
how i dream
of not working

swing and a miss
the long walk home

september
so hard
to see her go

after the meeting
a swarm of gnats

thunder
a dream
about the towers

waiting for the train
the pretty woman’s
ugly scowl

swing and a miss
her ponytail
unfurls

weary morning
the last slice
of day-old cake

gone
before last call
the last train

friday the 13th
awakened
by crows

september rain
a puppy scratching
at the door

windy city
our taxi driver
opens the windows

behind the bar
a collage
of faded photos

above the skyscrapers
whispers of war

above the highest
skyscrapers
mezcal dreams

last call
who’s going to bounce
the bouncers

across the bar
do they think we look as drunk
as we think they do?

eyes like almonds
i forget
the next

cry of independence
moving
to higher ground

gourmet fundraiser
foodies
pontificating

street musicians singing
in the key of rain

travel day
the shoes
i never wear

back to work
a day
of unmatched parentheses

back to work
unmatched
parentheses

nighttime walk
i reason
with the dog

empty nest
the shadows
lengthen

empty nest
i fill
my glass

equinox
her perfect
breasts

over the hill
no longer
a destination

gun debate
the baristas stop talking
when he comes in

harvest moon
wondering what the dog
is eating

wall street rally
still the squirrels
gather acorns

harvest moon
falling acorns

blue moon
september baseball
that matters

harvest moon
an empty
conference room

end of summer
the dog naps
on the picnic table

clinching the playoffs
another acorn falls

last weekend
of summer
a sleeping dog

last day of summer
one less seagull
at the dump

news from overseas
i remind myself
to breathe

last day of summer
the chili peppers
shiver

first day of fall
sharing my pillow
with the dog

after the flood
a girl
without a dream

after the flood
dreamless sleep

first day of fall
the palm-lined malecón
of my dreams

northern lights
an approaching train

first day of fall
the glowing embers
of your eyes

equinox
a final
embrace

dive bar
the taste of lipstick
in my beer

dive bar
lipstick
on my pint glass

after the storm
a dog barking
at the silence

empty wine glass
she tells me
not to worry

in a wrinkled photograph
my unwrinkled face

breaking bad
a rogue wave

the deep silence
between sighs

right on time
an out-of-service train

no strings attached
she said
with a wink

september dusk
a rusty
swing set

dusk
a rusty
swing set

always too soon
autumn

september dusk
a photo
of our late dog

also pale
the autumn sky

missing the train
my wrinkled hands

the doctor assures me
it’s only an age spot

burning my tongue
on bad coffee
i remember you

trying not
to exaggerate my pain
i bite my tongue

no longer lost
i unfollow you

at the courthouse
i judge
my fellow jurors

crescent moon
the dog doesn’t see
the rabbit

new moon
meaningful baseball
in october

above the treetops
a child’s
red balloon

september fog
wondering where
summer went

september fog
wondering where
september went

new england fog
baseball season ends

glittering in the sun
a broken whiskey bottle

washington gridlock
all minds closed

tomorrow’s news
a spent
shotgun shell

shorter days
an email to a friend
bounces

the dust settles
finding myself
unfriended

last day of september
my baseball glove
where it was last year

unseasonably mild
a freshly erased
whiteboard

ready to launch
a boat
without a rudder

writer’s block
a rudderless boat

who to blame?
the dog twitches
in his sleep

with leftovers
a rerun of a show
i don’t even like

bulerías
the flamenco guitarist’s
dangling cigarette

october warm-up
her bare shoulders

longer nights
the tequila
wears off

hot night
she’s not
sleeping either

after the storm
the palapero
sighs

a stranger
invites me
to like her

october warm-up
and yet the squirrels
gather acorns

his enemies
paying their last
and only respects

mispronouncing my last name
the doctor’s cold stethoscope

october
the changing color
of my disposition

a day off
and yet i walk the dog
in the rain

still not turning up
in lost and found
my patience

my patience
still not turning up
in lost and found

no end in sight
her cleavage

writer’s block
the smile on a kite
turned upside-down

falling leaves
the dog’s ear
twitches

what playoffs?
a dog nap
is always in season

shutting the windows
the ocean breeze
of my dreams

last call
amplifier
feedback

moonlight
stepping over
her nightgown

overcast
and yet too tired
to make more coffee

too tired
to make
more coffee

killing time
i wonder
where the time went

too clever
to be
myself

scratching behind the wall
an uninvited guest

soft drinks inside
toilet

writer’s block
an empty
industrial park

anti-war graffiti
covered
with white paint

friendly
until she notices
the ring

amber sky
i forgot
to buy beer

cold and lonely night
a faint norteno ballad

wondering
if i should tell her
that i always hear music
in my head

suburban lullaby
an idling
delivery truck

first date
an idling
delivery truck

where i long to be
a catalonian lullaby

closing the storm windows
my ocean dreams

old diary
unable to read
my handwriting

she won’t tell
where the flowers
came from

freshly-fallen pine needles
the dog
investigates

october dog walk
each pine cone
a mystery

harvest moon
a broken promise

fall color
her spiked hair

putting away
the air conditioner
i listen for the ocean

finally drunk enough
to remember
my favorite song

found
the invitation
to last week’s party

through the mist
a howling dog

haunted
by the soft eyes
of a shelter dog

now boarding
the conductor’s
creepy birthmark

fighting motion sickness
i remember you

the train ride too rough
to dream of palm trees

standing room only
she knows
she’s rubbing against me

fighting sleep
an abandoned factory

getting closer
broken glass
meets fresh graffiti

brooklyn revisited
all the pretty hipsters
drunker than me

line to the ladies’ room
all of the pretty
flower tattoos

interrupting
my tropical daydream
the skyscraper’s reflection

columbus day
rats and politicians
on the job

throbbing disco
tomorrow’s hangover

unable to sleep
unable to stay awake
a distant car alarm

sleepless night
the street sweeper
block by block

the old neighborhood
a dog
tied to a lamp post

midtown pizzeria
a norteno ballad
in the kitchen

one cocktail too many
the ocean
in my head

wall street bar
a tense negotiation
over mergers and acquisitions

hotel lounge
searching for the meaning
in the bar snacks

searching
for the meaning
in the bar snacks

is she drunk enough
to leave
with the drunk?

torn between
two losers
the barfly

foreplay
opinions
over cocktails

bryant park
a megaphone tells me
i’m going to hell

always too early
sunset

harvest moon
i collect
a urine sample

always too soon
sunset

high-speed train
she can’t believe
how old we are

minutes from home
i finally win
at solitaire

dusk
he calls my sons
estranged

whispering i love you
a coconut falls

harvest moon
the dog digs up
an old bone

writer’s block
leaves clinging
to a dead tree

realizing
that it isn’t the geese
going the wrong way

hunter’s moon
i forget
the question

carpet bombing
the puppy’s
little accident

stepping into the cockpit
of a bomber
named after mom

restless night
a rooster crowing
in my dreams

loneliness
the last
clinging leaf

searching for words
an acorn falls

waking from a dream
dust floating
in sunlight

a forgotten dream
dust floating
in sunlight

dreaming of retirement
fallen leaves

the road not taken
i think i zigged
where i should have zagged

email
from a former friend
a bloated tick

scribbling
the great american novel
on a bar napkin

on second thought
i erase
her phone number

never quite finished
the carpenter’s house

one week before halloween
i shop for ghosts

times square
tourists in search
of the naked cowboy

his last words
pencil me in

sudden chill
a headline
from my daughter’s town

old faithful
a water main break
at a crowded intersection

just like last year
more halloween candy
than we need

leaving the craps table
baby still needs
a pair of shoes

finally friday
and no one returns
my phone calls

frost warning
alone
together

on the back
of a rejection letter
my next haiku

cold snap
staring at
strike three

october breeze
swing
and a miss

low and outside
the opening monologue

rug shopping
the salesman’s
cheap toupee

even the dog
won’t eat
the zucchini bread

firm yet broken
the carpenter’s handshake

late october
the rookie’s
peach fuzz

killing frost
a broken bat

found
in the dog’s crate
my favorite slippers

remember me,
winter jacket?

falling temperatures
these whispering
pines

devil’s night
i ignore
the telephone

devil’s night
ignoring
the telephone

devil’s night
a wicked curveball

halloween morning
the devil serves me
a runny egg

feeling her squeeze my hand
i suddenly like
horror movies

day of the dead
broken tree limbs
in the road

day of the dead
all the leftover
halloween candy

all soul’s day
an old man
feeding sparrows

november rain
the dog and i
pacing

unseasonably warm
her bare shoulders

election week
the flag hangs
limply

raw autumn day
a sudden craving
for sushi

threat of snow
wondering where
all the rum went

suburban gridlock
the kamikaze school bus
floors it

world series parade
through the right neighborhoods

reviewing
my meeting schedule
i stifle a yawn

turning back the clock
i still feel older

between skyscrapers
shadows
with wings

an inconspicuous sliver
the moon
and me

between meetings
another cup
of bad coffee

losing at solitaire
the high point
of my day

serving up a cocktail
the waitress
calls me sugar

suburban gridlock
the perky girl
on the treadmill

stock market report
a stalled car
in the intersection

screaming
at the night
an ambulance

house lights dimmed
she dances
alone

flickering streetlight
have i missed
the last train?

her caress
more tender
than grandma’s meatloaf

in a corner
of the funeral parlor
old friends compare
fantasy football scores

threat of snow
researching
cocktail recipes

dive bar
a pile of
spent lotto sheets

town landfill
old timers
arguing politics

always busy
the autumn squirrel

asleep in the sun
the puppy’s nose
on high alert

the dog’s favorite
spot on the couch
between us

dive bar
a regular claims
to recognize me

the moon
and my wine glass
half full

autumn wind
the window washer’s
dangling ropes

hunter’s moon
searching
for my keys

crows
a rotting oak

snow in the forecast
the dog’s head
on my lap

first snow
an almost
perfect shave

cold night
i become
the dog’s pillow

fair-weather clouds
an ultrasound
of my next grandchild

deep freeze
the dog naps
next to the oven

summer flashback
a puppy chasing
the lawn sprinkler

so in love
with that song
i miss my exit

my favorite bathrobe
never looked this good
when i wore it

between parentheses
where you belong

between parentheses
where i belong

full moon
an empty pint
of ice cream

alarmed
by one another
the crows
and me

should i tell these mosquitoes
that winter is near?

always too soon
christmas lights

a heavy sigh
the dog toy pressed
against my leg

overcast night
searching for
the hunter’s moon

over the good tequila
my darkest secrets

suburban gridlock
two mercedes
lock horns

darkening skies
the final hours
of the weekend

caught in the act
her fishnet stockings

over crushed ice
my darkest secrets

unseasonably mild
the politician’s
concession speech

rip tide
not the getaway
i hoped for

cold snap
longing
for fog

fog
a distant train

look at me
and then ask
if i care
what’s trending
on twitter

when no one is looking
i catch a snowflake
with my tongue

as well he should
the puppy barks
at the first snowflakes

late autumn
the dead oak
at ease

restless sleep
the rhythm
of the train

choice seat at the bar
the keg kicks
on my favorite beer

waning moon
the dog’s
sad eyes

a cold day in dallas
or so i remember

draining
my wine glass
the sun sets

a cold day in dallas
or so they tell me

i wonder where he’s gone
my little acorn hunter

explaining to my mother
what venus in furs
is about

walking our dogs
the conversations
turn to work

ass fragrance
buy one
get one free

startled from sleep
the elevated green line
of my dreams

always waiting for me
the night

backing into the parking lot
a flatbed filled
with christmas trees

startled from sleep
the sleet
against my window

finishing a beer
the dog fast asleep
in my lap

howling wind
the dog who doesn’t
want to play

i know but don’t believe
it can’t be
too cold to snow

wind chill advisory
the website
unavailable

an alarm clock
on the other side
of my nightmare

plucking the turkey
a sudden craving
for tofu

tearing a page
from my notebook
she spits out her gum

sleet
it even sounds cold

rough weather ahead
a last-minute meeting

november rain
the dog steals a sock
from the hamper

too tired to care
muddy paw prints
on the bedspread

november rain
a broken umbrella

thankful
starbucks doesn’t care
it’s thanksgiving

thanksgiving morning
scouring the convenience stores
for day-old cake

backstage
all the names
we drop

black friday
already tired
of christmas music

riding the elevator with me
a cheap perfume

4-day weekend
i spare
a winter moth

smoke from a chimney
a sudden craving
for mezcal

remembering
when these rowdy kids
were mine

remembering
when all those rowdy kids
were mine

reminding my mother
that my wife of 15 years
doesn’t eat beef

avoiding eye contact
with the celebrity
ordering deli meat

avoiding eye contact
with the celebrity
at the deli counter

not sure how i feel
about all the tourists posing
at the finish line

last day of november
the bartender doesn’t
have to ask

silence
a frozen sigh

between nightmares
a mass pike serenade

our first kiss
the slow arc
of a shooting star

mixed precipitation
i go to work
with unmatched socks

mixed precipitation
unmatched socks

december fog
an unfamiliar intersection

december fog
a familiar intersection
behind me

energy dip
the case
for bad coffee

what goes well
with bad coffee?
an energy dip

harvard square
an expensive replica
of a dive bar

december overcast
the dog’s
exuberant greeting

red light
a biker shouts
nice dog

for rent
the fortune teller’s kiosk

love is telling her
the dog is smiling

broken clouds
something
i’d forgotten

a smile on the blue line
next stop, wonderland

wonderland
the end
of the line

frost on the windshield
she never gave me
the time of day

the jagged edge
of last year’s
ice scraper

crescent moon
someplace
i’d rather be

does buddha know
that he is covered
with frost?

skipping breakfast
something smoking
on the warming tray

morning meditation
smoke rising
from the warming tray

winter overcast
one meeting slips
into the next

snow in the forecast
i wake
before the alarm

unseasonably warm
i notice
her curves

tattered jeans
hugging her
oh so tight

hugging her
oh so tight
tattered jeans

after the storm
rainbows
in a puddle

restless night
the mass pike
and me

winter rain
the dog’s
nose print

that blouse
waiting for the button
to pop

white lies
rain turns
to snow

from 30,000 feet
so many glittering
baseball diamonds

discovering a diamond
with my tongue

what secrets
lie behind
these ruined walls?

stirred from sleep
whose lipstick
do i taste?

she tells me
there’s one more tattoo
i haven’t seen

construction zone
drinking wine
from a coffee mug

an ice event
my exwife using
her maiden name

power failure
still waiting
for the walk signal

snow in the forecast
an empty page
in my haiku notebook

funeral mass
my five o’clock shadow

between meetings
a slow procession
of clouds

winter storm watch
the puppy barks
at falling snowflakes

winter storm watch
an optimistic
snow plow

late for work
i swerve to avoid
the dead squirrel

nobody tells me
the bus doesn’t
stop here any more

hometown library
the cobwebs
still in place

first snow
the dog wants
another bone

winter warmer
her playful wink

winter daydream
imagining the warmth
beneath her sweater

blind date
somehow she can’t resist
tweeting

play at the plate
the last
christmas cookie

snow in the forecast
wall street
runs for cover

after all this time
the immovable object
is me

winter sun
i throw a snowball
at my shadow

winter storm warning
a three bean salad

silent night
snow on the shoulders
of buddha

approaching storm
rearranging
the poetry magnets

snow flurries
my unborn granddaughter’s
heartbeat

caught up in the thorns
the season’s first snowfall

light snowfall
a sleeping puppy

restless night
the snow plow’s
rusty chains

digging out
in search of
my winter gloves

last set
a half-filled whiskey bottle
on the organ

her lips
beckoning mine
highway billboard

over scrambled eggs
i re-balance
my portfolio

so tired
of writing
about snow

hidden
beneath the snow
peace on earth

single-digit temperatures
i keep counting
my fingers

chance of snow
stock futures
up in the air

yankee swap
her favorite player
in pinstripes

startled from sleep
i forgot
to press send

lost
another race
against the sun

one week before christmas
all the pretty brake lights

make-up sex
i forget
everything

dirty snow
he uses the word
estranged

on the back of a christmas card
my absent-minded doodling

waiting
beneath the christmas tree
a smile and a wink

one beer later
i awaken
to infomercials

outgunned
the barmaid’s
biceps

cold coffee
the crunch of a christmas ball
under foot

melting snow
she walks on by

winter solstice
short-changed
at the liquor store

longest night
another call
gone to voicemail

solstice
my asymmetrical
eyebrows

dusting off
the christmas lights
gibbous moon

back on the truck
unsold christmas trees

christmas daze
a domestic disturbance
in the toy store

between christmas carols
a car alarm

cold front
phone call
from the ex

december rain
please play me
a sad song

inventor
of the ak-47
dies of old age

hungry
for what’s beneath
her spaghetti straps

not reassured
it’s only
an age spot

not reassured to learn
it’s only an age spot

nowhere near the mistletoe
a sloppy kiss
from the dog

nowhere near
the mistletoe
a kiss from the dog

christmas eve
a mouse
sets off the trap

writer’s block
a snowman
without a face

loneliness
an empty
stretch of highway

mud beneath the snowmelt
a call from the ex

christmas chill
some assembly required

infinite
all the stars
whose names i’ve forgotten

dusting of snow
i haven’t
moved

moving day
the dog chases
dust bunnies

crescent moon
mom’s christmas cookies

dusting off
an old photograph
doesn’t make me younger

ankle deep in slush
i crave
a frozen margarita

daydreaming
an abandoned
train station

crescent moon
the dog sleeps
with one eye open

all that’s left
a dead tree

new moon
i notice
her curves

first date
trying not to talk
to her cleavage

an unexpected smile
the subway doors
close

perusing facebook
wondering when our relationship
got complicated

in the quiet of morning
a bird’s nest
full of snow

dense fog
i’ve forgotten
her name

dense fog
a forgotten dream

brushing the hair
from her face
i want her
again

last train gone
the streetlight
stops flickering

tonight’s forecast
homemade chili

december rain
wondering where
the sparrows are

obituary
for an uncle
i hardly knew

abandoned playground
the graffiti
fades

unable to sleep
an abandoned hotel

approaching cold front
my cousin’s obituary

windless afternoon
an energy dip

the blank page
learning nothing
from the pine

new year’s eve
recycled resolutions

suburban new year
recycled resolutions

new moon
i forget
old acquaintances

no one asks
shopping cart man
how his christmas was

new year’s eve
the dog also waits
for the ball to drop

new year’s day
washing down my aspirin
with flat champagne

new year’s day
the ventilator
silent

bowl games
the dog begs
for table scraps

upscale mall
socialites
ascending

between resolutions
about ten pounds

as the snow falls
so falls
the dow

the joyful noise
of the snow plow
on my street

cactus flower
daydreaming
the snow away

white hair and all
his crayon portrait
of grandpa

cardinal
on a snowy tree limb
the stillness

wagging his tail
innocently
the sock thief

white-out
i forget
what an azalea
looks like

a hawk’s cry
who watches
the watchers?

summer breeze
she whispers
take me from behind

throwing a snowball
at my shadow

congress on recess
the dog
chases snowballs

winter hike
imagining
it’s all a dream

sold
to pay off debts
the peace abbey

fever dream
palm branches
peeking through snow

winter fog
the long way home
from nyquil

plunging temperatures
i dream
of plunging necklines

deep winter
a long dark goodbye

i almost forgot
the smile
that made me forget
everything

record cold
unprecedented
hyperbole

all of our
best-made plans
a dusting of snow

deep freeze
my heating bill

dim the lights
rum
from an unlabeled bottle

rebel rebel
i don’t wait
for the walk sign

bitter wind
the dog
huddles closer

warming trend
imagining
her naked

warming trend
a cask-conditioned ale

warming trend
we break out
the good wine

warming trend
pitchers and catchers report
in 37 days

northern lights
an idling truck

my favorite song
a sea breeze
in the palms

continued cold
another person tells me why
i should like whiskey

lovers’ quarrel
the call
of a mockingbird

crowded train
her body language
obscene

crowded train
a clash
of perfumes

too tired to move
freezing drizzle

warming trend
an unscratched
lottery ticket

mid-winter thaw
an unscratched
lottery ticket

we disagree
steam rising from a mound
of dirty snow

winter rain
giving up
the last word

abandoned at the curb
a brown christmas tree

news from my home town
a hawk circles above

playoff time
a new dog
at the beach

january
another brand new track suit
jogs by

knowing
i can quit any time
i don’t

working late
my reflection
turns black

mired in mud
the dow

between
telephone poles
sunset

winter rain
you were rather handsome
back in the day

winter rain
being told
i clean up well

wolf moon
tossing and turning
through the night

autumn wind
the dog guards
a fallen acorn

ice on the windshield
a fear that
i’ve forgotten something

whites only
the broken
washing machine

wolf moon
the sway
of her hips

winter fog
a dead friend
wants to link in

winter fog
the absent
moon

above the fog
wolf moon

weekend countdown
a song i don’t like
at full volume

ice on the windshield
the countdown
to happy hour

scattered clouds
a toast
to absent friends

abandoned at the gate
a still-warm
cup of coffee

at an empty gate
headline news
for ghosts

empty terminal
headline news
for ghosts

a ring
for my first love
returned

departure lounge
staring at
my marginal coffee

on-time departure
another one-night stand

baja midnight
even earlier
than i remembered

a surfer and his board
just appreciating
the waves

san pedrito surf break
my first sigh
of the year

baja back-road
i suddenly remember
what a culvert is

baja sunset
i stop fussing
with the camera

baja sunrise
the puppy barks
at a crashing wave

pescadero morning
the gardener
rakes his shadow

fair-weather clouds
a pair of hawks
circling

catching a wave
the one
who had me at hello

baja night
the tequila and i
reposado

surf break
all that matters
is the next wave

low tide
seaweed
between the rocks

wave after wave
the contours
of your body

rip tide
dogs chasing a four-wheeler
on the beach

yoga on the beach
a dog squats to poop

surf’s up!
an old dog
crying on the beach

covering
her tribal tattoo
a gucci handbag

the heat of day
old woman lining up
for the fish truck

my plans?
stars
against a pale sky

under a transplanted palm
the carpenter’s rv

surf’s up!
an unanswered
telephone

free wifi
how many espressos
to upload a file?

surf break
even buddha awaits
the perfect wave

my recurring nightmare
i can’t take my eyes off
the drowning man

last day in baja
remembering winter
my back aches

last of the tequila
never enough time
to drink it all in

the dow falls
an old dog sleeping
in the shade

on top
she calls me
baby

unable to sleep
unable to stay awake
the restless tide

preparing for take-off
i locate the babies
and the nearest exit

after the storm
a fly
in a champagne glass

undisturbed
that the surf band
is from a landlocked city

gone too soon
the palm trees
in my mirror

working late
i rehearse
my apology

unapologetic
her vulgar tattoo

unapologetic
her daring cleavage

always on time
the end
of the weekend

a reverent hush
the lion sleeps tonight

off night
the bartender
paces

single-digit temperatures
her finger
in my face

state of the union
whose snoring
is louder?

light snow
my daughter’s
first gray hair

moonshine
washing away
my sins

most capable
of running this country
undecided

finally
earning my vote
undecided

heat of day
a bicycle rests
against the fence

cold night
an oil truck idles
at the donut shop

pay day
i corner
the mosquito

pouring the champagne
i hear
a distant ocean

lonely night
the weight
of my dog’s ashes

state of the union
a passing garbage truck

lonely night
my dog’s ashes

in a dark corner
of the juke joint
a broken banjo

super bowl eve
a hail mary pass
at the end of the bar

super bowl sunday
a dog shreds
the tennis ball

sibling rivalry
puppies at play

groundhog day
the puppy barks
at his shadow

winter storm watch
beware of falling
stock prices

fresh snowfall
pitchers and catchers report
in twelve days

a strong cocktail
because there’s no band-aid
for wall street

one to two inches
of partly cloudy

black ice
something
i’m forgetting

finally he sleeps
the sneaker thief

stifling a yawn
the last of the coffee
down the drain

trying to forget
the first time i saw
my father cry

dusk
the emptiness
begins

fresh snow
trying not to write
the same old poem

pot hole
a bumpy ride
on wall street

writer’s block
muddy footprints
in the snow

how many empty bottles
until i hear
the ocean?

man-made pond
the frogs
unimpressed

battery park
i point to where
the towers stood

curious
how i’ve lost weight
in old photos

continued cold
a recording reminds me
of an upcoming appointment

sunset
my mother asks me
again

never welcome
the idling snow plow

the opportunity
of a lifetime
in my spam box

spring training
the snow shovel
on deck

writer’s block
the last
parking space

a new rose
that extra bounce
in her step

a voluptuous woman
an extra bounce
in my step

cold coffee
deciding which
bad check to write

behind locked doors
the roses
i meant to buy

describing my day
the dog yawns

a dozen roses
the dog’s tail
begins to wag

flattered
that she doesn’t believe
i’m a grandfather

wondering
if back ache
is a winter kigo

reading my palm
she tells me
i have no life

too much coffee
the silence
hums

a dusting of snow
the dog
climbs into our bed

spilling the beans
one facebook post
too many

dirty snow
an exgirlfriend’s
nasty tweet

deep winter
an empty jar
of dog biscuits

bitter cold
a friend
unfriends me

cold coffee
the meeting
that won’t end

hunger moon
my stomach growls

hunger moon
an entirely rational fear
of snow plows

surf break
buddha awaits
the perfect wave

winter storm warning
a limited
wine selection

snow moon
a birthday reminder
for a dead friend

now available on kindle
the book i never wrote

working from home
the dog sleeps
with one eye open

finally old enough
to take baby aspirin

an unanswered phone
snow turns to rain
and back again

hunger moon
the next-door neighbor
puts away his snow blower

i meant every word
of the letter
i never sent to you

the ides of march
my aching back
betrays me

a dozen roses
for just one kiss

snow moon
she won’t tell me
where the flowers came from

talking about
our old dog
our new dog
sleeps

winter overcast
the busker
counts his change

skyscraper shadows
the wail
of a saxophone

skyscraper shadows
the tarnished brass
of a busker’s sax

deep winter
the plows
fall silent

snow day
bicycle couriers
comparing tattoos

not retirement
the veteran pitcher’s
tattered glove

freshly shaved
the snow plow
speeds past

no longer alone
in the lingerie section
the music stops

does she know that i know
that this is yesterday’s bagel?

letting go
of yesterday’s snow
a dying oak

yesterday’s snow
a dying oak

crows
the embers
of a campfire

plaza mayor
the slap
of a skateboard

writer’s block
snow
on top of snow

snow day
a new bottle
of hot sauce

snowbound
the dog barks
at the sky

a long winter
trash
in the donation jar

ordering another drink
the barmaid
calls me baby

gymnopédies
life is but
a flickering shadow

three weeks ’til payday
the mouse trap
empty

melting snow
my email
marked as junk

the beautiful sound
of snowmelt
in the gutters

a random snowflake
remembering
my first published haiku

shutttered cafe
an abandoned flag
in independence square

caracas
open market
closed indefinitely

winter fog
a burned-out tank
in the intersection

flowers in her hair
her sign reads
they are killing us

winter fog
another wall street rally
fades

sorting recyclables
two old-timers
talk politics

brushing back her purple hair
the farmer’s daughter’s
rugged hands

spring training begins
i search for the seams
on a snowball

filing my taxes
the leaking faucet
i never fix

columbus day
i discover
a hornet’s nest

deep winter
so many shades
of overcast

deep winter
how many shades
of overcast

picking at the scab
of my barely suppressed rage

empty boat
my thoughts
adrift

false spring
a frisbee sails
over the fence

death of a clown
i pour out
the rest of the wine

waking from a dream
the last ferry
sounds its horn

restless night
the sound of
too much silence

wildflowers
my granddaughters’
braided hair

spring in the air
a towering pop fly

restless night
the homebrew
ferments

last call
a regular gesturing
to cobwebs

off night
the guitarist plays through
a broken string

the former pornstar
picks up her own pizza

closing time
no i’m not
a regular

before i can apprehend
the misfortune of others
i change the channel

his elevator pitch
pressing all
the wrong buttons

wind chill advisory
a parking ticket
on my windshield

new moon
nothing but
empty sky

starless night
an unfinished bridge

unable to skip a stone
on the water
under the bridge

twilight
the painkillers
kick in

new moon
rewriting
the same old poem

page not found
my words lost
in the cloud

writer’s block
a sheet of ice
on the sidewalk

driftwood
my darkest
secrets

dusk
a photo of my old dog
as a puppy

new moon
that one tattoo
i haven’t seen

waking from a dream
before the ghosts
can serve me coffee

how does the gull celebrate
this glorious sunrise?

empty nest
not quite sure
what i expected

new day
a wisp
of chimney smoke

oscar night
the grandkids
act up

winter overcast
the cold meds
kick in

rolling the dice
two limes
in my margarita

crescent moon
the advancing army’s
ultimatum

the cabbie’s story
so captivating
we miss my exit

fat tuesday
i ask for
the real butter

no one told me
i couldn’t count
every star

slow internet
the compost barrel
frozen shut

opening the champagne
i can almost
hear the ocean

dockside bar
how long until
i see mermaids?

ash wednesday
smokers huddle
with their heads bowed

my daily affirmation
a dog pissing
against the snowbank

grandpa’s pipe
the sizzle
of sofrito

i tell her
it’s not cheating
to count flower petals

a homeless man asks me
what i’ve given up
for lent

reaching for the remote
you touch my hand

daylight savings
the dog runs away
with the ball

spring cleaning
i crop her out
of the photograph

winter sunset
a quick peek
at the obituaries

does she know
i’m visualizing
her wardrobe malfunction?

dreamless sleep
the ice
beneath the snow

lost
the star
i named after you

you say sunrise
i say sunset
and finish my tea

the twinkle in his eye
when i ask for
the good tequila

at the end
of a quiet street
an unplowed driveway

one spring closer
to discarding
her scarf

another nightmare
surrendering
to the undertow

i want to be the one to tell her
that the last train is gone

who knew
all the straws
were short?

spring in the air
a nearby
sneezing fit

a gutted cafe
now serving
molotov cocktails

bad coffee
unconvinced
that i’m saving daylight

sick of vampire movies
i go heavy
on the garlic

my shadow lengthens
into haiku cliché

spring rain
tracing the letters
on a tombstone

unseasonably mild
and fresh out
of hot sauce

the dow drops
reheating
yesterday’s coffee

winter warm-up
the moths
don’t even bother

the awkward silence
when she asks me
to say grace

heartbroken
a receding wave

construction site
a little girl’s
origami crane

writer’s block
trash beneath
the snow pile

fresh snow
the same old me
in the mirror

a windsurfer capsizes
i order my eggs
over easy

email from a late friend
in my spam folder

stuck in a rut
i turn off
the engine

late season snow
the plows
also stay home

wall street collapses
under two inches
of snow

winter wind
the dog curls up
next to me

winter wind
the dog curls up
between us

jetway receding
a baby screams over
the safety instructions

cruising altitude
a complimentary
cocktail

broken clouds
my morning cocktail
fades

high above
a barrier island
i remember you

broken clouds
my father resumes the conversation
we weren’t having

batter up!
everything old
is new again

the ides of march
two pitchers warming up
in the bullpen

starless night
you know
your mother is slowing down

full worm moon
a stranger asks
where will you spend eternity?

purring in his sleep
oh, to have the dreams
of a cat

a moment of silence
learning that grandpa
was a yankee fan

somewhere
beneath the snowdrift
a four-leaf clover

salamander
chasing
nothing at all

crow
always getting
the last word

unchecked injustice
an overpriced
light beer

chasing a mosquito
dust flies
from the plastic flowers

chasing a mosquito
dust escapes
the plastic flowers

broken clouds
my mother
watches me read

batting practice
swatting flies
in the right field bleachers

deep winter
an empty bird cage

writer’s block
a cork stuck
in a wine bottle

in a dream
a dead branch carried away
by butterflies

preparing for departure
a line of wheelchairs
at the gate

still wandering
the empty corridor
cheap perfume

airplane mode
my words
breathless

achoo!
my mother hands me
a vitamin c

air turbulence
an overfriendly passenger
playing solitaire

final approach
i forget my carefully rehearsed
pick-up line

topless beach
a sand castle
with two towers

the castle of my dreams
built from sand

equinox
splitting
the last of the wine

half full
half empty
equinox

equinox
an 18-wheeler crossing
the double yellow line

taking down the cross
the old church
converted to condos

green light
a broken umbrella
crosses the street

equinox
the last
of the pain meds

tempest in a teapot
my mother
serves me decaf

cherry blossoms
the letter
i never sent

blind date
she thinks i can’t
see her texting

her long dark hair
the lingering fragrance
of exotic spices

with a wink
she tells me the name
of the missing spice

the morning after
a spent shotgun shell

white horse tavern
i order a cure
for writer’s block

march wind
ripples
in the snowmelt

my father points
to where ebbett’s field
used to be

i won’t tell her
it’s not
a shooting start

i won’t tell her
it’s not
a shooting star

spring in the air
the grave-digger’s
rich baritone

secrets so dark
i keep them
from myself

buried beneath
a pile of cliché
the missing puzzle piece

still pond
koi swim
through the sky

stock options
the dog farts
in his sleep

does the rose know
its thorns are so sharp?

an epiphany
i don’t know
when easter is

so in love
with that song
i can almost sing

unspoken words
the paper lanterns
of my dreams

ignoring the symbolism
i touch her hand
beneath the willow

broken carousel
ghost lovers
whispering

march wind
reminding myself
to breathe

late winter chill
my wife cuddles
with the dog

so tranquil
in the open sea
man o’ war

crescent moon
the fullness
of her hips

my letter to the editor
returned for postage

a spy in our midst
the racoon’s
beady eyes

killing frost
her lipstick
drop-dead red

staring at the horizon
i empty my glass
before the sun can set

lost in a daydream
the season’s
first firefly

chasing away
my nightmare
birdsong

lost for words
i rearrange
the poetry magnets

broken clouds
the weekend exchange
of the children

small town election
recycled
campaign promises

pay day
sopping up
the last of the soup

for sale
the necklace
you once wore

love
is walking the dog
in the rain

a cobblestone grounder
on the stickball field
of my dreams

play ball!
the dog twitching
in his sleep

mixed precipitation
i guess we’re all
april fools

fresh snow
the rhododendrons
take a bow

opening day
was that
a wink?

it happens
a late-inning rally
falls short

april fool
putting away
the ice scraper

lost
all the stars
in the sky

an old punk sighs
johnny rotten’s
new teeth

new moon
remembering
what we lost
in the fire

the new granddaughter
i smile
like an april fool

twilight
she tells me she has
a spare toothbrush

a long day
draining
another pint glass

marginal street
a hasty application
of perfume

long meeting
i don’t know why
the caged bird sings

synchronicity
we finish our beers
at the same time

april baseball
i remember
how to swear

rolling the dice
the bartender buys
the next round

awakening to
the mythical creatures
in my dreams

feeling lucky
the first photos
of my seventh grandchild

asked his favorite color
grandpa replies
strawberry blonde

asked his favorite flavor
grandpa replies
strawberry blonde

restless night
chasing the train
of my dreams

finally spring
explaining to the dog
that he can’t fly

april dawn
a broken branch
twisting in the wind

downtown crossing
a man in a kilt
eating pizza

flat beer
a ninth-inning
meltdown

crescent moon
my newest granddaughter
sleeps

extra innings
she’s not tired
after all

a young mother scolds
the little girl
with angel wings

ambivalence
do i have writer’s block
or not?

stack overflow
my day
gets longer

new photos
of my granddaughter
crocuses in bloom

swept at home
the cobwebs
i knew by name

twilight
the dog
leaves my side

writer’s block
an empty
salt shaker

unseasonably mild
a hallway discussion
about trust issues

pebble in my shoe
wall street limps
to another loss

baby’s breath
the dog curled up
in a fetal position

the old oak tree
where we first kissed
marked with an x

clearing skies
wondering where
the hawk is headed

bitter wine
time for that conversation
about mom

tonight’s weather
a continuum
of sighs

dusk
a bridge
i’ve yet to cross

scalding hot coffee
i board the wrong train
right on time

early spring
the dog
rediscovers moths

in the news
a boy who once trick-or-treated
with my kids

between powerpoint slides
the crashing waves
far, far away

late meeting
the beautiful day
outside

crocuses
remembering the song
of the tree frog

ninth inning
i invent a new word
for umpire

trying not to laugh
his dogged determination
to keep my slipper

dreamless sleep
all the trains
i’ve missed

april dusk
an unopened
christmas gift

the rivalry continues
puppies at play

april sky
debating
if it’s going to rain

spring rain
a child’s toy
in the debris

palm sunday
crows on a
bare tree branch

beautiful day
wondering how it is
somewhere else

twilight
my white hair
whiter

above our heads
a woodpecker
dishonors the sabbath

trickle-down economics
i get a paper cut
from my tax refund

morning mist
the fragrance
of strong coffee

bridge of sighs
she doesn’t see me
wave goodbye

waiting for me
a door
in the desert

first date
something
i said

lunar eclipse
she doesn’t
recognize me

ripe plums
the taste
of her lipstick

blustery night
the politician’s
trembling fist

blood moon
my son’s
new facebook profile

tax day
not even lint
in my pockets

sudden downpour
our dinner plans
down the drain

holy week
headless mannequins
in pastel dresses

tax day
tonight we drink
the cheap wine

a faint smudge
where the mosquito
once was

news of his death
it’s winter
all over again

alone in a field
an old goat
staring at me

a sudden headache
daffodils
in the snow

false spring
a blown call
at second base

on the other side
of these thin walls
a familiar spirit

dusk
more photo ops
at the finish line

goose egg moon
the homeless man’s
blank stare

goose egg moon
a mixed day
on wall street

dusk
the haiku
that got away

holy week
three bare trees
against a gray sky

guarded
by dust bunnies
my baseball glove

good friday
my son holds his daughter
for the first time

cold coffee
an adrenaline rush
i didn’t want

eyelids at half-mast
i salute
my last beer

suburban lullaby
a duet
of leaf blowers

green light
my favorite song
drives away

moonlight
her beckoning
silhouette

reaching the bottom
an empty shot glass

dusk
that song
still makes me cry

dancing in the street
a discarded cigarette

patriot’s day
a homeless veteran’s
weathered sign

high noon
seeking shade
from a satellite dish

moments before dawn
the rusty railroad tracks
of my dreams

dandelions
the old caboose

marathon monday
the slow drive home

a sudden chill
my credit card
declined

darkening sky
a stack
of unpaid bills

open window
the mockingbird
is an early riser

open window
a new dog
in the neighborhood

open window
welcome back,
tree frogs

spring rain
the long
journey home

opening the wine
the storm
moves offshore

after the storm
a baseball helmet
full of rain

yankees in town
hot dog wrappers
cross the field

midnight
kissing
her wine-stained lips

last of the mezcal
the lingering smoke

wind advisory
the politician’s speech

explaining to my mother
what afternoon delight means

the old wooden church
for sale or lease

rough winds
a distant relative whispers
alzheimer’s

all that matters
is the next
tummy rub

sunset
the stray dog’s
sad eyes

breakfast of champions
to heat or not to heat
the leftover pizza

under construction
an origami crane

the silence
when too much coffee
isn’t enough

restless night
a mouse
in the attic

baja sunrise
the lingering mist

spring mist
my granddaughter cries
in my arms

sitting at my desk
exotic daydreams

my daughter’s birthday
a child’s balloon
above the clouds

fumes of buses
the dying’s
just begun

under attic dust
another unopened envelope

driftwood
you ask me
where i’ve been

a blank page
all that matters
is the next breath

dirty water
the kind
no one loves

today’s headline
a splash
in the pond

tornado watch
now available
in hd

rain in the forecast
the dog
steals my blanket

the shame
of drinking
the shame away

midnight
the tattoo artist’s
empty refrigerator

cleaning out the attic
a month
of throwback thursdays

clouds without rain
the dog barks
at nothing

clouds without rain
a deal i didn’t make
with the devil

on a cold night
the hollow echo
of your voice

only tuesday
the howling wind

cactus flower
she doesn’t think
her dress is too short

morning showers
a kiss
from the dog

may day
her long hair
undone

may day
the top two buttons of her blouse
undone

before sunrise
i dread
the early bird

naked mango
a bead of sweat
on my cocktail glass

morning yoga
i left my legs
at home

last day of april
the slightest nod
to the bartender

sign
on the church door reads
do not enter

the cashier’s distrust
when i help her make change

may day
her dragon tattoo
glares at me

crescent moon
did she just
wink at me?

st. patrick’s day
the cat’s
emerald eyes

open mic
the taste
of bad poetry

weekend cocktail
the dog sighs

heat advisory
the taste
of her sweat

new moon
the season’s
first mosquito

hope springs eternal
the home team
takes the field

unamused
when grandpa calls her
a sturdy woman

spring cleaning
the sales receipt
for my first wedding band

face twitching
the bumble bee chaser
sleeps

birds!
explaining to the dog
that he can’t fly

i don’t want
to hear them hum
high-voltage wires

high-voltage wire
i don’t want
to hear it hum

wind advisory
speaker of the house
on meet the press

wind advisory
political pundits
on meet the press

wondering if my children
sense me dreaming about them

equal time
the dog
licks my face too

dusk
a child’s balloon
letting go

cinco de mayo
the cactus
unmoved

no longer friends
a dead tree limb
trembling in the wind

the elephant in the room
she’s using
her maiden name

between breaths
face-to-face
with a humming bird

the cruel flirt!
azaleas in bloom

written
in the sunset
her name

lost and found
the umbrella
we once shared

now a grandfather
they tell me i have
my grandfather’s eyes

tough day
i go heavy
on the hot sauce

man’s best friend
sitting patiently
at the grill

game on
she says
i shut
the game off

idle time
broke down engine blues

my autobiography
an open parenthesis

these words
lost
in the mist

slippery elm
grandpa offers me
some chewing tobacco

waxing moon
she stares
straight through me

intermittent drizzle
i argue
with an umbrella

almond eyes
i forget
the question

a poet’s dilemma
to burn or recycle
her old letters

texas rain
the hometown boy
who’s not coming home

broken clouds
the junkyard dog’s
wagging tail

clipped from a photograph
the one
who never apologized

approaching rain
the dog sighs

mother’s day
azalea petals
in the wind

that dress
so tight
i could burst

sunburst finish
the standing ovation
in my head

dead dog beach
a pair of eyes
that never blink

dead dog beach
two eyes
that never blink

under construction
the carpenter’s house

the early bird keeps me
from falling back to sleep

much too happy
about winning
at solitaire

old photograph
my vegetarian daughter
dressed like a lamb

with a warm smile
a little girl tells me
i’m going to hell

audible sigh
a roll
of undeveloped film

awaiting takeoff
my mind wanders into
the mile-high club

persistent drizzle
grandpa flirts
with schoolgirls

clinging
to her neck
spring rain

flower moon
my granddaughter
makes a peace sign

speeding past
my exit
a shooting star

dead end
the street dog’s
wary eyes

starless night
i point to where
my high school used to be

game seven
even the dog
can’t bear to watch

what is she wearing?
and yes
there is a full moon

closing time
the saxophone
echoes

closing time
the saxophone echoes
in my head

flower moon
the sundress slips
from her shoulder

the elegant simplicity
when the dog
lifts its leg

no sunrise
she didn’t make it
through the night

missing the point
i aim
more carefully

spring rain
washing
the week away

light rain
the slugger’s
towering pop fly

loud conversation
i envy
the ostrich

columbus circle
i discover
i’m lost

alley cat
unimpressed
with my sandwich

closing time
the jukebox plays
fade into you

blues on the green
the dog chases
a honey bee

fever dream
leadbelly’s
crooked bow tie

one beer too many
the punk girlfriend
i never had

over bad coffee
a co-worker
mispronounces my name

end of the weekend
a shopping cart
with a broken wheel

between the legs
of the seasoned veteran
october dreams

broke
the gps tells me
i have arrived

unplanned work
a sticky note
falls to the floor

scattered showers
junk mail
for the dog

late-night drive
destination
anywhere

migraine
a cloud
shaped like a fist

as if it knows
where it’s going
red balloon

sales flyers
i nearly forget
memorial day

five o’clock shadow
wall street
gets a shave

her irish eyes
yes i said yes
i will yes

cloudless sky
an eagle perched
on a satellite dish

gibbous moon
the bloom
off the rose

morning birdsong
trying to remember
my dream

between dreams
the dog
licks my face

full of promise
the starless sky

rose blossoms
the neighborhood tomboy’s
cleavage

silent wind
striking out
with the bases loaded

field of dreams
the prospect’s
early exit

rose blossoms
the sway
of her hips

class photo
the faces
i don’t remember

her evening attire
summer moonlight

broken flowers
mother’s day wishes
on a deceased friend’s facebook wall

between showers
a dog barks
at the wind

long weekend
my foot swollen
from kicking the lawn mower

the spoiled child
unhappy
with his happy meal

long weekend
the crickets
settle in

friday night
lowriders
getting high

memorial day
forgetting
who won the war

memorial day
freshly fallen rain

slowly trickling
between her breasts
glistening pearls

trendy nightclub
an epic clash
of colognes

hipster pub
an epic battle
of beards

writer’s block
beneath
the robin’s nest

my home town
the dead tree
no one wants
to cut down

extra innings
my second wind
grows still

extra innings
the beer buzz
wears off

slowly
between her breasts
glistening pearls

sleepy-eyed
i still call it
her toy

outside the emergency room
an empty whiskey bottle

memorial day
my daily reunion
with the dog

memorial day rain
umbrellas
in formation

pouring out a beer
for the one
who didn’t come back

lone buck
watching me
watching him

inchworm
i measure
my words

out of wine
the sky darkens

concealed weapon
the first line
of a senryu

distant thunder
the receptionist’s
icy stare

pay day
a mouse
empties the trap

new moon
letting the phone call
go to voicemail

admiring
the industrious ant
under foot

four-way intersection
the sleeping dog’s paws

new moon
i know it’s out there
somewhere

epiphany
i forget
what day it is

startled from sleep
a runaway kite

startled from sleep
the last ferry home

just in time
for the weekend
rain

peaks island ferry
making friends
with the dog

crowded ferry
the dog everyone
wants to pet

long meeting
the back door reads
no exit

beach rose
glistening
in the sun

beach rose
preparing
to blossom

cloudless sky
a restless dog
sniffing the breeze

sunday hangover
the church bells
in my head

freshwater bog
the stories
i never told you

donuts, guns
day school

ferry landing
at the corner
of hello and goodbye

sign
on the broke fence
go away

talking politics
a hole
in the fence

heavy sigh
the first firefly

pale sky
i apologize
for everything

wondering
if a fox
can foxtrot

night terror
a crack
in the mirror

night terror
a crack
in the sky

reminding grandpa
we don’t call them foxes
anymore

full of tequila
i tell her
i am the moon

wild lilacs
i know why
she’s blushing

happy hour
not quite enough
for a bus ticket

happy hour
not quite enough
for a ticket home

outside the square
a pile
of abandoned bicycles

outside the square
a bicycle
chained to a fence

how voluptuous her lips
when she says
voluptuous

cloudless sky
convincing her
that grandpa speaks finch

clumsy drunk
i drop
your name

startled from sleep
angels welcome me
to hell

for sale
the vacant church

rip tide
i forget
everything

afterglow
the flood waters
recede

opening a beer
the flood waters
recede

pressure drop
embraced
by my cocktail

throwback thursday
the one
i should have thrown back

fever dream
a homeless man
repeats my thoughts

old photo
in which
i look young

her lips
so voluptuous
when she says
voluptuous

free wifi
in my neighbor’s driveway

play ball!
the prospect’s
clean jersey

d-day
unpaid bills
on the horizon

d-day
the wine-stained carpet

hidden in the attic
a box
of broken soldiers

the fragrance
of your letters
in the fire

remembering
father’s day
a tree branch falls

summer fog
what never
could have been

puppy’s new friend
the firefly

there must be days
with neither beer nor haiku
but not today

almost done with my beer
the crickets
just getting started

one bottle later
a budding romance
under the bridge

fork in the road
i wonder
what’s for lunch

sipping absinthe
i plot
the next revolution

crowded playground
nobody asks me
what’s in the brown bag

suburban haze
countdown
to the first beer

in the waiting room
his argument
with a cell phone

summer breeze
a shower
of tree pollen

shadows lengthen
into haiku cliché

dead dog beach
an inconvenient
birthday present

holding the door
for the invisible man

mercury retrograde
a text message
not intended for me

returning my stare
a faceless mannequin

haunting my dreams
the face
in the knotty pine

gibbous moon
i never noticed
her hips

home late from work
i step over
her nightgown

scattered showers
i forget
why i’m here

summer rain
wall street
closes flat

wondering
where all the lone
gunmen go

still alive
the lone gunman’s
facebook page

last of the wine
a pop-up
into the lights

last of the wine
the vanishing horizon

racing past
the empty bench
my wordless thoughts

i’ve named
this undrinkable cocktail
after you

folding my pizza
to strange looks
in a strange town

poetry slam
all the hipsters
and me

ruining my life
by dying
too soon

racing past
the empty bench
words

approaching storm
an empty coffee cup
crosses wall street

rain delay
showing the dog
a knuckleball grip

between construction cranes
a shooting star

lost in fog
my skyscraper
romance

pitchers’ duel
the dog sighs
in his sleep

lovers’ lane
closed
for construction

lovers’ lane
under construction

that moment
before
the moment

full of wine
i dance
with the stars

summer rain
the river rising
in an old blues song

lost in fog
the illusion
of control

wondering
if my third eye
is bloodshot too

love at first sight
the puppy
tilts his head

black flag
my eardrums
red, white and blue

flag day
a parade
of fortunate sons

small town parade
a turtle
crosses the road

father’s day
no i haven’t
heard this one before

still too big for me
my father’s shoes

falling from grace
her whiskey flask

strawberry moon
red highlights
in her hair

earth day
paw prints
on my pillow

writer’s block
a dead skunk
in the storm drain

wide-eyed hipsters
in search of
the drugstore cowboy

eyes clenched shut
yes i said yes i will yes

clouds without rain
i like
her status update

at the flea market
an engagement ring
looks strangely familiar

summer haze
the veteran
clears out his locker

hazy night
the dog panting
in his sleep

the cool of night
crickets
sigh

dreams of pescadero
the lingering smoke
in the mezcal

waking from a nightmare
summer fog

ghost town
shadows fade
into themselves

fading from the radio
fade into you

gibbous moon
a frightened dog
just out of reach

street dog
afraid to take shelter
from the rain

balmy night
an idling truck

cat’s eyes
following
the dog

sudden gust
his comb-over
over

high tide
my sand castle dreams

summer solstice
the dog’s breath

solstice
my valleys
peak

tree frog
a song
i’ve always known

the rhythm
of my rhymelessness

at the end of the bar
a regular’s
unblinking glare

last call
she tells me the devil
wrote her a song

solstice
my asymmetric face

solstice
grandpa’s face
after the stroke

first day of summer
withering dandelions

first day of summer
a catalpa flower
in her hair

longest day
silence
over cocktails

after a morning run
her first cigarette

in and out of focus
a child’s balloon
ascending

clouds
an expired
sale coupon

over milk and cookies
grandpa,
what’s a sex pistol?

knowing
she meant nothing
by that wink
that meant everything

knowing
she meant nothing
by that wink

school’s out
an extra spring
in the wino’s step

ferry landing
an empty cup
floats away

swishing through
the basketball net
a butterfly

goal!
the shopping cart
hits a car

summer dusk
an empty birdhouse

harvest moon
the fullness
of her hips

restless night
something
sniffing the bait

long meeting
i hear only
the clock

salvation
in a white lexus
idling

a haiku moment
the puppy
discovers fireflies

waning moon
i lose
my train of thought

caught in the act
of staring at
her fishnet stockings

caught
staring at
her fishnet stockings

turbulence
another bumpy ride
on wall street

writer’s block
the moon
reduced to a sliver

young love
a sleeping puppy

summer wind
the ebbets field
of my dreams

peanut shells
one out shy
of a perfect game

clouds
his shelter
from the rain

wondering when
to start waiting
’til next year

far from the mosh pit
i recognize the parents
of the band

new moon
crossing the border
undetected

road trip
no one cares
where i’m going

sigh
motionless
windmills

writer’s block
motionless windmills

in the hotel parking lot
truckers
compare tattoos

over powdered eggs
a wide-screen tv
without sound

at the junction
of desolation and nowhere
seagulls

camper’s cologne
a generous layer
of bug spray

new moon
a friend
unfriends me

bright sunshine
a cloud
of mosquitoes

someone else
camping
at my old deer blind

over strong drink
the storms
in the captain’s eyes

a dog’s journey
from favorite chair
to favorite couch

morning sunshine
even the butterfly hunter
has to rest

after three cups of coffee
i swat mosquitoes
that aren’t there

swatting at mosquitoes
that aren’t there

last day of june
the puppy
discovers frogs

pay day
who will i be able
to pay today?

over pasties
comparing
insect repellents

sleeping in
a less-than-gentle nudge
from the dog

today’s entertainment
the puppy
chasing dragonfiles

my favorite song
sea breeze
rustling the palms

the dog and i
awaiting
the first firefly

beaten unconscious
in a dream
my throbbing hangover

over dirty dishes
fresh gossip

school’s out
a rabbit
in the garden

morning chill
a familiar name
in the obituary

ripples
on the lake
a heavy sigh

around the fire pit
the ones who never left

the search for new galaxies
at the bottom of my pint glass

removing my shoes
the gleam
in the dog’s eye

the crumbling church
wild dogs
at play

wild lilies
remembering
why we’re here

hungry and rested
the evening’s mosquitoes

high school reunion
everyone wondering
whose husband i am

splayed across
the grand piano
a grumpy old cat

fourth of july fireworks
one dog too many
in the pet parade

still winning every coin toss
grandpa’s two-headed nickel

lost lake
no one’s quite sure
where it is

crossing the border
without passports
a flock of geese

just happy to be here
road kill
in the sun

always contrary
my garden
doesn’t grow

lost on a country road
the deepening silence

outside the hotel lobby
prostitutes soliciting
my dog

writer’s block
the miles
between rest stops

writer’s block
another 18-wheeler
rushes by

summer haze
returning the gift
i forgot to give you

approaching thunder
two bored dogs
in the living room

summer haze
back-to-back meetings
in a crowded conference room

just enough moonshine
to wash away
everything

not nearly enough rain
to wash away
a single indiscretion

summer swoon
the home team
prays for rain

praying for rain
the mantis

thunder
the desert
explodes

high tide
a surf board
washes ashore

between nightmares
a pre-dawn
cat fight

rain delay
she reaches
for a book

a toast
to mistakes
i’ve yet to make

in the ruins
of an old church
ghosts bow in prayer

ghost peppers
my life flashes
before my eyes

gibbous moon
finally
a smile

smoke screen
i promise to quit
if you promise to stay

losing streak
the lingering haze

i envy the grass
that stained
her new white blouse

insurmountable
the green monster
of my dreams

summer haze
she asks me why
the dog is smiling

averting my eyes
from the whitewashed walls
of the abandoned church

slow steady rain
the fishermen
mend their nets

how i long to fly
too close to the sun

out of wine
rain trickles into
the arroyo

serving me a cocktail
she whistles
love potion #9

redemption
the preacher’s daughter
in a miracle bra

the elegant dance
of an egret
perfectly still

the perfect beach
closed
due to unexploded ordinance

thunder moon
the dog’s
unblinking eye

a diamond in the rough
her pre-engagement ring

she tells me
there’s one more diamond
i’ve yet to see

rainy season
she promised me
clouds

beachside bar
the perfect wave
in her hair

what wisdom lies
in this conference
of crows?

what wisdom
in this conference
of crows?

super moon
i had forgotten
how pretty she was

no breeze
the rookie
takes strike three

thunder moon
all eyes
on her hips

thunder moon
a game-ending
double play

goal!
soldiers lay down their weapons
for ninety minutes

full moon
the lines on my face
lengthen

crosstown traffic
tire tracks
across my back

crosstown traffic
leading nowhere

crosstown traffic
hendrix solos
to a hip-hop beat

a rudderless boat
i remember you

yard sale
saying goodbye
to my old guitar

summer rain
an arpeggiated chord

after the rain
a puddle
filled with clouds

rain
we agree
to disagree

sick day
a housefly trapped
between window panes

pay day
settling a debt
i never owed

unsettled air
a robin chases sparrows
from a mud puddle

whose bonemud lies
beneath the surface
of the arroyo?

pancakes anyone?
wall street
closes flat

old faithful
the alarm clock

the loss of clarity
after waking
from a dream

a sudden gust
yesterday’s headline
crosses the street

also in need of tlc
no one calls me
a classic

after the storm
sparrows return to their
regularly scheduled program

cease fire
the dog drops his bone
and bares his teeth

writer’s block
the restless rattle
of a ceiling fan

rush hour
looking for the mute button
on a fellow commuter

looking for
the mute button
on a fellow commuter

hotel lobby
the cute receptionist asks
if i’m checking out

waiting room
another word
for thesaurus

a grain of sand
between my toes
i hear the ocean

hotel lobby
checking out
the cute receptionist

casualties of war
a dog abandoned
at the beach

closing time
someone calls me
a barfly

that summer moment
when the puppy
discovers grasshoppers

the rockets’ red glare
illuminates
nothing

sound check
the roadie
takes a bow

retirement daydreams
crows
in a dead tree

retirement dreams
a shooting star

full of beer
all the empty chairs

undisturbed
footprints
on the moon

under construction
mourning the loss
of my favorite graffiti

between the lines
of the history book
how the west was lost

double espresso
the silence
ringing in my ears

lusting for war
a chattering squirrel

income inequality
a fat squirrel
at the bird feeder

and still it glides
a red-tailed hawk feather

dead end
mourning
what might have been

low tide
searching for meaning
in the broken shells

low tide
all the broken shells

barely holding together
a rusty bridge

morning fog
the glow
of an oncoming train

summer haze
wondering where
the songbird went

gone much too soon
my margarita

24 hour news
a crime drama
between talking heads

well-constructed
her under construction t-shirt

while the cop sleeps
an uncontested
stolen base

summer haze
still listening
for the songbird

her retirement party
a glorious sunset

after siesta
a shopkeeper sweeps
the cracked sidewalk

interrupting
our stickball game
an open fire hydrant

chasing flies
the slugger’s
twin girls

deepening dawn
my hair
one shade of gray

one-hit shutout
the long silent
bus ride home

hostilities cease
the mail man
holds up a milk bone

umbrella
blocking
the meteor shower

tough night
i order the tequila
in the skull-shaped bottle

glancing at
my retirement portfolio
a mousetrap snaps

the best haiku
is always the one
i’ve yet to write

bass solo
this beer line
is too long

tail wagging
for no reason
the one-eyed dog

a photo of me
from my awkward phase
yesterday

company picnic
reveling in the people
who don’t know me

snapdragons
the shuttle bus
to summer camp

waning moon
an ambulance leaves the nursing home
with its lights off

my glass half empty
the bartender fills
her tank top

caught in the act
morning glories

wall street falters
i pour
a golden ale

late-inning meltdown
a fallen
ice cream cone

the extra spring in her step
when she jogs
without a bra

waking from a dream
i didn’t give up coffee
after all

minutes into our date
she asks
if i’m always like this

rainy day
an extra helping
of hot sauce

storm warning
the slugger’s
bat flip

moonless night
a dead dog
on the side of the road

overcast
wondering where
the weekend went

desolation ridge
how peaceful
the rocks below

the road not taken
and the promise
to remain friends

summer drought
a called
strike three

lightning
the dog’s eyes
widen

summer breeze
the schoolgirls giggle
as i walk by

never guessing
that the town drunk
would be me

an impressive collection
all the books
i’ve never read

sick day
the dumpster door
crashes shut

trade deadline
the dog gives up my shoe
for a treat

family picnic
looking for a place
to play solitaire

playing solitaire
at a family picnic

bases empty
a seagull soaring over
the green monster

just in time
for an afternoon meeting
a two pint buzz

rush hour traffic
geese honking
overhead

shafts of sunlight
between skyscrapers

with a wink he says
may all your wishes come true

scattered clouds
a wall street
sell-off

summer weekend
a hurried goodbye

summer clearance
on yawkey way

summer swoon
a fire sale
on yawkey way

cease-fire
the dogs pause
for treats

regrets
a child’s balloon
overhead

lost in
the vaguely familiar city
of my dreams

heat wave
the stock market
wilts

heat wave
a bead of sweat
on the nape of her neck

broken clouds
the mud
left behind

snow shoveling done
the teenager emerges
from hibernation

navigating
the swamp
in my basement

in the rubble
of their former home
children play with guns

storm clouds
tonight
i drink alone

summer twilight
our shadows
hold hands

lazy sunday morning
the puppy hiccups

lazy sunday
another phone call
gone to voicemail

meteor shower
hoping
she’ll spend the night

summer twilight
putting down the book
i haven’t started reading

staff meeting
watching the pot
boil

between meetings
the watched pot
boils

cold snap
smokers
huddle closer

caught
in its own web
the dead spider

in the summer mist
fireflies

summer dusk
seagulls gather
at the compost heap

off-night
the bartender whistles
a gospel tune

mosquito pier
a starfish
on a moonless night

between dreams
every sound
is a crashing wave

beyond
my final beer
the blurred clarity

ferry landing
every
broken promise

scattered clouds
even half my age
isn’t so young

i hope she’s not texting
about the red light
she’s about to run

reaching for my keys
i lock the door
behind me

age spots
a deal i didn’t make
with the devil

storm warning
a friend’s
cancer returns

huddled
on the double yellow line
a trio of wild turkeys

coquí
have you followed me
all the way to boston?

overnight shift
the highlighted passages
in the night watchman’s bible

my third cup of coffee
one more river
to cross

gibbous moon
she calls
my bluff

gibbous moon
who’s bluffing?

my hometown library
now a flea market

low tide
a diamond ring
beneath the pier

down port
the lines
on the fisherman’s face

the last ferry
a ride
on grandpa’s shoulders

shifting winds
the bartender puts away
the good stuff

blocking my view
of the polluted lake
my exwife

missing the ferry
a man swears
at the keno machine

spoiled child
the ferry
leaves the dock

reviewing my resume
would i hire myself?

summer jog
i can watch it
all day

over morning cocktails
a yoga class
on the beach

end of the weekend
the fireflies
grow dim

hot sun
the struggling rookie’s
stubble

red moon
lights out
without a sound

mountain hike
we can never outrun
the mosquitoes

the birds
watching me
birdwatching

deep summer
moss on the belly
of buddha

my old neighborhood
the burned out bodega
of my dreams

news of his death
if alladin could grant
just one more wish

shark week
i remember
to floss

waning moon
a stranger
unfriends me

paradigm shift
a truck backfires

an elbow to the ribs
while mouthing
grandpa’s punchlines

first to the food bowl
a three-legged dog

moonless night
an old dog
dreams

windless night
a hanging curveball

snake in tall grass
a split-fingered fastball

grand canyon
shouting
at my echo

like the rain
the meteor shower
just misses us

shark week
the dog’s ear
twitches

in the o
of the hotel sign
sparrows build a nest

perfect day
i win a second
game of solitaire

writer’s block
the starless sky

unspoken words
an acorn falls

called strike three
the arc
of a thrown bat

silencing
the tree frogs
screech owl

55 years later
the acorns
still fall

summer dusk
closer to the tomb
than the womb

big inning
the dog
still wants to play

camera crews gone
shadows cross
the picket line

over burned toast
explaining to my mother
what trip-hop is

summer dusk
searching for meaning
in the hawk’s cry

lights out
a bullfrog
serenade

lord hobo
the trustafarian’s
dirty blond dreads

tax-free weekend
the captive crowds

treefrogs
a capella

over my head
an easy pop fly

one hour on hold
they must be hoping
i die soon

last call
the wail
of a blues harp

in my dream
none of this
was a dream

interrupting deep sleep
a robot voice tells me
i may have already won

sunset
sweeping
the cracked sidewalk

idling loudly
the next-door neighbor’s
mid-life crisis

the morning after
children play
with unused flares

late for the ferry
seagulls squabble
over trash

my summer muse
mixing cocktails
with a plastic-tipped cigar

and in another dream
a burro’s tail
chasing flies

soaking in
the cloudless sunshine
a dead squirrel

rough day
the hiss
of a braking train

crack pipe
counting
the denials

campus visit
ducklings
in single file

televised
how far
we have to go

not taking a hint
the dog’s tail
too close to the fire

writer’s block
an empty roll
of toilet paper

baja sunset
a street dog
sniffs the air

fearing
welcoming
el chubasco

bases loaded
i switch
to the cheap wine

well-tanned
the pool shark

sabre dance
boldly threatening
faceless strangers

ice bucket challenge
a donation
for drought relief

hostage crisis
the dog
and my shoes

not yet autumn
the changing colors
of clothes shopping

unable to look away
the gentle eyes
of a dead deer

a proud day
my grandson needs two hands
to show me his age

play time is over
grandpa picks up
the super soaker

late-summer chill
a fastball whistling past
the rookie’s chin

reflected
in honest twilight
my white hair

hungover
i sharpen
my axe

hungover
i chop wood
with a dull axe

hurricane warning
the wrong side
of a big inning

hurricane party
the dog
hunkers down

striking out with bases loaded
if only it were a metaphor

in the santa fe of my dreams
chiles roasting in the plaza

cactus flower
the last time
i fell in love

twilight
wanting to be
my dog

unblinking
he won’t explain
his teardrop tattoo

spring cleaning
from one drawer
to another

the sign of the horns
must mean something very different
down here

do the cockroaches know
this is a 5-star hotel?

late summer
hornets
undeterred

she returned from college
with a hyphen
in her last name

fall color
a freshly-washed
school bus

mid-day sun
an iguana
cocks its head

winning at solitaire
i was never too good
at being alone

shameless flirt
calling my hair
prematurely gray

summer haze
the slugger’s
batting slump

morning gridlock
unable to
find the words

summer haze
the dog’s breath

dining al fresco
a family of sparrows
joins us

moon gazing
a tape measure
home run

ferry landing
hoisting my granddaughter
onto my shoulders

lightning
she offers to be
my muse

thunderclouds
the size
of my headache

new moon
the same old me

red sky
realizing i don’t know
what it means

a streetcar
with no name
his dilated pupils

unhooking her bra
the constellations
in the sky

back to school
the nanny’s boyfriend
right on time

labor day approaching
the squirrels
gather acorns

downtown crossing
do the drunks think
i’m one of them?

forever dusk
a distant train

unwilling to commit
to my friendly neighbor’s
hedge fund

gloucester pub
the bartender
calls me captain

in the bag
six empty cans
and me

dead dog beach
a tourist’s photo op

counting the cans
i stack up every night
to forget you

moonless night
the dog’s
dirty paws

deep winter
the radiator
hums

the rookie
still perfecting
his home run trot

in tune
with itself
a 1-string guitar

losing time
a broken
hourglass

last call
a regular
hugs the bar

summer breeze
the dog’s
flaring nostrils

thunder clouds
my eyes remove
her sun dress

labor day
i take a peek
at my retirement fund

crescent moon
i pretend not to see
her wink

hot jazz
the beer bottle
sweats

under the bridge
what is and isn’t
driftwood

labor day
the dog digs up a bone
in the garden

an early harvest
pumpkin ale
in the beer aisle

removing her bra
buoys bobbing
in the surf

braless
the secret
to her smile

guarding the weeds
in grandma’s garden
a shrine to mary

igniting the whitecaps
september sunset

election season rhetoric
a passing thunderstorm

september call-ups
the veteran spits out
sunflower shells

thunder clap
the battery argues
balls and strikes

summer picnic
my granddaughter
wants her nose back

still summer
she tells me her eyes
are up here

dreaming i kissed her
the girl who won’t give me
the time of day

red-tailed hawk
does his business card say
majestic?

new moon
my haiku submission
rejected via email

foul ball
two hands
on my beer

reading the writing
on the conference room wall

summer heat
ice cubes
in my wine glass

dusk
a photo of me
with dark hair

sunset
washing down my meds
with whiskey on the rocks

traveling incognito
my shadow
in the shade

last days of summer
a little boy
chasing a kite

sweet sixteen
the diamond
still glistens

sleeping through
my morning meditation

hugging a curve
i feel you
inching closer

baja sunset
now i know
what indigo looks like

windless summer night
our commingled sweat

stillness
the koi pond
of my dreams

cold front
she crosses
to the other side
of the street

heat lightning
something about
that name

at the end
of the nature trail
an idling truck

empty t station
a saxophone plays
love potion #9

guitar solo
she tells me she wants
every inch of my love

vanishing point
where she
used to live

cold front
she crosses
the street

always waiting
for the train
wild irises

feeling like cheese
when she tells me
i age well

harvest moon
a new short haircut

wine moon
savoring
the moment

ripening
above the clouds
harvest moon

out of coffee
the fluorescent lights
stop flickering

harvest moon
an old dog toy

harvest moon
unhooking
her bra

harvest moon
one less item
for the yard sale

end of summer
all her tattoos
covered

primary day
of secondary importance

asking the twins
to introduce themselves
again

pulchritude
such an ugly
word

lightning
illuminating
my empty bed

end of summer
she tells me she once
had a crush on me

storm watch
the dog
and his favorite toy

september chill
the veteran tapes up
his ankle

winning at solitaire
and nobody
cares

glaring at me
a woman’s
dragon tattoo

still taking my breath away
the plumes of black smoke

another dimly lit corner
where we never kissed

crosstown local
the hipster and i
have the same glasses

painting the sky
a gull’s shadow

writer’s block
not a cloud
in the sky

the moment i knew
she wasn’t the one

a pretty girl
i forget
to breathe

tennis date
he compliments her
on a nice set

not sure how he feels
about her fascination
with cigars

caressing the canvas
of her next tattoo

impromptu meeting
the old dog play bows
to the puppy

yard sale
nobody wants
my old guitar

halloween night
patiently waiting
for ghosts

chilly night
street food
for ghosts

writer’s block
brake lights
in the fast lane

on the boardwalk
an old man carefully avoids
stepping on shadows

breaking news
of an election
over 2 years away

a billboard asks
if i’ve considered christ

gray sky
a police helicopter
circles the projects

lost
in central park
a child’s balloon

morning tutorial
a birthmark
in the front row

herald of free enterprise
a sinking feeling

louder than
my unspoken thoughts
the mouth-breather

realizing
i’m not in
the target demographic

between 1st and 3rd avenues
a frenzied sax solo

7th avenue express
the homeless man’s shoes
are nicer than mine

keeping time
with the l train
the blind man’s cane

independence day
an untethered
fishing boat

her response
to an email
i never sent

harvard divinity school
ivy embraces
the fire escape

dancing
in the empty ballroom
the mirrored ball’s reflection

rushing to my next appointment
i climb
the down escalator

flipping off the cab driver
the bike courier
runs a red light

53rd and 6th
the chop and sizzle
of a food truck

waiting for the bus
a complimentary pass
to sin city

this neglected green space
soon to be
an outlet mall

the train
only late
if you’re waiting for it

single lane ahead
my one-track mind

first frost
my unmatched socks

poison ivy
remembering
my first love

not yet autumn
but no one told
the leaves

september call-ups
the tentative
autographs

0 and 2
batter and pitcher
tightening grips

marooned
on his own
private island

breathless
a blue heron
in flight

after the storm
my kingdom
for a cold beer

after the storm
all my promises
up in the air

after the storm
all of my dreams
up in the air

dive bar
the bartender’s
wrinkled tattoo

fingering
the notary’s stamp
on the will

so much to do
a gray squirrel
up and down the tree

equinox
forgetting which of the twins
wears glasses

crescent moon
will she close her eyes
when we kiss?

equinox
i win a game
of solitaire

equinox
my two
left feet

fall arrives
police protect
the wall street bull

waking from a daydream
the first leaves turn

equinox
her naked silhouette

bird droppings
a targeted
air strike

new moon
what we lost
in the fire

after the storm
i savor
the cheap wine

september chill
the girls at the bus stop
roll their eyes

september swoon
unable to get
that third out

infinite
all of the things
i’ll never know

new moon
my old bones
shivering in the dark

new moon
my old bones
in the dark

new moon
i have
no shadow

starless night
her i love you
becomes love you

tropical depression
the dow
loses composure

september chill
a shadow falls
over wall street

the warmth
of an autumn cocktail

fall fantasy
a bed
of leaves

in the waiting room
the tv declares
i am a troubled man

end of september
not yet ready
for octoberfest

writer’s block
the effortlessly
amber sky

writer’s block
filling in the o’s
in an old book

oktoberfest
the bartender’s
overgrown beard

unharvested
since 1995
our neighbor’s lawn

college visit
wondering what the incense
is covering up

fall colors
the conversation
about mom

in the hollowed out skull
of a dead horse
bees make honey

in the waiting room
all emergency exits
blocked

changing colors
lost
on a familiar street

in the unplowed field
a rusty hobby horse

in the waiting room
the magazine model
stares right through me

unimpressed
with this haiku
the sleeping dog

waiting for the train
a blinking light bulb
and me

locking eyes with us
a dog named raven

desert rain
wild flowers
line the arroyo

the battle is joined
chasing a squirrel
from the bird feeder

october rain
wall street
under water

october rain
head bowed
against a quiet window

october rain
the grass on the other side
no longer greener

between
windowless meetings
october rain

smooth jazz
her perfect skin

radio fundraiser
i sing
ain’t too proud to beg

skunky beer
the s&amp;p 500
finishes flat

writer’s block
workers paint over
the graffiti

in the mood
are you thinking
what i’m thinking?

starless night
an unfinished portrait

deep winter
the night
has a thousand eyes

my pet firefly
motionless
in his jar

on a stack
of unread books
i rest my coffee

crowded train
i finish a stranger’s
crossword puzzle

between thunderstorms
the puddle
trembles

gibbous moon
a stray dog’s
unblinking eyes

it must have
been a dream
scent of jasmine

cloudless sky
just a
phone call away

through closed windows
the chattering squirrel
teases the dog

my youngest son
declaring his independence
on a borrowed phone

on a stack
of court opinions
i rest my case

epilogue
to the novel
i’ll never write

all there in black and white
the withered legs of a president

unseasonably warm
just don’t call it
indian summer

last day of september
my baseball cap
in the hamper

migrating geese
watching the
jackpot rise

eyes wide
at a quiet window
the dog waits

autumn twilight
an empty ferry
leaves the dock

harvest moon
her blossoming breasts

boston gridlock
just one more beer

blood moon
my son makes
my father’s face

blood moon
my father’s
wrinkled brow

what a racket!
the amateur mechanic’s
old jalopy

hunter’s moon
the dog
finds a bone

after the storm
the dow
sees daylight

harvest moon
ladies’ night
at the dive bar

harvest moon
unbuttoning
her blouse

unable to sleep
voices
in the dark

unable to sleep
the deepening
darkness

unable to sleep
the dog’s
heavy sigh

piano bar
for dessert i order
too much jelly roll

hours before dawn
the unsteady pulse
in my head

falling to the ground
in the stiff autumn wind
the stock market

rough week on wall street
the rumble of a passing jet

sharing the peace prize
two sleeping puppies

turning up the volume
on a song
i forgot i loved

coney island sunset
dancing in
the fun house mirror

hunting season
a teenaged girl’s
jail bait t-shirt

broken clouds
securing
the storm windows

gibbous moon
the slightest hint
of cleavage

baja sunset
i ask for
the good tequila

driftwood
longing to be
part of something

frost advisory
a gray
eyebrow hair

autumn sun
the day-glo orange
of prison jumpsuits

at the end
of a neighbor’s driveway
a stack of newspapers

blood oranges
an unreturned
phone call

unblinking
the eyes
of a blind man’s dog

columbus day
when there’s nothing left
to discover

descended from wolves
the hollywood starlet’s
fashion accessory

dreaming of retirement
the tired drone
of a leaf blower

pescadero huerta
among the debris
a light

too soon
night

running late
the yoga instructor
cuts me off

conspicuously hidden
on my parents’ book shelf
the joy of sex

unseasonably mild
the mockingbird
with abandon

autumn color
fresh graffiti

happy hour
he reaches for
the unlabeled bottle

approaching storm
the palapero’s
weathered hands

unseasonably warm
a fire sale
on wall street

baja sunset
an alley cat’s
unblinking eyes

out of lime juice
no need to waste
the tequila

asleep on the couch
the underdog
victorious

her bare shoulder
so close
i can taste it

ninth inning
so close
i can taste it

waking from a dream
i board
the wrong train

hunter’s moon
my daughter discovers
a gray hair

before the last
leaf has fallen
jingle bells

fall color
my daughter discovers
a gray hair

between infomercials
a hurricane spins
toward paradise

peak fall color
a shy girl
blushes

autumn moon
two lovers
and their jealous shadows

full of wine
and jealous
of her tight red dress

hours before
the guests arrive
a final game
of solitaire

falling leaves
the weekend exchange
of the children

when i’m happy
i count
flower petals

all of us knowing
where they lead
my mother’s tiny steps

time stands still
my father resumes
his story

morning jog
for me
a spectator sport

hard frost
i fail
an iq test

autumn rain
my mother’s slow descent
down the steps

writer’s block
chopping firewood
with a dull axe

overcast
a former colleague
enters hospice care

cardinal
on a bare tree limb
enlightenment

waiting for the train
a wall street journal
with legs

festival of lights
police establish
a perimeter

crowded train
trying to avoid
a tourist’s selfie

crowded train
photo-bombing
a tourist’s selfie

october rain
i play
a sunny song

october rain
my mother calls me
by my brother’s name

writer’s block
an uncertain sky

late train
a billboard encourages me
to race for the cure

autumn wind
the ringing
in my ears

writer’s block
all the
unraked leaves

after the storm
a dog toy
under the bed

alone
in the abandoned train station
of my dreams

crescent moon
my father’s
firm handshake

street jam
and no place
to leave a tip

the last train home
wondering who the dog
is waiting for

autumn sunset
calling an end
to his cancer treatment

happy hour
her cleavage
deepens

a curse upon this land!
i bring an extra poop bag

fair-weather clouds
pretending her smile
is for me

lost
in the opium haze
of her eyes

a dream
i joined the circus
and no one
voted for me

an enduring image
the brooklyn
i never knew

3-and-0
she gives me
the green light

seventh inning stretch
my aching back

outside juvenile court
sparrows
build a nest

writer’s block
an old oak
without leaves

writer’s block
an old oak tree
stripped of its leaves

unable to sleep
the all-night laundromat
of my past

overcast
the doctor says
it’s just an age spot

restless night
an idling
truck engine

one week before elections
i avoid
the politician’s handshake

falling leaves
my mother trails off
mid-sentence

crescent moon
the junkyard dog’s
tired howl

just trying
to blend in
crow

election season
crows fighting
over stale bread

that moment
when her shoulder strap
falls

red wine
the taste
of her lips

my halloween costume
the assertion
that i’m glad to be here

day of the dead
she thinks i don’t know
what black candy is

now accepting
new patients
the abandoned hospital

island girl
her pretty fingers
stirring my cocktail

island time
i take off
my watch

happy enough to know
it’s raining
somewhere

game seven
the last
of the wine

halloween morning
superman waits
for the school bus

halloween night
satan
tending bar

devil’s night
another political ad

devil’s night
the baby’s colic

a leaf falls
the long
journey home

halloween traffic
all of the zombies
behind the wheel

halloween night
a priest and a witch
walk into a bar

the look on his face
when she says
i don’t believe in love

halloween night
dimming the lights she whispers
trick or treat?

the last day
of daylight savings
slow steady rain

day of the dead
the dog
corners a moth

día de los muertos
the elegant cheek bones
of a well-bred ghost

día de los muertos
her elegant cheek bones

first snow
a blizzard
of facebook updates

all soul’s day
a dead sparrow
at my feet

election week
a tattered flag

winning at solitaire
nobody notices
i’ve grown a beard

november dusk
shadows lengthen
into haiku cliché

killing frost
the laughter
grows silent

election day
i choose
to wear black

election day
freshly raked leaves
in the wind

election day
an extra poop bag
for the dog walk

election day
the weather
unchanged

overcast
the challenger
concedes

washington gridlock
back by popular demand

democracy
voting
the rascals in

leaning against
the subway wall
a runaway sax solo

november rain
a homeless man
and his puppy

crowded waiting room
because my privacy
is important

full moon
my empty
wine glass

lost in the wind
my train of thought

after the argument
driving home
in the dark

slipping from my hands
my world’s greatest dad
coffee mug

crowded supermarket
checking out
the check-out girls

island dreams
she answers
yes

fair-weather clouds
knowing that her smile
is not for me

knowing
that her smile
is not for me

quiet morning
until the dog
sees a squirrel

old cemetery
i remember
a bad joke

the darkest night
a hallway
of shatter-proof glass

waking from a nightmare
the night
of broken glass

imperial stout
the waitress’ curves
soften

a mouse
in a rat trap
early snow

through tattered curtains
a poor man’s sunshine

veteran’s day
no more soldiers
in my toy box

a distant drumbeat
maybe my great grandchildren
won’t know war

joining the protest
an overripe mango

frost on the windshield
i savor
the tequila burn

veteran’s day
an empty shot glass

veteran’s day
the old dog’s
gray muzzle

waking from a nightmare
a field of poppies

early morning meditation
i’ve forgotten
my mantra

asleep
on the subway floor
the unknown soldier

flashing lights
i don’t remember
boarding this train

morning fog
an empty
tequila bottle

happy hour
two girlfriends
compare love lives

darker than night
these toxic dreams

gibbous moon
time for that talk
with your ghost

rain changes to snow
she offers to buy me
a drink

rain changes to snow
she whispers her room number
in my ear

windless night
the sign blinks
live girls

november dusk
the scars
on her wrists

first snow
something
i shouldn’t have said

call from the front desk
is this dog yours?

waiting for the bus
a three-legged dog
wagging its tail

first snow
she asks me
to be gentle

autumn dusk
a boxcar
waiting

dangerous highway
the shadows
know my name

reflecting the beer light
the exotic dancer’s
dead eyes

shots fired
a log popping
in the wood stove

crowded train
she blows a kiss
beyond me

greasy spoon
dried-out flowers
in the window sill

vegan restaurant
ordering
between parentheses

snow flurries
and to think
we almost kissed

lights out
the mannequin
dreams

crescent moon
i finally
remember her

sad news
the dog’s head
on my lap

winter fog
never knowing
what to say

unlabeled
a grief
stronger than moonshine

sad news
somehow sadder
that i get
to change the channel

november rain
another slice
of pizza

late night
an empty fortune cookie

lonely highway
i lose
myself

snipping the last rose
another cup of coffee

killing frost
a rose
bows its head

black friday
what would
jesus do?

unrelenting cold
sharing my pillow
with the dog

deep chill
my darkest secrets

dead inside
she wears
a strong perfume

darkening my day
her name and number
on my cell phone

almost sexy
smoke rings
from your lips

late night
the cleaning crew
come and gone

junk email
santa needs
a spellchecker

the last straw
stirring
my margarita

building ever taller fences
a nation of immigrants

moonless night
a child’s funeral

shutting off
the christmas music
i remove her bow

reaching for the remote
i touch your hand

continued cold
she walks
right on by

her smile when i tell her
she would make
a beautiful corpse

bad news
an extra dash of bitters
in my cocktail

emptiness
the bottom
of the bottle

thanksgiving rain
the dog
no one wanted

november dusk
she doesn’t want
to talk about it

new moon
the doctor schedules
a biopsy

brooklyn heights
a pit bull straining
against the leash

no offense she says
but you don’t look
puerto rican

persistent drizzle
surrendering
to the iv

one generation
too late
punk rock girl

a noisy chickadee
i missed
the question

autumn sun
the dog’s ear
twitches

autumn sunset
unable to hear
the silence

bacon in the pan
the dog’s
wagging tail

new moon
a stranger
unfriends me

wishing
i remembered it
wet dream

winter moths
a typo
in his obituary

evening meditation
rehearsing
tomorrow’s argument

alone at the bar
the missing letters
in a neon sign

awaiting the verdict
we hang up
christmas lights

storm watch
a city
on fire

waterloo sunset
a swarm
of impatient commuters

snow in the forecast
a busy supermarket
with empty shelves

thanksgiving eve
a birthday reminder
for a deceased friend

rain changes to snow
the first christmas card

admiring his garden
i explain
what a nor’easter is

they say
i have his eyes
the grandfather
i never met

clinging
everywhere it should
that dress

first snow
overzealous
plows

thanksgiving eve
celebrating
a band called death

thanksgiving rain
the unblinking eyes
of a shelter dog

thanksgiving night
an empty parking lot
at the nursing home

silent snow
her nightshirt
unbuttoned

black friday
the first
christmas card

mother’s little helper
asleep
on the kitchen floor

cue the scary music
someone’s in the kitchen
with dinah

waking from a dream
the amusement park
on fire

under the bridge
dreaming that the dog
found a home

my dream self
begging for change
in the city of ghosts

a patch of ice
my least favorite dance

driving in a strange town
lost for words

dirty snow
the dog
makes it dirtier

in a basket
beneath the ceiba tree
a mother dog and her puppies

border crossing
grandpa explains
what mordida means

setting sun
the officer asks me
not to call it a bribe

christmas spirit
tied to the roof
of a late model chevy

winter warm-up
the snow man
breaks a sweat

rush hour
a train
races its shadow

enlightenment
a police car
on fire

my hometown
explaining to the grandchildren
what a library was

cyber monday
a wireless mouse
in the ceiling

democracy in action
burning our leaders
in effigy

jasmine dreams
an open window
far away

the silence
when i’m asked
to say grace

over margaritas
my broken spanish
and pantomime

december rain
the dog won’t give up
his toy

fear
killing an
innocent man

ice storm
a budding romance
on hold

first snow
reaching up
to touch it

even she eyes me
disapprovingly
the headless mannequin

holiday cocktail
last year’s christmas tree
on ice

december snow
the whispering brook

tropical dreams
the lone and level sands
stretch far away

telling her
i’m the invisible man
she sees right through me

sniffing the tripod
a three-legged dog

taking the plunge
her neckline

dark nights
knowing that someone
is watching

long drive ahead
the bartender
cuts me off

my faithful browser
so concerned
about my penis size

at the end of the bar
a stockbroker
liquidates his assets

no place to go
extra icing
on the christmas cookies

no place to go
extra ice
in my cocktail

winter rain
something
i’m forgetting

bitter moon
of course
we can be friends

young love
a side of her
i haven’t seen

fifteen years later
vapors of morphine

deep red wine
her luscious lips

writer’s block
picking up a penny
when nobody’s looking

lazy morning
the puppy pretends
to be asleep

cold wind
the christmas lights
shiver

forgetting that today
was the day
that will live in infamy

approaching cold front
silent night blaring
on the radio

twilight
my father’s
mom jeans

game on
the sock thief
wags his tail

losing myself
in a labyrinth
of solitude

winter storm warning
the protests
won’t stop

approaching nor’easter
pitchers and catchers report
in 68 days

mixed precipitation
she tells me i look good
for my age

bad karaoke
the guinness
goes flat

waiting for the bus
a layer of snow
on my wet sneakers

christmas party
a layer of dust
on the plastic mistletoe

christmas party
a layer of dust
on the fake mistletoe

winter rain
the blood
in the streets

market correction
i decide not to get
the four-dollar latte

losing at solitaire
it was never
in the cards for me

asking the ocean
whose lost dog
am i?

christmas party
a layer of dust
on the mistletoe

the smile
when she tells me
i’m like a brother to her

steady snowfall
never knowing
what to say

light snowfall
the dog’s head
on my lap

blasting quadrophenia
the cop lets me off
with a warning

christmas epiphany
i’ve been following
the wrong star

bad beer
the stock market
goes flat

winter twilight
a stranger asks me
if i’m in pain

darkness
drinking
the shame away

end of the work week
walking on the shells
of my nest egg

first-world nightmare
a lemon
at the apple store

early shopper
forgetting where
he hid the gift

running through the graveyard
you’re innocent
when you dream

up in the air
my lofty ambitions

winter dusk
too cold
for a meteor shower

season’s greetings
opening a christmas card
i get a paper cut

the dog’s
favorite spot
between us

over the moon
the coney island cyclone

pondering
the definition of agile
i run into a wall

the sudden chill
a fresh layer of ice
on the fire escape

mid-december
the moon
also waning

ten days until christmas
the inevitable breakdown
between t stops

clutching darkness
the last train will roll
with or without you

just when i needed it
the puppy’s wagging tail

today’s forecast
the puppy’s
wagging tail

end of the year
detecting a leak
in my bucket list

winter rain
the christmas tree angel
bows its head

winter rain
all my regrets
on radar

alone
the last
christmas tree

watered-down cocktails
the unescorted escort
plays angry birds

writer’s block
a broken
log splitter

searching for words
i haven’t said
pigeons

lighting up a cuban
we start talking politics

the old stone church
a recent convert
to luxury condos

nobody’s christmas gift
a sato dog

midnight
times square
winks at me

night after night
drinking
the monotony away

restless night
a playlist
of sad songs

his vodka
his marriage
on the rocks

defying gravity
her strapless gown

winter solstice
my lighthearted haiku
grows dark

solstice
drinking
the night

last train
the lonely wind

longest night
a dog howling
at the stars

a solstice toast
to brighter days ahead

wrapping christmas gifts
i spike the egg nog

new moon
she dances
alone

leaping
to its death
a shooting star

lover’s leap
an abandoned car
still running

new moon
the police dog’s
wagging tail

sidewalk steam
a dead rat
in the cat’s mouth

equinox
the dog
between us

the animal shelter
when the christmas music
stops

late-night diner
now serving
emptiness

market rally
so many last-minute
christmas shoppers

my darkest dream
lightning
strikes the church

last call
leaning against
a tired piano

christmas eve
santa takes
a smoke break

christmas eve
santa lights
a cheap cigar

christmas eve
santa buys
another round

a break in the clouds
my granddaughter laughs

last-minute shopping
wal-mart jesus
and family

early dusk
a burned-out string
of christmas lights

spreading christmas cheer
santa
in a short skirt

christmas sunset
the children ask
if there are more gifts

love at first sight
the dog
and my dinner

christmas dusk
the box of decorations
we never put up

now what?
the cloudless sky

resistance
on both ends of the leash
this year’s christmas present

but i thought
they were your friends?
christmas card mystery

struggling
at the end of the leash
this year’s christmas present

winter dusk
taking inventory
of the liquor supply

winter twilight
all of the empty
bird nests

assuring the hot feminist
i don’t consider her an object

the dog lifts his leg
over a discarded
christmas wreath

redundant redundancy
she asks
what is the ask?

baja dreams
the beach sand
between my toes

there she goes
the perfect song

christmas leftovers
my mother forgets
why she called

with one last sip
of a tropical cocktail
the tide rolls in

wind chill advisory
an old girlfriend
visits my website

water tower place
imagining
her silhouette

laundry day
the search
for matching socks

back to work
i finally win
at solitaire

winter darkness
so many empty cans
to fill the void

phone call from my son
the folly of my youth
revisited

last train to brooklyn
a stray dog
sleeps

tumbleweed
longing for
a place to call home

red light
lovers stop
to kiss

tumbleweed
longing for a place
to call home

wolf moon
i tweeze
my eyebrows

before the resolutions kick in
a rush to the liquor store

matrix management
moving forward
in all directions

new year’s eve
waiting for
my eyelids to drop

new year’s eve
waiting for
the other shoe
to drop

new year’s day
a poor man’s sunshine

new year’s day
the same old me
in the mirror

toasting
the year’s
first hangover

commuters ignoring
the perfect sax solo

lost
in a land
without horizons

profile photo
a disembodied hand
on her shoulder

fever dream
that moment when
her eyes said yes

never mind
the wolf moon
a sleeping dog

deep winter
wishing on a star
whose name i used to know

wishing on a star
whose name
i used to know

epiphany
a belated
christmas card

a perfect circle
every shadow
out of place

first snow
the silence

first snow
salt on the rim
of a margarita glass

snow changes to rain
i open
the last beer

snow changes to rain
opening
the last beer

outside the state house
a stray dog
searching for crumbs

wading through the slush
i crave a margarita

wolf moon
suddenly i see her
in a different light

reconciliation
a very long word

last of the tequila
a familiar melody

cold snap
smokers
puffing faster

deep winter
the bears come out
on wall street

still raw
where the tattoo
was removed

cold snap
the junkyard dog’s
heavy chain

epiphany
the stars
we follow

vip lounge
three kings
with gold chains

closing my eyes
scent of magnolias
sweet and fresh

as i drown
the running
of the bulls

behind the mask
a rabbit
afraid of the wind

bitter cold
the eyes
of a feral cat

snow squall
an exgirlfriend
reminisces

continued cold
the dog sleeps
between us

deepest winter
i no longer
see my breath

sailing the seas
of my subconscious
her fishnet stockings

paris moonrise
the devil
mocked

approaching snow
the shivering
thermostat

cold front
so much warmer
in that tight blouse

dreaming about
our winter vacation
a mango falls

heavy snow
in my daydreams
a mango falls

ripe mangoes
remembering
my first girlfriend

freedom trail
closed for repairs

costly
but priceless
free speech

paradise
roman candles
across the sky

urban incense
a steaming
manhole cover

waking from a dream
i go back
to who i am

a respite from the cold
winter rain

almost blue
she whispers
let’s get lost

cool jazz
the mood turns
black and white

cool jazz
the contours
of her shoulders

hopping the next train
a drunkard’s lullaby

crawling across
the priceless mosaic
a common house fly

baja cantina
trying to explain
what sleet is

between meetings
traffic slows
to a standstill

a long meeting
permanent marker
on the erasable whiteboard

cubicle maze
a daydream
of daylight

visions of spam
winning a contest
i didn’t enter

spam

to claim your prize

wind chill advisory
she sees me staring
at her legs

bad hop
the shortstop
sings soprano

cutting through the pasture
i find out
what a meadow muffin is

mixed precipitation
a flat finish
on wall street

half moon
something
i’m forgetting

my dream
to dream as deeply
as my dog

awake before the alarm
i can’t remember
my dream

shots fired
a log pops
in the fireplace

cold snap
the crunch of road salt
in an empty pub

my hometown
a stray dog navigates
the cracked sidewalks

how a bill becomes a law
a skunk carcass in the street

sipping absinthe
an impressionist painting
of night

promise me
you’ll never tame
your wild hair

winter fog
struggling to remember
the sound of the ocean

winter mist
the oppressive
silence

winter mist
drinking
in silence

winter mist
i won’t miss
winter

young love
the taste
of peppermint

negative space
the artist’s
unpainted walls

hot jazz
she lets
her hair down

winter fog
an unmatched
pair of socks

does the cardinal not know
it’s too cold
to be colorful?

letting go
of yesterday’s rain
the wind-swept palms

checking my meeting schedule
a persistent mosquito

snow turns to rain
my dreams
turn to baseball

late for work
the loud gossip
of chickadees

routine traffic stop
the police officer’s
favorite song

vacation
without the dog
the wind howls

the president and me
the same waning moon

memories of grandma
the mothballed closet

state of the union
another burned-out light bulb

state of the union
an abandoned car
on easy street

state of the union
separate beds

unable to sleep
unable to stay awake
the jet engine’s serenade

stranded on the runway
the pale blue sky
of your eyes

stranded on the runway
the pale blue sky

cold stethoscope
i lie to the doctor
about my drinking

cruising altitude
that three-beer buzz

noisy children on the plane
my tinnitus
fails me

winning at solitaire
i forget
my first girlfriend’s name

air turbulence
i contemplate
my autobiography

floating on clouds
the emptiness

still trying to process
that conversation we had
in a dream

addicting
the junkie’s
memoir

final approach
should i have zigged
instead of zagged?

music festival
the mariachi band’s
marshall amps

hold me
close enough
to hear the ocean

hold me closer
and you will hear
the ocean

shining through
the palapa roof
baja sunlight

telling his younger girlfriend
about the old days
a coconut falls

baja morning
the birds roll their rs
better than i do

baja sunset
shadows chase
the gecko away

barrio dog
hunting
for shade

recurring nightmare
a screen door
slamming in the wind

she tells me she’s close
that faraway look

i’ve said too much
a hole
in the palapa roof

tightening my grip
on the steering wheel
another roadside memorial

tightening my grip
another roadside memorial

wrong turn
a three-legged dog
chasing cars

baja rain
the last time
we made love

baja rain
the waves become
a passing truck

mediodía
four dogs
under a broken tree

wedding procession
two caballeros
in traffic

withering sun
old men trying
to look young

science
icarus
ascending

free admission
stray dogs
and gray ponytails

one last beer
fly
on a cactus needle

freezing the stars
coyote song

evidently it’s me
who’s out of place
dog on the roof

tentative sunlight
somebody’s paradise
abandoned

thundering ocean
she begs me
not to leave

friendly skies
security confiscates
my corkscrew

magnets he replies
to a question
i didn’t ask

blizzard warning
the dog finds a hole
in the pillow

whiteout
her lies

let it snow she said,
leaving her nightgown behind

blizzard warning
her insincere praise

meteor shower
forgetting the name
of my first love

also falling today
the dow

lost in a snowdrift
our baja glow

snow day
wondering
what my dog is thinking

nor’easter
what a great name
for a horrible cocktail

back to work
i map out
the next snow storm

a dream
beyond
these broken walls

between meetings
another word
for snow

waking from a nightmare
the hallways
of shatter-proof glass

nor’easter
the carpenter’s
leaky roof

dressing in the dark
i put my watch on
upside-down

more snow to come
we toast
with cheap wine

dancing across
the empty zócalo
a plastic cup

dancing across
the empty plaza
a plastic cup

spitting out watermelon seeds
i forget it’s not summer

fresh snow
the sound of sleigh bells
in my dreams

escalating tensions
the dog
stalks a squirrel

january ends
an icy patch
on wall street

pink drink
i lean forward
for a kiss

effervescence
the drinker’s peace

after the flood
doll clothes
in a tree

paradise tree
a mourning dove
without its mate

purple sunset
a mourning dove
without its mate

waiting for the train
the billboard model’s
magic marker mustache

super bowl saturday
a linebacker blitz
at the deli counter

asked how
i want my steak cooked
i reply right now

february first
a snow-covered
flower stand

tomorrow’s storm
now predicted to be
more than one six-pack

super bowl sunday
a goal-line stand
at the liquor store

groundhog day
i think i’ve seen
this snow before

groundhog day
i’ve seen
this snow before

amber sunset
an abandoned dream

fresh snow
she asks me
to make a wish

the bitterness
no place
to put the snow

snow on the way
an expectant father
pacing nervously

snowdrift
the desert oasis
of my dreams

under all those blankets
a winter wonderland

snow moon
wondering what they call it
everywhere else

beyond these broken walls
my darkest secrets

returning my stare
the naked mannequin

snow piled high
a flat finish
on wall street

preparing for take-off
a crying baby
non-stop

tired dream
dressing sharp
feeling dull

wind chill advisory
the eviction notice’s
bright red letters

cold gray sky
the cat
i gave away

cold snap
a shot of brandy
to keep me warm

tie game
his nonchalant
flip of the bat

snow in the forecast
an empty fortune cookie

deep winter
dreaming
of butterflies

writer’s block
a scratched-out
lottery ticket

office move
acquainting myself
with the nearest exit

dirty snow
time to work
on our taxes

dirty snow
it must be time
to do our taxes

dirty snow
the candidate announces
an exploratory committee

the puzzled faces
when a native new yorker
asks for a hero

guarding
the abandoned silver mine
a one-eyed cat

el triunfo
a flock of goats
crosses the highway

beneath the deep snow
our late dog’s footprints

nuclear standoff
the last jar
of hot sauce

spring training dreams
i grip
a snowball

spring training
i grip
a snowball

freedom trail
a dog
without a collar

stranded at the station
a three-legged dog
and me

defying every storm
a dozen roses

beautifully wasted
the one
most likely to succeed

between meetings
a growing snowdrift

skyscraper sunrise
things
are looking up

hunger moon
she nonchalantly
removes her bra

unrest in the streets
snowmelt
with nowhere to go

morning afterglow
the beautiful mess
of your hair

weather channel
jeering
the european model

writer’s block
the ice dam
drips

budget airline
now serving
no one

denying global warming
the politician’s
fat cigar

ice dam
my mother forgets
why she called

empty
the world’s most costly
parking spot

plowed into
menacing mountains
the hate

first date
the silence
when she asks me to dance

throwback thursday
the one
who got away

sunset
just one more
last beer

snowbound
wondering when the gray hairs
first outnumbered the black

always off-key
a choir
of snow blowers

snow fatigue
the porch roof sags

spring training
the snowman’s
baseball bat

south station
the street musician plays
train in vain

full of hope
i aspirate
my wine

first date
the silence
when i mention baseball

full of hope
i aspirate

wheels spinning
i deny
that i am stuck

windswept snow
my drifting thoughts

trendy nightclub
debutantes
in uniform

zombie movie
the unblinking eyes

hot jazz
the trumpet player
licks his lips

blizzard warning
my thoughts
drift to baseball

winter dreams
what lies beneath
that thick wool sweater

nobody’s valentine
a sato dog

news of his passing
a player piano
plays the blues

boarded-up saloon
no place
to play the blues

valentine’s day
a kiss
from the dog

shivering
a bird’s nest
in the blizzard

writer’s block
anything
but snow

contentment
my one shade of gray

contentment
becoming one shade of gray

contentment
a single shade of white

tired of this movie
a single shade
of white

deep winter
who taught the wind
how to whistle?

the key to his success
a two-headed nickel

always the vagabond
drifting snow

spring in the air
a distant galaxy

meanwhile
in a distant galaxy
baseball

new moon
the bully’s
bloody nose

laissez les bons temps rouler
a snowman
wearing mardi gras beads

mardi gras
a craving
for bacon

bourbon street webcam
a long night’s journey
to oblivion

new moon
a toast
to absent friends

fat tuesday
her soft curves

sketchy motel
the neon sign reads
no va

ice dams
the need for something else
to write about

crescent moon
closing her eyes
when we kiss

crescent moon
a junkie
on the nod

too much wine
hanging my dreams
on the crescent moon

only on facebook
a stranger invites me
to play games

ash wednesday
smokers
bow their heads

early autumn
the golden highlights
in her green hair

words fail me
windswept snow

new moon
a side of her
i hadn’t seen

coldest night
i tell her there’s nothing
beyond that door

white out
an empty page
in my haiku notebook

end of the week
sharing
a yawn

mountain rain
the instant rage
of the arroyo

desert dream
reaching for
the moon

wind chill advisory
i show her
my death poems

not hearing
a word i say
the newlyweds

spring training
just how much tobacco?

approaching storm
the rookie’s fastball

snow day
a dog toy
pressed against my leg

her smile
an icicle falls

smile!
an icicle falls

out of gas
the snow shoveler

in the mirror
the cracks
on my face

oscar night
the kids pretend
to sleep

oscar night
she tells me
she’s not faking

after the storm
the streets
have no names

where she used to live
an empty bird feeder

frozen in time
my granddaughter’s
ice cream smile

crescent moon
the hawk answers
its call

nagging me awake
the impatient crow

veto threat
the dog
hears us kiss

crescent moon
i never told you
my name

cheap date
a shooting star

after the gold rush
a three-legged dog
on main street

towering
above the ruins
a town called triumph

ice dams dripping
in time with frozen

drunk before noon
he for whom
the bell tolls

snowless night
turning water
into champagne

shoveling
more partly cloudy
from the driveway

rush hour
three deep
at the bar

halfway up
the narrow staircase
my sleeper sofa

too drunk
to play his second set
the blues legend

opening the envelope
another awkward moment

welcoming me aboard
a rudderless boat

dreaming away
the water stains
on the ceiling

high school reunion
all the girls
who neglected me

running on fumes
how many miles
to the next mirage?

cancelled flight
the ice dam
unmoved

near the bottom
of the snowmelt
enlightenment

enlightenment
near the bottom
of the snowmelt

on hold
the soundtrack
to hell

later than we think
the transvestite’s
drooping eyelash

climbing the snowbank
the siren’s
red glare

an oasis
in the bible belt
adult book store

found
the kind of bar
i could die in every night

vacancy
my motel
meditation

weathered and pale
the service dog’s vest

up in the air
where we’ll lay
our heads tonight

lax
all the tired
palm trees

at the hotel bar
businessmen
busily texting

happy hour
businessmen compare
travel delays

is this love?
she doesn’t
recognize me

l.a. sunrise
the windmills
motionless

century boulevard
a continuum
of gray

california rain
remember
to breathe

also pointing
to the sea
water spout

all my dreams
silhouetted
against the waves

cheap date
drinking
the silence

spring break
how many whiskeys
to fix it?

odd man out
the old dog
too tired to play

pointing the way
to paradise
baja cactus

baja rain
a gecko laughs
at sunbathers

baja cactus
pointing the way
to paradise

after the rain
a songbird
answers my call

momentarily
washed out to sea
the bitter cold

waxing moon
her lips
already full

scrambled eggs
i examine
my retirement portfolio

baja breeze
the contours
beneath her sundress

baja breeze
her undulating
sundress

standing in the arroyo
a monument
to what?

buried in the sand
a message
in an empty bottle

never too soon
baja sunrise

crow moon
not a crow
in sight

office move
acquainting myself
with all the exits

standing in the arroyo
a monument
to whom?

half-buried in the sand
no message
in the bottle

half-buried in the sand
is there a message
in the bottle?

writer’s block
a horse
in the road

unable to sleep
the moon
and me

pitchers’ duel
a seagull soars over
the green monster

stock market report
gulls disappear
beyond the sand dune

writer’s block
a sand crab
disappears

wearing only moonlight
my baja lover

stock market report
a gecko laughs
unseen

stray dog
from shadow
to shadow

desert flower
last
of the tequila

baja cantina
nobody’s cat
right at home

end of the road
three big dogs
with nothing to do

the old routine
polishing the guitar
i can’t play

ghost town
a rooster crows
for no reason at all

abandoned mining town
a playground
for ghosts

towering above
the ruins
fair-weather clouds

daylight savings
one hour
poorer again

also too sad
to see us leave
baja sun

overcast
time to check the weather
back home

spring breakers
all recounting
their spring benders

turbulence
a wild ride
on wall street

crowded plane
another game
of solitaire

snow bank
still waiting
for a withdrawal

just when i thought
i had arrived
a door within a door

back to work
the dog digs a tennis ball
out of the snow

false spring
burning a bridge
before it is crossed

on either side
of the broken sky
clouds

false spring
a distant train

false spring
she covers up
her cleavage

false spring
my computer
freezes

police sirens
the dog climbs
into our bed

fog
the faintest scent
of jasmine

back to work
the cat
taunts the dog

wondering if the walls knew
it could all come tumbling down

winter thaw
the snowbank
and its secrets

winter thaw
the secrets
in her smile

penguin dust
there are unfavorable omens
in the sky!

penguin dust
unfavorable omens
in the sky

between meetings
a quick game
of solitaire

black ice
a moment
of clarity

jet lag
wishing i
could fly away

pay day
refilling
the bird feeder

dirty snow
the senator
resigns

live on c-span
a fat squirrel
at the bird feeder

a town called triumph
if these whitewashed walls
could speak

winter rain
my granddaughter’s first steps
on facebook

the ides of march
the dog won’t
bring the ball back

winter rain
an email
in upper case letters

my last dime
the beggar curses
in thanks

winter rain
everything
i thought it would be

between meetings
that deal i didn’t make
with the devil

balancing act
the city boy
and the ocean

balancing act
the city boy
on a surfboard

desert haze
the unlabeled bottle

grapefruit league
old timers bemoaning
the designated hitter

do they know
something i don’t?
daffodils

cool jazz
now that she has
my undivided attention

crashing waves
an open window
far away

a recurring dream
in which i can’t enjoy
the party

snow squalls
beware
the ides of march

late winter thaw
she stops adjusting
her falling bra strap

overcast
my unshaved face

winter drizzle
only the dog
wants to get out of bed

drunk among the trees
can i please have
more days like this

they say i have his eyes
the grandfather
i never met

cloudless sky
my grandfather’s eyes

writer’s block
a housefly trapped
between window panes

dirty snow
the politician
ignoring questions

moonrise
all my rowdy friends
have settled down

treasuring the love letters
you wrote to me
in invisible ink

rain
i wait
for nothing

abandoned silver mine
damiana in bloom

march thaw
the cascade
of a freshly-poured guinness

march thaw
a freshly-poured guinness

restless sleep
new sounds
from the old dog

my childhood photos
mysteriously missing
from grandma’s brag book

wind advisory
a political fundraiser
in town

minor league batting practice
seagulls shag fly balls

hot prospect
radar guns
in unison

unable to sleep
the restless waves
so far away

she tells me
she’s part gypsy
the winter wind

writer’s block
a frog on the shore
of the old pond

continued cold
an open shot
bounces off the rim

first day of spring
i thought i’d seen the last
of the snow

a sudden draft
i dream of you
naked

equinox
i drink alone

spring at last
my grandson asks me
if my guitar has a name

spring in the air
or is that snow?

spring snow
one more log
for the fire

desert dream
the dog
who never left

crescent moon
the rookie’s
nasty curve

total eclipse
lost
in a familiar city

melting snow
forgetting the world
is upside down

beneath the snowmelt
an improbable beach ball

sparrows crowding
the empty bird feeder

total eclipse
the last
of the brandy

fresh from the oven
the missing dog toy

the look on her face
when i ask her
what’s cooking?

dreams of spring
a sky
full of kites

crescent moon
a hawk calls
to itself

wandering off the path
i find my way

low tide
the loud gossip
of seagulls

low tide
gossiping seagulls

santurce dream
the sizzle
of sofrito

freshly plowed field
the farmer’s daughter
smiles at me

sweet sixteen
the long bus ride home

false spring
the rookie
mulls retirement

in the recovery room
i win consecutive games
of solitaire

between shots of brandy
sunset

dirty snow
declaring
his candidacy

strong as an ox
his body odor

snowmelt
already listening
for crickets

changing a tire
i wonder how
to reinvent myself

laughing at
the buddha statue
a well-fed baby

farmer’s market
tie-dye
and gray pony-tails

peals of thunder
cattle dogs
at play

thin ice
is today the day
i crack?

sleepwalking
i dream
about sleepwalking

the bitterness
at the bottom
of the bottle

standing tall
desert cactus

play ball!
my trusty bat
behind snow shovels

promise of spring
walking the dog
in the rain

march madness
the shot
from an impossible angle

march madness
an impossible angle

spring snow
a little too in touch
with my feelings

spring mud
the coffee
not quite right

second honeymoon
holding her close
i hear the ocean

holding her close
i hear the ocean

spring snow
wondering where
i went wrong

at the end of the bar
he speaks of the sirens
we don’t hear

dive bar
the sirens
we don’t hear

first date
our naked
shadows

asked if
i would do it all again
i say nothing

when she told me
she was the end of the rainbow
i sadly agreed

shopping for easter
she calls me
her cross to heaven

palm sunday
a stranger
shakes my hand

too late for happy hour
another loser
at lucky’s lounge

march madness
headless mannequin
in a pastel dress

palm sunday
my aching head
in my hands

spring snow
accumulating
clichés

slow blues
the keyboard player
in another time zone

crossroads
stroking the hair
she asks me to pull

blood moon
the silence
of my sons

sweet dreams
finding
that groove

my life’s work
an empty
champagne glass

march madness
another snow squall

tearing up a lottery ticket
i write my next haiku

between sighs
planning
my next dream

not that i’d recognize them
but i long
for cherry blossoms

through all this talk
about bulls and bears
the dog sleeps

april fool
i shouldn’t have laughed
when she said i love you

motionless
while the jukebox plays
train kept a rollin’

wiping
their plastic noses
a clown’s funeral

april fool
the grass on the other side
is mud

gibbous moon
the glass
nearly empty

spring training
nobody’s seen
the rookie’s lucky bat

restless dreams
the waves
so far away

life of the party
they all wince
when i sneeze

sunrise
graffiti
in the zen garden

late for work
the intern
cuts me off

filing my taxes
a field
of dandelions

a voice from the past
the sky neither gray
nor not gray

cheap champagne
my granddaughter’s
college fund

spring thaw
a song i thought
i’d forgotten

rock, paper, scissors
my turn
to sleep on the couch

good friday
an empty
stretch of road

good friday
fresh flowers
at a roadside shrine

good friday
a roadside shrine

lost weekend
teaching my daughter
to parallel park

drunk before noon
another quarter
in the broken jukebox

pink moon
my youngest granddaughter’s
first steps

unfriended
and yet
the moon

tide’s end
the mystery woman
in the photo

the woman on the bench
who just wanted
to be left alone

park bench
an old man staring
at nothing

rising from the dead
my teenage son’s
first hangover

easter egg hunt
because all the good girls
are in church

warming trend
her bare shoulders

my life’s work
a crumpled
lottery ticket

april fool’s day
the plans
we make

standing between us
a wall
of empty cans

pink moon
my granddaughters’
easter dresses

jingling in my pocket
a ring of keys
to who knows where

paying my taxes
the pen
runs dry

opening day
crocuses in bloom

opening day
no reply
to my email

opening day
everything
is possible

opening day
just one
more button

lost
a pay phone in the desert
out of service

lost
my passion
for passion fruit

whistling through
a hollow skull
desert wind

headline out of washington
wild turkeys
in the road

spring rain
throwing away a key
i might need some day

announcing his candidacy
i remember to empty
the compost bucket

twilight
a pair of eyes peeks
from the dead oak

insert wise crack here
a power outage
at the white house

insert punchline here
a power outage
at the white house

opening day
two old men argue
about the designated hitter

spring snow
a dog toy
in my bed

cardinal song
to what do i owe
this honor?

the verdict
guilty
of being alive

the verdict
guilty of celebrating
the verdict

mixed precipitation
ice pellets
on my baseball cap

spring cleaning
letters
i keep putting back

rites of spring
a new
woodchuck hole

for only a moment
hummingbird

winter fog
the cold medicine
wears off

writer’s block
a meeting
to discuss impediments

rip tide
i change
my mind

sleepless night
the deafening
silence

steady drizzle
deleting the prizes
i may have already won

dressed for success
she finally
undresses

perfect game
a father’s smile

a perfect pour
the heavenward cascade
of a guinness

beyond the clouds
a perfect moon

the perfect body
is the one
next to mine

the perfect body
next to mine

close game
the closer’s
long beard

extra innings
was that
a wink?

fresh graffiti
on the bank wall
jesus saves

spring sunset
the color
of this very strong beer

flying from his drumsticks
the street musician’s sweat

urban shelter
a lost dog
sees right through me

twilight
i am that strange car
across the street

under the snow pile
everyone else’s trash

running from sirens
the boys of summer

opening day
announcing the retirement
of the snow shovel

standing in the arroyo
the silence
whispers

long after sunset
she glitters

grand entrance
the cat’s
question-mark tail

cherry blossoms
unnamed pending notification
of next of kin

dressed for success
she undresses

game of thrones
a long line
to the bathroom

monday morning hangover
i decline
another meeting

efficient government
my tax check
promptly deposited

monday morning hangover
a man shouting at his cell phone
in the next stall

opening day
loosening the top button
of her blouse

your words
where the fly
was smashed

was it all a dream?
the constellations
in the sky

spring overcast
i avoid a club
in which i’m a member

taking it personally
a rejection letter
addressed to applicant

dream interrupted
an ominous
ocean breeze

a stray dog
where the merry-go-round
used to be

young love
a light
in the huerta

lovers
in the huerta

dinner music
my granddaughter playing
pots and pans

mother’s little helper
the dog’s
unblinking eye

at the health club
the petite girl’s
firm handshake

tax day
i ignore
the check-engine light

road closed by protesters
the fear of being
on the wrong side

every spring i ask
if those are daffodils

dusk
where i learned to read
an empty warehouse

midnight
finally drunk enough
to hear the ocean

everything
they don’t say
footprints

remembering the last time
we played in the rain

imminent rain
watching the sky
for nothing

day lilies
never knowing
what to say

writer’s block
what i didn’t learn
from the pine

thunderstorm
cattle dogs
at play

the movers’ estimate
you’ve got
practically nothing

windows open
the buoy’s
rusty bell

apologies
a distant train

overnight rain
something
i’m forgetting

cocktails served
with piquant gossip

windows open
a cacophony
of tree frogs

where her body was found
lilacs

walk-off win
forgetting why
we were arguing

walk-off win
forgetting what
the fight was about

right on schedule
the old-timer’s
bag of cans

waiting for the light to change
an old man’s
shopping cart

finally spring
the gray-haired parents
of a toddler

waiting for the train
a woman’s pregnant belly

hope city
a distant mirage

cherry blossom festival
all the blooming idiots
in washington

bring on the night
a pay phone ringing
in an empty parking lot

feeling old
i ask for
the young mezcal

lingering
the memory
of an old girlfriend

restless night
the fishing boats
that don’t come home

temperature dip
hold the chips

pink moon
my granddaughter’s
blue eyes

twilight
a stranger tells me
i have my grandfather’s hands

persistent drizzle
even in old photographs
i look old

cold rain
granpa’s been
drinking again

war isn’t a game
but how can you argue
with that body?

cold rain
unfriended

the weekend forecast
two to three
six-packs

april fog
i tossed and turned
all night

420
time to look up
that brownie recipe

the face in the mirror
even wearier
than it appears

fair weather clouds
my white hair

church picnic
a curve ball
at the knees

maybe a raindrop
the fragrance
of morning

writer’s block
someone rearranged
my poetry magnets

over morning coffee
two does
by the side of the road

wind advisory
afraid of what
i’ll wish for next

wind advisory
neither of us
answers the phone

caption
convicted killer
fussing with hair

a long way from home
the puzzled look
when i order a hero

the candidate’s speech
swinging at a pitch
in the dirt

frost warning
i pluck
a gray eyebrow hair

windy city
wherever
i am

chilly night
but she has to show off
her new tattoo

adjusting my posture
as i walk past
the mannequins

duende
trying to explain it
to my dog

second-hand smoke
the president says
mistakes were made

happy hour
the carpenter orders
a rusty nail

spring snow
the slugger’s
prolonged slump

that moment
i realized
i’d forgotten you

spring snow
i’ve forgotten her

town dump
local politicians
with clipboards

writer’s block
the dog pees
on the last snow pile

sleepless night
the songbirds
right on time

for my sins
everything i wanted
within reach

lowriders
their heads
held high

sleeping beside me
an empty tequila bottle

freshly cut grass
remembering
my first ballgame

the future
isn’t what it used to be
scrambled eggs

his old room
the jigsaw puzzle
unfinished

undecided
a candidate
i can trust

deeply rooted
her platinum blonde hair

over strong cocktails
whispering
about mom

howling at the moon
the dog’s
puzzled expression

with a wink
she apologizes
for having only one bed

ripening
in the sunshine
a squirrel carcass

the dark mountains
we were warned
never to come here

gripping my fingers
the thorns
of a perfect rose

cactus flower
the farmer’s daughter
smiles at me

empty glass
the first line
of my autobiography

to the sand
am i more than
another pair of feet?

writing on the beach
the lengthening shadow
of a lifeguard stand

a flock of blackbirds
riot police
take up positions

rip tide
a dog
chasing seagulls

morning sunshine
hair of the dog
that bit me

getting physical
the doctor tells me
to cough

drift apart
while no one
is watching

writer’s block
the sun
in my eyes

holding the door open
for a ladybug

under hypnosis
she says i don’t remember
a white picket fence

enlightenment
a city
on fire

out of gas
another co-worker
buries his son

curveball
she whispers
i love you

throwback thursday
forgetting the name
of that song

sirens
i forget
what day it is

empty stadium
the slugger still argues
balls and strikes

camden yards
signing autographs
for ghosts

proudly displayed
her crayon portrait
of grandpa

on the back
of a beer coaster
my next haiku

on the early train
a cascade
of stifled yawns

rush hour
i forget
another haiku

peaceful protest
the dog
gets a bath

passing the reception desk
hoping
she wears that blouse again

may day!
the dog discovers
a hornet’s nest

mostly cloudy
the doctor
scratches her head

long week
this bitter ale
sweet

swing and a miss
the company’s
revenue numbers

empty nightclub
the jukebox plays
the thrill is gone

in a dream
an unfinished haiku

writer’s block
not a cloud
in the sky

fair-weather clouds
a heavy sigh

mild earthquake
the dog
in our bed

losing the breath
i was saving
for sunrise

desert sand
am i the only one
who hears its whispers?

fight of the century
a night
on the couch

switching meds
a hollowed-out skull
along the path

winding road
the thrill
of hugging her curves

fever dream
everything i told
the scorpion

dusk
answering my mother’s question
twice

fist full of quarters
unable to find
a pay phone

flower moon
presidential candidates
popping up like weeds

popping up like weeds
presidential candidates

milk moon
the softness
of her skin

noontime sun
the dog
smiles

moonlight
the shadow
of a container ship

rock ’n roll
two old men
on the beach

staring at me
from the storm drain
nightmare eyes

lazy morning
the sizzle
of chorizo

it’s not a dare
but how hot can i make
this quesadilla?

yelp review
the dog
discovers bees

the rookie’s debut
azaleas in bloom

dropping a glass
highlight
of the opening act

opening band
the crowd rivetted
to the game

morning traffic
how quickly
it slows down

windless night
wondering what the tree frogs
are trying to tell me

more blurred than i remembered
a photo of our late dog

twilight
explaining to my grandson
what a phone booth is

cambridge happy hour
the topic changes
to quantum mechanics

writer’s block
the desert landscape
of my dreams

restless sleep
the all-night laundromat
of my dreams

spin cycle
i turn off
the news

all-night laundromat
surrounded by
awake! magazines

morning meditation
everything
i haven’t got

huddled beneath
a hand-made quilt
the shelter dog

desert moon
the moment
we met

desert moon
embracing
the silence

weekend
the vanishing
horizon

vanishing horizon
it all
comes together

first day of school
empty backpacks
queued up at the curb

mother’s day
she forgets which son
she’s talking to

love at first sight
a flock of pigeons
and my sandwich

desert rose
an invitation
to the shadows

meanwhile
hard at work
a hummingbird

loneliness
the view
from last place

opening a beer
i quench
the silence

mom
as i remember her
in black-and-white

tagging a photo
of the one
who unfriended me

on social media
a mother lode
of tributes

mother’s day
explaining
what a milf is

mother’s day
the frantic search
for breath mints

veto-proof
the president’s
mom jeans

plastic flowers
i was being kind
when i called her quirky

offering advice
instead of money
the phone slams

forgetting
what i learned
from the azaleas

sunset
i finish my beer
too quickly

sailor’s daughter
fishing
for compliments

through the open door
someone else’s cat

mentioning her boyfriend
the paint peels

monday hangover
surrounded by
slamming doors

blind date
making note
of the exit signs

named for mom
the kiss
will never fade away

instant tail wag
when he sees me
the quarantined dog

clouds without rain
she doesn’t
recognize me

cloudless sky
a puppy chases
spring’s first butterfly

cloudburst
the street puddles
become one

cloudburst
the restless
arroyo

heavy sigh
a valley
bears my name

also weeping
willow

still pond
a duck paddles
through the moon

writer’s block
the dog
lies down

dandelions
tv news
without sound

class reunion
another harrowing tale
of sobriety

broken clouds
the promise
of rain

wedding anniversary
no longer feeling
the ring

sporting only a smile
she turns off
the sports channel

crescent moon
she asks
my age

pale sky
the thrill is gone

full of words
the pen
runs dry

with strong cocktails
we toast
our death sentence

on death row
the puppy
who stopped being cute

marathon coverage
of the marathon trial
of the marathon bomber

on the campaign trail
a ripe quince falls
between two squirrels

carved into
this desk
my nature haiku

even the cheap wine
exquisite
on your lips

overcast
a dark spot
on my mri

dropping her ice cream
a beauty queen’s
temper tantrum

perfect day
to shop
for a surgeon

freshly washed car
bathed in pollen

pleasant dreams
starlight
over the bay

moonless night
twisting too quickly
i see stars

like a breakup
the chiropractor’s
apology

the old wharf
how many tired feet
have trampled you?

getaway day
another game
that got away

after rough play
the dogs share
a patch of sun

uncomposed
a letter
to my sons

new moon
a phone call
from unknown number

new moon
i ask
about pain meds

sunrise
a deep breath
before tying my shoes

another candidate
i don’t recall giving
our country

false spring
the former all-star
clears waivers

mostly cloudy
so many cures for pain
in my junk folder

crowded cafe
everyone i don’t remember
from the neighborhood

thinking globally
her buoyant breasts

sliver moon
i squint
to see it

mourning doves
they make me smile

that zen moment
before the boot
comes crashing down

writer’s block
my favorite pub
closes down

pale sky
words
fail me

false spring
designated
for assignment

catching my eye
her fishnet stockings

drinking alone
a stray dog’s
wagging tail

writer’s block
striking out
with the bases loaded

happy to be home
i spare an inch worm’s life
for good measure

sunset
spraypainting
the sky

filibuster
a boulder
rolls uphill

cloudless sky
the many colors
of dusk

patriot act
hiding
behind the flag

abandoned playground
the shadows
play

my half-smile
when she calls my apartment
quaint

aged but mellow
the tequila
and me

lonely highway
i may or may not
be lost

holiday weekend
shopping
for a surgeon

finally the weekend
lilacs

lilacs
finally
the weekend

late-night radio
telling the grandkids
about wolfman jack

the air quotes he uses
when he calls me
a poet

memorial day
will we ever learn
from past mistakes?

memorial day
will we
never learn?

the old dog
finding her place
in the sun

where does the time go?
her hourglass figure

hiding
in plain sight
cardinal

dusk
more years behind me
than before me

dusk
too weary
to kill a fly

dreaming i could fly
maple seeds
in the air

half moon
another cup
of coffee

family court
discovering
what discovery means

overcast
turning away
from a wounded soldier

asleep
on a park bench
the unknown soldier

news from washington
giving the compost
a stir

the old dog
finding a place
in the sun

the tick doesn’t care
that i’m not
the outdoor type

missing the last train
the ghosts
who mock me

quasi-legal
replied the lawyer
unblinking

squirrel!
obedience class
is over

spring breeze
the falling dow

wall street sell-off
the dog yawns

the voices in your head
are more real
than they appear

revolting
the rich kid’s
che guevara t-shirt

broken clouds
a letter
from my daughter

rain delay
the swirling puddle
of my dreams

after the rain
not a dry eye
in the village

in fairness
i should mention
that life isn’t fair

in the men’s room
an uncomfortably long discussion
about coffee

fireworks
a quavering dog
beneath the bed

losing streak
the diesel fumes
sting

warming trend
the dog’s breath
against my leg

warming trend
the dog’s breath

warming trend
her legs
grow longer

overcast
a cloud
of gnats

all my demons
so shabbily dressed

thunderclouds without rain
another presidential candidate

empty promises
storm clouds
without rain

cool rain
looks straight ahead
not at me

major league debut
a dog
who’s seen it all

lilac blossoms
the dog rolls
in something nasty

weakening me
in the knees
her bare shoulders

gibbous moon
her falling
shoulder strap

quagmire
how a bill
doesn’t become law

refriended
the weekend
begins early

patriot act
the big brother
i didn’t want

all ears
explaining a curveball
to the puppy

over morning coffee
a tropical storm
quietly brews

desert highway
fresh flowers
at the shrine

also waiting
for the rain
wilted peonies

lights out
the shelter dog’s
sad eyes

splash!
the puppy pounces
on his reflection

losing myself
inside her

fever dream
her eyes
say yes

between showers
an uncomfortable silence

in my dreams
the coney island
i never knew

slow soaking rain
my sad and weary bones

slow soaking rain
one meeting
after another

slow soaking rain
a cold
cup of coffee

writer’s block
slow soaking rain

hiding
behind the bushes
rabbit moon

after the rain
her blouse clinging
in all the right places

after the rain
i miss my exit
and don’t care

after the rain
stripping off
her wet clothes

almost there
her pained expression
of absolute pleasure

after the rain
what to do
with the home team

after the rain
the dog’s vigil
beside a lonely window

the dog’s vigil
a lonely window

tired window
the elusive word

gridlock
the race
to nowhere

strawberry moon
the girl next door
in love

strawberry moon
her nipples
in the breeze

away on business
the dog sleeps
on her side

popping the cork
she goes down
on me

strawberry moon
finding
the spot

leaving the station
right on time
an empty train

late spring chill
the closer’s
ninth inning meltdown

bitter coffee
a storm brewing
in the distance

amazing grace
the tai-chi master’s
silent bow

dry weekend
storm clouds
on the horizon

under my son’s bed
empty candy wrapppers
and a bra

taped to
an empty refrigerator
his daily affirmations

clenching my fist
the needle
and the damage done

delicious
the way she eats
a strawberry

sweetness
i’m
your candy man

storm clouds
an empty raft
washes ashore

in slow motion
the stitches
on a knuckle ball

daylight fades
my mother asks
the same question twice

reaping what i sow
the farmer’s daughter
with a badge

faux victorian
repeating patterns
in the manufactured wood

late-inning rally
i’m ready
to go again

late-inning rally
she winks back

late-inning rally
wondering where
the weekend went

red-light district
a stray dog
drinks from a puddle

storm surge
her sturdy hips

off-day
no wonder i feel
a little off

blackout drunk
i misplace
my glasses

feeling rebellious
i change lanes
without signalling

awakened
from my tropical daydream
a mango falls

tropical depression
too many days
to my next vacation

blind date
reaching for
the same wine glass

threat of thunderstorms
looking up a recipe
for jambalaya

page not found
i’m not
where i think i am

severe thunderstorm warning
a murder
of crows

strong tropical cocktails
the mermaid
across the bar

eye of the storm
she sees me staring
at her legs

eye of the storm
she takes off
her sundress

still pond
a dragonfly
lands on the moon

half moon
decidedly
undecided

half moon
a scoreless tie

after the storm
to be as relaxed
as my dog

stumbling in the dark
i pocket-dial
a dead friend

was it something i said
hummingbird?

fire drill
one more day
without getting fired

gripping the bed posts
she’s finally ready

after the conference
pigeons
feasting on crumbs

stardust
what wishes
are made of

bobbing among the reeds
an empty styrofoam cup

waiting room
the beautiful people
on magazine covers

writer’s block
a white box
labeled sterile

alone in the exam room
an empty tissue box
and me

alone
in the exam room
an empty tissue box

where the nursing home used to be
an old man selling flowers

ferry landing
hello
meets goodbye

hugging her
oh so close
that dress

paying my taxes
dandelion seeds
in the air

beachcombing
i turn a horseshoe crab
upright

in the old oak tree
an abandoned
bird nest

accumulating snow
my hair no longer
salt and pepper

lovebirds
always believing
they’re invisible

considering my options
the dog dreams

in a quiet garden
the buddha gazes
beyond me

beach bar regular
a one-eyed dog

imagining it
finally free
her pony-tailed hair

zen garden
an old man
spitting sunflower shells

golden smog
my empty pockets

that moment
when everything else
disappeared

flag day
a homeless man sleeps
in front of the state house

waning moon
the rookie’s fastball
fizzles

waning moon
the rookie’s fastball
fizzles out

gypsy violin
an old man’s tears

starless night
i can’t believe
the weekend is over

covered in dust
his room
full of blue ribbons

writer’s block
his trophy room
undisturbed

the announcement
behind the bushes
a stray dog squats

music to my ears
that sound she doesn’t know
she’s making

something we didn’t plant
a rabbit’s nest
in the garden

new moon
a rabbit’s nest
in the garden

after the rain
a puddle filled
with stars

change the channel!
the reality show star
runs for president

tonight’s forecast
an extra helping
of rice and beans

school’s out
the children crossing sign
riddled with bullets

a late-night gust
blowing away
my dream

sliver moon
when is a wink
just a wink?

sliver moon
a secret revealed

sliver moon
the dog’s
drooping eyelids

sliver moon
her oh-so-tight
fuck-me dress

abandoned school
a soft breeze ripples
through the weeds

today on facebook
a reminder for an event
i don’t plan to attend

sound asleep beside me
my little rabbit killer

what songs might they sing?
the dents
in the old man’s trumpet

thinking
that the poems i’ve forgotten
were probably my best

imagining
all of
victoria’s secrets

at last she surrenders
la petite mort

aftershocks
a rift
between brothers

overcast
the doctor shows a resident
my mri

suburban terrorist
a blue jay
at the finch feeder

solstice
one foot longer
than the other

life flashing before my eyes
my grandson shoots me
with his finger

moonrise
unhooking
her bra

celebrating
celebration sex

a right-wing conspiracy
when only drumsticks
are left

chipmunk
always too busy
for morning meditation

a deep breath
what i learned
from the water lilies

so cozy on my lap
this stainless steel dobro

under new management
the same
old cobwebs

i believe in ghosts
the goth girl’s
shredded blouse

five children
one father’s day card
my cup runneth empty

father’s day
a roadside memorial
of beer cans

solstice
it’s all downhill
from here

broken clouds
a half-hearted
sun salutation

broken clouds
the ones
who didn’t call

always crashing the party
cormorant

solstice
her alabaster orbs

solstice
my uneven
sideburns

dusk
i write the same poem
twice

longest day
finally
out of words

his sword unsheathed
she whispers
take me

a robot voice
offers to refinance
the house i don’t own

cloudless sky
a tattoo removal special

white gardenias
she doesn’t know i’ve seen
her facebook page

turning a corner
a puppy runs
into the road

santa fe plaza
a sea
of turquoise

wave after wave
mezcal dreams

first firefly
the campus visit
of my dreams

shooting a bottle rocket
the neighbor’s red glare

writer’s block
storm chasers spot
a wall cloud

writer’s block
a wall cloud

broken clouds
unbuttoning
her blouse

yellow sky
the one
that got away

after the rain
everybody’s heading
for the watusi rodeo

waiting room
the dead plant’s posture
a lot like mine

skyscraper
the spectacular
silence

all-night diner
the cook
props up the drunk

cuing up that dream
where the tires
just miss the cat

eggs over easy
today’s
market picks

its empty stare
a plastic model
of the perfect spine

beneath silk sheets
we find
our rhythm

dreaming of my first love
the kiss
that never happened

thrift store
more than a few
regrets

summer rain
my granddaughter’s
laugh

waxing moon
her see-through
nightgown

writer’s block
the clouds
all cloud-shaped

writer’s block
shapeless clouds

the court rules
a butterfly freed
from the spider web

writer’s block
sometimes a fuck
is just a fuck

going rogue
a bull
on main street

gibbous moon
he promises to quit
if she spends the night

finally it clicks
the acupuncturist’s
stiletto heels

overcast
the dog sighs

down to business
her unbuttoned blouse

embracing
the sunset
my shadow

high noon
the dog’s nose
twitching in the sun

chinatown station
an old woman
offers me her seat

lost in chinatown
all roads
leading east

summer rain
a big red umbrella
with legs

manufactured
from recycled material
the candidate’s speech

in the exam room
a rubber glove
escaping the box

running out of road
a jacknifed trailer
on the overpass

hamstring cramp
a dramatic fall
on wall street

deadheading the daffodils
a wall street sell-off

tightening my abs
the trainer tells me
not to hold my breath

work-life balance
the intern’s
tight skirt

work-life balance
the intern’s
stiletto heels

not a bad life
napping in the sun
between tummy rubs

unlike his divorces
he takes his vodka
neat

always dressed
for the occasion
ladybug

rise and shine!
puppies picking up
where they left off

waiting for your call
i lose another game
of solitaire

gibbous moon
my wine glass
nearly empty

nervously tapping
the empty bar
a pickpocket’s slender fingers

still waiting
gibbous moon

where to start?
chrysanthemums

buck moon
a closely watched pot
of boiling water

buck moon
i suck in my gut
as she walks on by

buck moon
i suck in
my gut

i think about it
a quiz to make sure
i’m not dead

buck moon
i circulate
the petition

cloudless sky
i turn off
my phone

independence day
a dog
chained to a fence

independence day
she asks me
to get comfortable

independence day
tearing off
each other’s clothes

lining
the parade route
gladiolas

summer morning
the haze
of too much beer

always missing the train
the hat i left behind

the planets align
signifying what?

fireworks
the dog
chases a squirrel

summer fog
a stranger whispers
alzheimer’s

fireworks
that twinkle
in her eye

in the waiting room
plastic carnations
covered with dust

new day
a freshly spun
spider web

restless night
the songbird’s
sorry tune

a dying oak
the poems i write
when i’m drunk

trying to remember my dream
i cut myself shaving

monday morning traffic
a slug
crosses the patio

gibbous moon
her half-smile

cloudy skies
i clear
my calendar

baja daydream
tonight’s weather
hot and steamy

danger ahead
the weather anchor’s
plunging neckline

too much wine
all of the puzzle pieces
look the same

air turbulence
the last
unsalted nut

muggy night
the tenderness
of your nipples

stepping on a stray pin
i remember her name

unable to move
we forgot to tell him
he wasn’t a lap dog

my aching back
a garden overgrown
with thorns

the market falls
the market rises
somewhere a distant ocean

the perfect prescription
cheerfully served
with rocks and salt

same time as yesterday
the untrimmed thorn bush

summer haze
wishing i had said yes
to pain meds

summer haze
wishing i had
said yes

the rooster crows
wall street
lays an egg

ominous clouds
a misplaced rake
in my zen garden

her smile
when i can’t remember
her name

summer vacation
school buses behind
a padlocked fence

summer rerun
my smelly
old sandals

who loves the sun?
an old dog
fast asleep

lazy day
lingering
on her curves

after the rain
a lingering mist
of mosquitoes

ruining
the perfect spider web
monarch butterfly

broken clouds
taking down the flag
for the last time

hazy sunrise
her first
walk of shame

unable to sleep
the distant
turnpike din

sympathy letter
she misspells
condolences

imagining
the beautiful stranger
i’ll never meet

yes i know
you can’t stay
daylily

crescent moon
the perfect spot
for that nightgown

quiet street
the feeling
i’m being watched

homeless man
telling his dog
not to beg

cluttered shed
i bump my head
on wind chimes

cluttered shed
the sound of wind chimes
when i bump my head

warm day ahead
her see-through
sun dress

warm day ahead
her backlit
sun dress

before dawn
a birthday reminder
for a late friend

waking up hungry
the mosquitoes
make me breakfast

waning moon
her string bikini

waning moon
a fugitive
on the run

waning moon
my mother forgets
why she called

caught looking
her low-cut
baseball jersey

my little mermaid
asks grandpa
to wipe her nose

only a dream
the lingering scent
of jasmine

only a dream
scent of jasmine

boarding the elevator
some really bad cologne

the silence
when the therapist asks
what i’m thinking

amber sky
the last
of the beer

tonight’s sunset
the color
of forgetting

riding the elevator
cheap perfume

cheap perfume
riding the elevator

24-hour news
the rest
is silence

through
the morning haze
locusts

baja daydream
a mango falls

baja midnight
the hidden moon

scrawled in
red spray paint
peace now!

broken streetlights
i find myself
in a dark place

crowded vet clinic
an elderly couple leaves
with an empty cat carrier

ominous clouds
a second opinion
matches the first

fresh coffee
a break
in the weather

loneliness
a bottle of wine
without a corkscrew

morning sun
hearing a familiar song
for the first time

morning glory
hearing a familiar song
for the first time

flea market
for no reason at all
a box of knobs

hoping it’s a dream
when i realize
no one’s driving this bus

dive bar
another sunset
ignored

dive bar
my eyes dive into
her cleavage

after the rain
searching for
the silver lining

winning at solitaire
an empty bottle
of champagne

hold me tight
or i will
lose my grip

dead end
what might
have been

lonely street
i find
myself

balmy night
the dog’s breath
against my leg

summer rain
the river swells
unattended

writer’s block
the air thick
with locusts

blazing sunshine
the slugger stares
at strike three

my best haiku
the one i forgot
to write down

over fish and chips
describing the one
that got away

my favorite fragrance
the sea breeze
in your hair

restless sleep
footprints
on the moon

hot and steamy
that look

savoring
the tenderness
beneath
those spaghetti straps

sweltering heat
a misplayed ball
in left field

the hunger beyond
her spaghetti straps

sun salutation
i curse
the alarm clock

swept on the road
to sarcastic applause

all-night diner
the rookie tips
his pitches

gravity’s pull
my untied shoelace

shimmering heat
my daydreams
dressed as mermaids

market correction
my rising
blood pressure

his gently arched back
the beachcomber

crescent moon
your well-meaning
afterthought

the dance we dance
chasing the mosquito

summer twilight
a fawn
crossing the highway

hollywood movie
reaching for popcorn
i see stars

in my spam folder
a cure
for stuttering

unraveling
his comb-over
a burst of hot air

sunny afternoon
stepping over
the old dog

encircling
the rusty swing set
bittersweet

cloudy
with a chance
of crows

deep summer
where the weeping willow
used to be

game time
finding a baseball
in my winter boots

last game
of the road trip
a swarm of flies

sweet dreams
an old dog
and his new best friend

unstable air
someone mentions
my exwife’s name

snake in the grass
his presidential credentials

summer breeze
her shy smile

winning at solitaire
the lone and level sands
stretch far away

rip tide
lost
for words

eyes at half-mast
the junkie says
he wants to die

turning off
the alarm on my phone
i swipe left

lost in paradise
i find
myself

betrayal
his hero
wearing pinstripes

pitcher’s duel
so many
tantalizing curves

darkening sky
i order
a stout

still surprised not to see
an awkward adolescent
in the mirror

monday morning hangover
even
the mockingbird knows

telling me
she’s close
that faraway look

baja back road
hoping
i’m lost

smooth skin
the perfect plum

darkening sky
a workplace argument
about religion

bear in the china shop
a big mess on wall street

temperature rising
her sundress falls
to the floor

waxing gibbous moon
does she know
i can see her undressing?

waxing gibbous moon
something rustling
in the woods

my status update
windless
with morning clouds

hot night
unwilling to surrender
to sleep

blue moon
she’s
in the mood

ready for sleep
and then
your kiss

blue moon
i finish
what i started

blue moon
finishing what
i started

a kiss
simply because
you’re near me

a kiss
simply because

lemon shandy
the rive gauche cafe
of my dreams

la petite mort
the beautiful
agony

la petite mort
her beautiful
agony

blue moon
my angel’s
wicked smile

slow dance
she says yes
to someone else

continued heat
the weather man’s
overcooked metaphors

summer rain
the dog
chases his tail

summer rain
the steaming
asphalt

between t stops
the screaming shadows

hugging her curves
a lingering bead
of sweat

blue moon
she announces
her elopement

my favorite perfume
the ocean breeze
in her hair

sturgeon moon
an abandoned pier
battered by waves

thinking about her
an abandoned pier
battered by waves

wave after wave
her undulating hips

wave after wave
her unrelenting
curves

tell me i’m the only one
who loved you
like the moon

always right on time
the morning after

sudden gust
a 6-run lead
blows away

bright red tomatoes
a double entendre
gone wrong

august
the hissing
weeds

august
the top
of the mountain

that special place
where sighs
become moans

cute as a button
my unbuttoned bride

wind chimes
the beautiful music
we make together

summer twilight
i just want this pain
to be over

rusty train tracks
the promises
we make

crickets
the long way home

lost weekend
the train
that wasn’t there

with a firm handshake
the words
keep in touch

city playground
a butterfly crosses
the police line

sharing my umbrella
an unexpected
gust of wind

sharing my umbrella
the wind

gnawing
at my complacency
a starving dog

how long
i’ve waited for you
firefly

a little too close
the thunder
of nesting geese

distant thunder
remembering the last time
we kissed

dead end
a neglected
cemetery

after the storm
the chill
of fire sirens

presidential debate
a dog barking
at squirrels

high and tight
her low-cut
baseball jersey

high and tight
a natural
in a baseball jersey

scalding
the tea party candidate’s
rhetoric

break in the heat
basking
in the afterglow

phone call to my son
i  savor
the sweet wine

writer’s block
she asks me to write
a love poem

tonight’s debate
a clown
among elephants

airport security
my granddaughter
plays peek-a-boo

gop debate
shrink the government
by being the government

mostly cloudy
ten privileged men
crowd the stage

unicorns and rainbows
ten privileged men
gushing about god

finally friday
a stray dog’s
wagging tail

fair-weather clouds
knowing it’s all
been said before

getting down to business
her business suit
comes off

now on tap
a cool
blues riff

contemplating my legacy
i tear up
a lottery ticket

undisputed king
of the fallow garden
tiger lily

also gone
too soon
meteor shower

waning moon
answering my mother’s question
twice

end of the weekend
another shooting star

three beers later
all of the songs
are my song

dancing
with the ceiling fan
cobwebs

dancing with the stars
the town drunk

cobwebs dancing
with the ceiling fan

i don’t get her
but i want her
steampunk girl

shooting star
a wall street rally

twilight
your shadow
and mine

preparing for takeoff
her soft cotton
nightgown

my favorite bathrobe
the one
she’s wearing

out of tune
the broken jukebox

california breakfast
the obligatory
man-bun

summer drought
with no sign
of relief pitching

asked what i want
i reply
more

top down
her dream
convertible

right on time
jet lag

pacific coast highway
cell phone towers
disguised as palm trees

meteor shower
dancing
with the stars

morro bay
pelicans
in formation

meteor shower
my thought
exactly

meteor shower
i forget
what i was thinking

just desserts
spooning
with my lover

hummingbird
the ever-present
buddha

also missing
the meteor shower
hummingbird

beauty so breathtaking
i could tweet about it
all day

ready to face
another day
a hard-boiled egg

totally spent
i treasure
the moment

touring the brewery
spent grain
in a smoldering vessel

wine tasting
the dark overtones
in our conversation

only the best charcuterie
a dog named princess

hot summer night
the tickle of her hair
against my neck

running for cover
i tell her that grandpa
isn’t ticklish

vultures overhead
the argument
against peace

all dolled up
for the boardwalk
pink ribbon
in her silver hair

communing with nature
another cigarette
on the balcony

another year
of words
i meant to say

tequila hangover
the blue agave blues

fish market
an island
of bellowing seals

shooting star
carmen mcrae
sings bye bye blackbird

are we there yet?
another trip
around the sun

not a care
in the world
sea otters

with my eye
on the deadline
sea otters

the long goodbye
a vapor trail
in the sky

paper tiger
his 5-page
resume

now boarding
my next bout
of jet lag

redondo beach
a bmw
in the bike lane

3-hour layover
all the flights
that aren’t mine

airport dining
only the finest
plastic china

customer service
the empty spaces
behind the counter

waiting to board
the headlines
between the hairspray

fair-weather clouds
her tepid praise

fair-weather clouds
the new boss
remembers my name

first day of chemo
the conversation
turns to baseball

not in the cards
a tarot reading

defying gravity
her strapless gown

someone i touched
the surging tide

asked about morphine
i declare my allegiance
to honey white

strong medicine
the apple
so far from the tree

gusty winds
where the old oak
used to be

bending in the wind
the old oak
and me

crescent moon
unhooking
her bra

no intention
to sleep
those bedroom eyes

reflected
in a dog’s eye
everything

the moon’s reflection
what the glacier
left behind

even they fade
plastic roses

where he once
dreamed all day
a desert rose

mother’s little helper
the dog
licks his lips

no break in the heat
not that i’m complaining

waiting for me
a wet kiss
from the dog

beale street
yankee tourists
whistling dixie

tossing the bouquet
the high school
strikeout queen

dog days of summer
a wall street meltdown

missing the train
another loser
at lucky’s lounge

out the window
the fund manager’s
lucky charm

late night
the junkyard dog
wags his tail

crescent moon
just a fraction
of myself

neither here nor there
every place
i’d rather be

back to work
a dull pain
between the temples

dinner guests
i lose
at solitaire

summer cold
a leaky kettle
on the stove

town dump
signing a petition
i know nothing about

hot summer night
melting
into you

baby’s breath
the things i remember
before i died

sea of tranquility
is it only
a dream?

summer’s gone
flu shots
now available

church parking lot
the sign reads
not a drive-thru

driven to the edge
exactly where
i want to be

light drizzle
a lingering
summer cold

that twinkle
in the bartender’s eye
when i say the best

wall street tumbles
a sea turtle’s march
to the ocean

first step
what i learned
from the daylily

the view from wall street
soap bubbles
in the wind

restless night
the cadence
of a sanitation truck

the candidate’s speech
a passing
garbage truck

retirement dreams
a tsunami
on the horizon

the market rallies
still
a lingering cough

the rally fizzles
it happens
she says

another storm brewing
wondering when
to wonder when

morning coffee
another storm
brewing

eyes on my pension
a pelican
plunges

retired stock broker
searching
for sand dollars

tumbleweed
the place
i call home

gibbous moon
birthday wishes
for a dead friend

moonrise
forgetting what
the fight was about

national dog day
paw prints
on my pillow

cold war
a blonde bombshell
in a bikini

blonde bombshell
in a bikini

perseid
another shooting
star

expensive champagne
unable to taste
the difference

red dragonfly
wondering
what it all means

gibbous moon
as if
i wasn’t there

dusk
words
fail me

extra credit
she leaves the teacher an apple
and a wink

late august
the brown edges
of my haiku notebook

summer
painting shadows
on the dog

summer gridlock
turtles crossing
the road

sturgeon moon
how the cobblestones
shine

the twinkle in her eye
when i ask
about her tattoo

red moon
she tries on
that dress

super moon
objects in the mirror
are smaller than they appear

last days of august
the lingering heat
of a habanero

last days of august
the lingering heat
in her eyes

her sunday best
because all the good girls
are in church

back to school
how little
i’ve learned

back to school
mothers at the bus stop
comparing tattoos

airport lounge
businessmen compare
travel delays

ragweed
the new boss
mispronounces my name

late summer
ragweed
in the wind

downtown gridlock
a drunk conducts the orchestra
in his mind

howling at dogs
a junkie
in the rain

finally
you know what they say
about a fool and his money

dusty cobblestones
a tourist bus
idling at the curb

bad call
questioning
the umpire’s lineage

september swoon
bear droppings
on wall street

mezcal daydream
the smoke
in her eyes

last train gone
only the pigeons wait

september call-ups
shadows lengthen
on yawkey way

nuclear standoff
the first acorn falls

landsdowne street
one world’s best sausage
after another

september swoon
surrendering
to yes

cloudless dusk
the friend of a friend
unfriends me

september
two marriages, one divorce
and a bottle of wine

last call
the bartender’s
shiny navel

late-night traffic
a purring kitten

storm clouds
washing down the pain meds
with something nasty

overcast
the dog stretches
then lies back down

floating
in the wine
my unfinished poem

pale sky
the paper boy’s
rusty bike chain

in muted light
the angel’s song

late for the train
the busker
takes requests

cicadas
how much younger
i looked then

play ball!
hot dog vendors
in unison

two cocktails later
my crisp white dress shirt

wearing her sunday best
the pretty girl’s
ugly scowl

day moon
wishing
i had slept longer

labor day
another retirement dream

restless night
a delivery truck’s
slamming doors

wondering
if those billy clubs
are union-made

a barking dog
chasing you
from my dream

floating in a martini glass
the fly who loved me

watching my step
i tell myself
it’s benign clutter

disappearing in a sneeze
my haiku moment

reading my diary
the starless night

an empty page
that poem
about her

lost in thought
the awkward adolescent
in the mirror

to think i wanted this
a corridor
between windowless rooms

outside the er
the surgeon
bums a cigarette

shotgun shack
a broken banjo
full of magnolias

waiting room
a selection of magazines
i never read

exam room
a cold draft
in the back
of my hospital gown

heat wave
one bead of sweat
joins another

today’s news
steep declines
in the energy sector

heat wave
the nurse’s
cold stethoscope

the air quotes i use
when i call him
doctor

9 11
remembering
where i wasn’t

the ultimate promise
one i’ll never make

summer rain
a song i can’t
get out of my head

discarded roses
just for you

summer fog
a lingering
head cold

after the rain
her deep blue eyes

summer overcast
the dog pees
on buddha

wearing only a towel
the perfect beach

late for the ark
unicorn

new moon
the same
empty promises

new moon
everything
i can’t see

summer rain
the moment i discover
she’s not wearing a bra

summer’s over
the beach
all to ourselves

wave upon wave
my tropical dreams

wave after wave
her intoxicating lips

new moon
updating
my medication list

alone on the l train
an empty beer can rolls
to the front of the car

independence day
a bull sleeping
on the highway

pondering my future
a shopping cart
with a broken wheel

pay day
a squirrel stashing walnuts
behind the shed

police lights
a twinkle
in my grandson’s eye

before i can
find the words
sunset

sunset
before i can find
the words

last call
the drunk
at the end of the bar
is me

climate change
the supermodel
in a peasant dress

moonless night
why i drink alone

moving day
the letter
i never sent

willfully captured
by her fishnet stockings

tonight’s debate
whether or not
to finish the wine

sliver moon
i pour
the rest of the wine

at camera one
the call for war

cheap whiskey
feeding
my ulcer

roots revival
she grows out
her gray hair

keeping out
the migrants
sons of migrants

writer’s block
the light bulb
i keep changing

bright sunshine
the junkie
mocks the drunk

upscale pub
everybody’s waiting
for someone else

two beers into
the best i’ve felt
all day

before daylight
i imagine
the executioner’s song

before daylight
the executioner’s song

september
a dugout filled
with spotless uniforms

the smile i smile
when she tells me
she’s praying for me

exam room
the thoughtful gesture
of the plastic skeleton

write about me!
the dog’s
wagging tail

crescent moon
imagining i’m the only one
who can see it

crescent moon
as if i’m the only one
who can see it

spring snow
surrounded by grandchildren
i cry uncle!

cool autumn morning
we won’t tell him
he’s not a lap dog

reading the stock futures
a dead skunk in the road

cool autumn morning
feeling the absence
of my wedding band

cool autumn morning
the draft in the back
of my hospital gown

moonrise
learning
to walk again

half past midnight
feeling
the incision

frost warning
the catheter’s sting

a pretty nurse
the catheter’s sting

shift change
rumors
of a beautiful day

midnight
the shiny
hospital floor

first day of fall
trying out
the walker

the look on my face
when i see

oxycodone dreams
clearly these belong
to someone else

gibbous moon
a junkie
on the nod

coney island
the loudspeaker plays
sunglasses after dark

coney island dreams
the loudspeaker plays
sunglasses after dark

startled from sleep
a drone hovers
above

late september
comparing
magic numbers

fireflies ascending
into jazz

fall begins
taking inventory
of my sweatshirts

oxycontin
the leaves
turn

slow news day
the pope
takes manhattan

september
an invasion of unconscionable
pumpkin beverages

papal security
clearing the shadows
from the subway

september baseball
i throw
a fit

september baseball
the star pitcher
throws a tantrum

a stranger tells me
he’s familiar
with my mri

who’s forgotten first?
me
or the red dragonfly?

the phone dials out
wondering what buttons
i’ve pushed

utterly ridiculous
said the cow

super moon
remembering
how small i am

writer’s block
and a choice
of laxatives

writer’s block
and then
this sunset

harvest moon
finding
the words

lunar eclipse
my unshaved face

ordering absinthe
the ubiquitous
hipster mustache

last week of baseball
setting up
the kindling pile

dropping
the chopsticks to the floor
mid-sentence

refilling my prescription
hummingbirds
at twilight

equinox
i walk into
a live film set

fall
celebrating
silence

small town parade
police on segways
chase a circus clown

morning fog
the coffee taste
in my tea

on the nod
a dog
in the sun

my favorite fragrance
a crisp autumn day

until next time
reads my horoscope

between downpours
an unapologetic
third cup of coffee

remembering
my next dose
a break in the clouds

end of september
the wind shifts
from baseball to football

the old man smiles
ripples
in the rain puddle

adjusting my pace
moss
on the neighbor’s roof

adjusting my pace
a neglected
backyard gazebo

water on mars
but i asked
for a beer

partly sunny
the salesman insists
this is not a sales call

ignoring the stop sign
the day trader’s
shiny new car

cleansing breath
counting the lies
in my dream journal

the lapses
in my dream
clutching black flowers

out of words
october rain

october
the fear
of winter jackets

cold front
washing down my meds
with microwaved coffee

lying down for a nap
the landscapers’ lullaby

october rain
my unshaved face

wanted a health supplement
without the word virtue

a pothole
turned puddle
still a pothole

considering my response
when her mother says
i have a vexatious spirit

changing my dressing
the scar
stares back at me

between showers
an unfamiliar silence

chilly night
the stray dog
a little closer

no speed limit
forgetting how long
she’s been gone

snake in the kitchen
the feeling
that i don’t belong

last game of the season
savoring every
sunflower seed

end of the season
what to do
with the leftover beer?

killing time
i finish
this haiku

beneath my scar
the rolling dunes
of an imaginary desert

used as a bookmark
a ticket stub for a trip
i don’t remember

my hero
photobombing
a selfie

the secret of youth
my mother forgets
her age

posing
in the drug store window
a future pin-up girl

october
missing the shade
of the old oak tree

season over
i follow
the acorn’s journey

misunderstood
a pumpkin
among weeds

catching my breath
a stack of firewood
in the shade

over loud punk rock
a selection
of herbal teas

autumn color
how she blushes
when i kiss her

streetlight after streetlight
the shadows
overtake me

vanishing point
where it all
comes together

over morning coffee
the news
from everywhere else

slightly light-headed
i balance
my portfolio

checks cashed day or night
where the flower shop
used to be

processing my feelings
when i’m not the only one
at the beach

like it’s always been there
a fallen branch

writer’s block
the sign reads
no outlet

mispronouncing my name
to tell me i won a prize
i never wanted

always too soon
october dusk

daylight
an infinity
between breaths

cutting down on coffee
i push the door
labeled pull

my walk with her
not as warm
as i’d hoped

waking from a nightmare
the best i’ve felt all day

writer’s block
a steel and concrete frame
for sale

dusk
my second wind
flies away

more than any of these clowns
undecided
has earned my vote

undecided
earns my vote

welcoming the storm
a carpet
of fallen leaves

shingles need a trim?
the woodpecker
thinks so

dancing in the autumn breeze
a dangling
electrical wire

storm gust
the dance of a dangling
electrical wire

cause of death
the hair of the dog
that bit him

last call
the rest
is silence

holiday weekend
the grandkids take turns
playing the victim

last call
now cracks
a noble heart

killing frost
the dog’s
soft fur

killing frost
the moon’s
sharp sickle

hiding nothing
the beard
on my face

october warm-up
is she thinking
what i’m thinking?

in the dogwood tree
the squirrel’s
restless underbelly

and why not?
a boston terrier
in the passenger seat

a relaxing walk
but afterwards
this shopping list

october warm-up
a gap
in the privacy fence

feeling generous
let me help you
with that bra

outside the nursing home
mother and daughter argue
in another language

at the end
of a long walk
a discarded banana peel

reading his poetry
a vapor trail
in the sky

after the rain
a chorus
of tree frogs

columbus day
the red-headed girl’s
turquoise necklace

mergers and acquisitions
she freshens up
her lipstick

october rain
my son wants to be
a better father

up and down
the playground see-saw’s
gang graffiti

new moon
my granddaughter’s first
jack o’lantern

it’s not rain
she kept saying
just heavy mist

grabbing an extra blanket
i keep telling myself
it’s my favorite season

even in
the bare trees
her face

shades of fall
the intern’s
bright red hair

daybreak
a fresh glass of rum
for the shrine

new moon
and nothing left
to say

miracle drug
how quickly
it fades

her skin even softer
than her satin pajamas

gunshot
sparrows erupt
from the trees

entangled
you complete
my dream

october chill
a dead rabbit
on the front porch

brittle to the touch
fallen leaves
on my shoulders

my new laptop!
i quickly void
the warranty

morning chill
the buoy’s
rusty bell

bone-chilling cold
but do i pity
the mosquito?

daybreak
hugging her curves

sliver moon
the feral cat’s
footsteps

autumn walk
the funeral home’s
perfect lawn

off-season
the town beach
of our dreams

startled from sleep
a robot voice tells me
i may have already won

suburban life
how quickly we clean up
after the accident

auto inspection
a hand-made crucifix
on the wall

for sale
a mostly fixed
fixer-uppper

gracefully oblivious
blue heron

freeze watch
her icy stare

watching over the countryside
the towers
of a nuclear power plant

frost warning
a question of continuing
to dye one’s hair

emptying the pool
the day my daughter
nearly drowned

restless night
remembering
my stillborn sister

vanquishing the enemy
my grandson
on his tablet

saving
for a snowy day
busy chipmunks

passing the graveyard
an empty plastic bag

one more game of solitaire
and i’m ready
to face humanity

bracing wind
wondering
which lung collapsed

sunny afternoon
going my way
caterpillar?

no dogs allowed
the playground’s
dog statue

revolutionary
i shut off
the tv

killing frost
her drop-dead red
lipstick

killing frost
the conversation turns
to politics

election day
yes please
to more coffee

writer’s block
no more
fair-weather clouds

town ball field
exchanging foul lines
for yard lines

last of the oxycontin
how slowly
the leaves fall

my high school yearbook
the rich girl’s
peasant blouse

whose childhood photo
is the bookmark
for grandma’s bible?

mostly cloudy
the urgency
in the robo-caller’s voice

puppy love
the bite marks
on my hands

unburied treasure
puppy droppings
in the kitchen

too rich for my blood
her designer
peasant blouse

class warfare
the supermodel’s
peasant dress

preparing for take-off
she finds
my favorite dress shirt

no longer
waiting for me
sunset

speed bump
a flat finish
on wall street

cleared by the doctor
a handicapped parking space

is that all there is?
singing a song
i don’t even like

back to work
the dog wins the battle
for my pillow

back to work
the leaves still clinging
to the tree

half moon
savoring
the cheap wine

back to the future
the clock tower
proudly gray

half moon
please repeat
the question

guarding the perfect lawn
a statue
of the virgin mary

restless night
the fog
within

not my cup of tea
this over-roasted coffee

day of the dead
the cactus flower
blossoms

chewing tobacco
the apple
far from the tree

afternoon walk
imagining
i hear a train

afternoon rally
the dog
is happy to see me

sharing tea
with my muse
scent of roses

morning meditation
a little bird navigates
the giant cactus

restless night
the violent insurgence
of my dreams

morning soreness
a lumbering
freight train

hurricane watch
my cocktail
untouched

eye of the storm
a sleeping dog

late for work
pine needles
in her hair

in the skull
of a dead horse
bees make honey

my favorite fragrance
autumn wind
in her hair

peeking through
the autumn haze
velvet moon

after the storm
a murder
of crows

after the storm
the puppy’s tail

autumn chill
the goodwill cashier’s
angry scowl

restless night
the light in our neighbor’s house
that never turns off

hiking the arroyo
a rusted-out
pickup truck

gypsy violin
an old man
weeps

covering
the chipmunk hole
a fallen catalpa leaf

explaining to the crow
that i don’t want
his roadkill

you were always
too good for me
damselfly

always too soon
sunset

on the coldest days i hear it
her name
in the wind

gibbous moon
the dog’s head
on my leg

many beers later
a map of the stars
corrected

covered with graffiti
the sign reads
pueblo mágico

monday morning
two dogs wrestling
in the sun

dusk
somewhere
a burning leaf pile

halloween party
she assures me she’s not
a good witch

in and out of view
dogs chasing after
a squirrel

hunter’s moon
beginning and ending the day
in darkness

that moment
she stops worrying
about her hair

autumn in the cemetery
the whispered prayers
of ghosts

my daydreams wandering
a windowless corridor

afternoon walk
careful not to disturb
the cobwebs

128 traffic
the long journey
nowhere

suburban soundtrack
the hum
of the high-tension wire

saying all
the right things
the wrong person

hunter’s moon
words
elude me

back to work
the dog yawns
in my face

driven to tears
just enough sriracha

halloween
the receptionist’s
stale candy

my son’s apartment
decorated
in early bachelor

autumn rain
helping my mother
up the stairs

winter daydream
the softness beneath
her thick wool sweater

indian summer
the fragrance of curry
through an open window

passing
the crab apple tree
i remember you

a boston lunch
peanut butter
and traffic jam

a moment of clarity
unpainted lines
in the parking lot

crossing the line
pedestrians
and their smart phones

fragrance of curry
a different kind
of indian summer

chasing the train
a styrofoam
coffee cup

rain in the forecast
the morphine
drips

where dreams and nightmares end
a snapped power line

out of gas
the old dog sleeps
with one eye open

late autumn
the yellowed photos
above the bar

outlet mall
everything i don’t want
and more

dimming the lights
the lounge singer’s
bad falsetto

day of the dead
the mouse trap
snaps

trick or treat
no one’s giving out candy
in the ghost town

tonight i’ll dine with him
the grandfather
i never met

turning back the clock
my hair a whiter shade
of white

trick of treat she said
nudging me
with her pitchfork

halloween night
hoping all the zombies
stay home

turning back the clock
the dog’s
first nudge

all saints’ day
she lets
her hair down

sports pub
a few minutes of football
between viagra commercials

before i can find the words
november dusk

an extra hour
to say goodbye
to daylight

bare tree limbs
the wind
sighs

knowing my place
freshly painted lines
in the parking lot

mergers and acquisitions
the dog steals a toy
from its playmate

bittersweet
the sugar maple’s
falling leaves

an important announcement
the clanging dumpster

the early bird
not at all interested
in the worm

meeting the new boss
my unmatched socks

meditation in progress
the hum
of a fluorescent light

election day
the perfect zen
of an empty ballot

stock options
how far to put the cart
ahead of the horse?

writer’s block
a cardinal
on a bare branch

all souls’ day
wild flowers
in the arroyo

harvest moon
grass gone to seed
on the tennis court

before coffee
my morning walk
with ghosts

unseasonably mild
the so-called hot sauce

now leasing
the unseen
emptiness

cold snap
once again
asking why

unicorns and rainbows
another year
until the election

unseasonably mild
she unbuttons
that button

writer’s block
a moving van idles
in the parking lot

moving day
the largest box
marked miscellaneous

huddled smokers
another conversation
about the cloud

off the hook
her fishnet sweater

in the weeds
a broken picnic table

trumpet solo
the mood turns
black and white

construction zone
a woodpecker
in the maple tree

the tour bus idles
an abandoned
mining town

the abandoned church
where i asked her
to run away with me

waning moon
one more beer
than i needed

overcast
following the gps
to the wrong side of town

shorter days
a stranger’s
familiar face

losing my appetite
the jogger’s man-bun

lost in thought
an abandoned pier
battered by waves

deep in thought
blue heron

the jukebox to myself
i play
another sad song

a stray dog’s stare
where the weeping willow
used to be

on someone’s cell phone
three missed calls
from mom

fall color
the waitress shows off
her new tattoo

the sun sets
with or without
the tv on

second sunset
an unannounced
missile test

home from work
day after day
the same empty mailbox

early sunset
an empty bottle
of wine

ready to bury
best deal
in bomb shelters

back to work
a pair of sneakers
dangling from a wire

back to work
a layer of frost
on my windshield

rock bottom
there’s no place
like home

at the end of the hallway
an open door
marked do not enter

even the dead ones
stand at attention
a row of poplars

paper clip
barely keeping it
together

welcome to your life
everybody wants
to rule the world

impenetrable clouds
a blocked phone number

veteran’s day
i count all of the wars
in my lifetime

more fragile
than i imagined
a childhood photo

knowing
we need the rain
we curse the rain

losing a bet
i await
my prize

christmas cheer
the color
of a coffee cup

cheap whiskey
the cold cruel rain

stuck inside
a sudden need
to feel the rain

a personalized email
promising me
a fuller head of hair

a drafty hallway
how much coffee
to wash away the rain?

stepping into
a noisy hallway
for privacy

after the information session
i drive home in the dark

playing hide-and-seek
a wasp nest
finds me

my morning walk
wiping the smile
from a stranger’s face

in the waiting room
heads bowed
in social networking

explain to me again
how climbing the stairs
is just like falling

rainy day
the worn wooden paneling
of a local pub

another day of rain
a ghost
on the highway

nostalgia night
trying to remember
when i last felt nostalgic

friday the thirteenth
she asks
if i want to get lucky

in my nightmare
the whine
of a dentist’s drill

under construction
my late morning
beer buzz

under construction
my unconstructive
attitude

a small dog
cowering in the wind
it’s a mad, mad world

starless night
a failure
to communicate

gunmen at large
no stars tonight

mid-november
a withered
habanero plant

soft target
my bloated
bourgeois belly

new moon
a lone wolf
howling at nothing

autumn wind
a voice calling out
for dad

another sunset
and we still need
a starting pitcher

at the corner
of hello and goodbye
only one of us

winking at me
the evening’s first star

hand in hand
the old rottweiler
disapproves

writer’s block
the thermometer
doesn’t budge

crescendo
long after
the music stops

meanwhile
beirut also burns

meanwhile
my grandfather’s tombstone
in the wind

morning gridlock
a woman fills in
her eyebrows

waiting for the interview
a borrowed clip-on tie

writer’s block
wires dangling
from the ceiling

in the waiting room
a riveting
weather forecast

clear autumn night
wondering what
the dog dreams

waiting for the sun
the last leaf
clings

waiting for the sun
the last leaf clings
to the tree

driving into the sun
a passing train

improvisation
a brand new way
to do the same damned thing

cleaning my glasses
i see the clouds
more clearly

fearing
the immigrants
sons of immigrants

in your arms
my rage
dissolves

but for my fair skin
the cop waves me on

coyote’s howl
a new meaning
to dead of night

morning frost
the weight of the dog’s snout
against my leg

morning frost
the dog’s snout
against my leg

safety first
an important phone call
from the top of a ladder

moving vans
another startup
shuts down

dressed to kill
she stares at her phone
as i walk by

shooting star
my youngest grandchild’s
first steps

national security
the other shoe
drops

same time as yesterday
missing the i
in i love you

overcast
i stick
to my story

only slightly lost
i know where i’m not

only slightly lost
i know where
i’m not wanted

bombed into the stone age
by enlightened savages

i’ve finally found it
the place where everyone
goes to hide

wringing my hands
the early train
running late

reflecting
reluctant daylight
the cat’s whiskers

revolution day
a stubborn cowlick

revolution day
my turn to hit
the trump pinata

fresh scapegoat
served with a side
of hypocrisy

if you have to ask
it’s too early
christmas lights

unseasonably warm
she fans her cleavage
with the dinner menu

after the fireworks
a tender kiss

starless night
an empty bottle
of hot sauce

cold snap
she was only trying
to be polite

snowbirds
groaned my father
a snowbird who stayed

winter storm
another grandchild
on the way

wax museum
trying to avoid
another meltdown

at the end of the bar
so much room
in hell

cat out of the bag
another grandchild
in the oven

raw autumn night
where the tattoo
was removed

blessing the pigeons
on mission street
sidewalk jesus

high school reunion
the short bald fat guy
who bullied me

gone too soon
the cocktail
i named after her

the expression on my face
when i find out
she’s expecting

november sunlight
an unattended door
propped open

in an otherwise empty hallway
the knowing nod
of a fellow wanderer

clouds of dust
i brush against
the plastic plant

moving day
that new carpet smell

dimming the lights
she whispers
i have plans for you

writer’s block
the trailing zeroes
of my dreams

retirement daydream
the palm branches’
faint whisper

rainbows on the water
i miss the last ferry

november frost
wondering what to do
about the unused meds

same time as yesterday
looking for work
is a full-time job

building better walls
between the spaces
between us

reminding me of you
a dim and drafty corridor

a crashing wave
the wrinkles on my face
dissolve

not a care in the world
a homeless man’s
purple kite

sweeping
the cracked sidewalk
sunrise

beaver moon
too busy
to take it in

autumn rain
my mother’s
wary steps

clinging
to a barbed wire fence
a child’s jacket

hunter’s moon
loneliness
finds me

autumn wind
i turn up the volume
of a sad song

autumn wind
i turn up
a sad song

late-season storm
yes i’m old enough
to know better

late-season storm
another
broken promise

thanksgiving morning
in search for a pagan
selling eggs

thanksgiving parade
two dogs
chasing a rabbit

thanksgiving at the sports bar
just grateful
for the noise

meanwhile at the dog pound
a christmas present
that didn’t work out

poking through the snow
next year’s christmas tree

happy thanksgiving!
but i’ll be happier when
the christmas music stops

back bay bistro
i order an entrée
i can’t pronounce

november fog
searching for
the hunter’s moon

black friday
trying to remember
when it meant something else

black friday
the season’s
first christmas card

unseasonably mild
the rich girl’s
smart pant suit

on the right side of town
brick crosswalks
for non-pedestrians

black friday gridlock
a column of christmas trees
strapped to suvs

november rain
they say he died
on a day like this

leftover turkey
the wishbone
already broken

holiday crowds
the bomb-sniffing dog’s
tail wags

assimilated
we mock
grandma’s accent

a hug from a stranger
who says
i have his eyes

throwing a tantrum
the little girl
with angel wings

under the bridge
a sneaking suspicion
i’m not alone

shadows in the desert
a cacophony
of helicopters

waking from a nightmare
a nun tells me
not to slouch

shadows in the desert
a century plant
stands tall

frost advisory
she asks
is that what you’re wearing?

hummingbird
i forget
the question

desert dream
the ghost
has no face

happy hour
i drink
the ocean breeze

in the abstract painting
i am running
from my nightmare

passing the homeless man
i look for a window
with a nicer view

climbing the walls
bittersweet

afraid of strangers
i cover up
my mirrors

overcast
a failure
to communicate

always the practical one
a spare condom
in my wallet

december
i thought i had
more time

cold draft
someone enters a pin
on the atm

a vision in a dream
i drink the milk
of paradise

gripping the pen
to sign a new contract
the new ace

a chip off the old block
the one who never calls

all that matters
is a red wheelbarrow
with a broken wheel

writer’s block
the hum
of a fluorescent light

outfoxed
by the dog
i lose my pillow

corrected
when i say happy holidays
i take it back

today’s traffic report
continued gridlock
at the morgue

lockdown
lost
for words

self-aware
my smart phone
googles itself

exit interviews
in a room
without windows

broken clouds
i finally notice
she dyed her hair

happy holidays
the annual argument
over visitation

downtown crossing
strangers sharing
a mutual distrust

now serving
an all-night menu
of free-range speculation

political graffiti
a whitewashed wall

hot jazz
the sax player
wipes his lips

hallway daydream
every exit is an entrance
somewhere else

dog walk
the pace quickens
where he last saw a cat

visualizing
world peace
i twist my ankle

angry with myself
winter sea

quick and to the point
the death poem
i wrote for you

moonless night
the unblinking eyes
of a shelter dog

sidestepping
the wino
her hair crisis

domestic terrorism
winter moths
at the door

designated for assignment
the can’t-miss prospect
who never played

writer’s block
trying to capture
her blank expression

late autumn rally
the squirrels
gather acorns

sleeping
the day away
lighthouse

on the back
of a tombstone
my unwritten death haiku

western civilization
a fine idea

peace on earth
the dog’s
heavy sigh

at the dog park
lovers
unleashed

over cocktails
it might have been a good weekend
to put up christmas lights

cruel hoax
poems from
a secret admirer

black ice
i forget
what we were arguing about

if i told you
i believed in heaven
would you meet me there?

climbing
the skyscraper shadows
a busker’s sax

blue monday
a freshly painted wall

waiting for santa
another unfunded startup

on the campaign trail
crowds applaud
an overflowing cesspool

waning moon
the dog sighs

waning moon
the dog sleeps
the drunks howl

frost on the windshield
scraping away
my hangover

baja sunset
the amber hue
of an aged tequila

under the mistletoe
a sloppy kiss
from the dog

under the mistletoe
just you and me
in our birthday suits

enlightenment
i am drinking
someone else’s beer

crowded bus
the comfortable silence
between us

overcast
an empty
train yard

karaoke bar
the sour mix
of notes

karaoke bar
another more rendition
of my way

freedom trail
closed to those
seeking freedom

another dead rock star
these conversations kill

mostly cloudy
waving to a stranger
i thought i knew

under construction
the next haiku

how does good wine
get better
if we don’t drink it?

unseasonably mild
we break out
the good wine

hair plugs
the echo
of a leaky faucet

holiday party
the gift of cleavage
in the workplace

new moon
a stranger asks
if i know jesus

downtown crossing
a stranger asks
if i know jesus

overcast
a locked door
at the employment office

cubicle farm
something growing
in the trash

winter moths
the buzz
of the bass

truth or dare
a pair
of ghost peppers

when i’m not sleeping
i dream
of being my dog

fog advisory
the morning after
is always too soon

celebrating
the water main break
a flock of geese

wall street swoons
but my dog dreams
of butterflies

my son’s new address
a state of flux

new moon
i feel
so old

mosque on fire
arson
in the name of jesus

new moon
the sky demands
a sad song

moonless night
another promise
broken

bright lights
another song
about the dark

new moon
a christmas card
from a total stranger

on hold
bing crosby dreams
of a white christmas

slowly spinning
around its axis
24-hour news

slowly spinning
around itself
24-hour news

holiday bustle
a woodpecker
in a bare tree

crowded cafe
they are all out
of joy

crowded cafe
the barrista flirts
with schoolgirls

a question of faith
she crosses herself
when i enter the room

crescent moon
her slow
striptease

heart of darkness
i order my coffee
black

shouting over christmas carols
for a pair of chopsticks

unseasonably mild
our hands touch
reaching for the hot sauce

writer’s block
a cardboard box
marked trash

the lights go on
in a room
that doesn’t exist

waiting for x-rays
a plastic skeleton
with reindeer antlers

beneath a canopy of clouds
an old man
playing air guitar

kaleidoscope
she dreams
in technicolor

solstice
she names
the stars

invited
to an affair
in my spam folder

clearing skies
an unbroken
egg yolk

wellesley center
a speeding hearse
runs a red light

waking from a nightmare
a hearse
runs a red light

truth or dare
she gets
on top

not seen
on the x-ray
my rich inner life

craving sushi
the raw
winter wind

shots fired
dreaming
on the wrong side
of the tracks

the call for war
i let it go
to voicemail

take a deep breath and hold
the titanium
that holds me together

eyes full of wine
i order coffee
online

wall street rallies
fishing boats
on a distant horizon

lost in translation
the language
of my ancestors

yankee swap
i leave
with a headache

cougar crossing
her jaguar
cuts me off

watching the news
my inner child
runs away

pot luck
a familiar fragrance
in the parking lot

entangled
with you
in my dreams

stormy weather
another glass
of wine

winter wind
our tangled limbs

too young
to be my daughter
she calls me daddy

chess match
who has
the bigger vp?

winter mist
knocking on the door
of an empty room

a pain in the neck
the ceiling tiles
misaligned

alone in the stairwell
the long spiral
downward

on a treadmill
the feeling
i’m going nowhere

star wars
lost beyond
the rain clouds

after we tango
the dance
begins

in the holiday spirit
bag lady puts a hex
on passing shoppers

writer’s block
photos of snowfall
somewhere else

up is down
keith richards
turns 72

wall street
potholes
deepening

winter mist
i didn’t
miss it

searching for inspiration
the mold on a fallen tree

princess of suburbia
the quest
for artisanal bagels

hometown crowd
bad beer shouting
all around me

the bus
headed my way
not in service

revolution
the moth
circles a flame

under lock and key
the local church’s
nativity scene

some assembly required
i ask my son
what his plans are

reality bites
his mounting losses
at fantasy football

ringing in
my damaged eardrums
winter silence

gallows humor
it seemed funnier
before the hanging

frost warning
the baby grabs a handful
of my white hair

winter solstice
i pocket dial
a stranger

winter solstice
the streetlight
burns out

winter sunrise
a dog toy
on my pillow

holiday gridlock
an x-ray
of my spine

abandoned on the sidewalk
a sign that reads
everything must go

mall traffic
the tightness
in my hamstrings

longest night
a double dose
of viagra

winter solstice
darkness
waits for me

writer’s block
the axe blade
caught on a knot

winter rain
the countdown
to oblivion

an axe to grind
lumberjacks
on strike

winter rain
another conversation
about mom

early sunset
how long this journey
into goodnight

unseasonably warm
her smile
is not for me

unseasonably warm
her smile

done with christmas shopping
the long line
at the liquor store

the great sphinx
an old cat
glares at me

tornado warning
the dog
in need of exercise

longest night
the chop and sizzle
of a food truck

pigeons
lining up
for the food truck

winter rain
the christmas lights
shiver

christmas eve
an army of eager faces
at the apple store

was it all a dream?
a monkey
gone to heaven

wise men
still follow
on twitter

christmas morning
the traditional exchange
of children

keep the ex
out of xmas

one year later
i still dislike
egg nog

far from home
i explain the recipe
for an egg cream

finally
some alone time
christmas moon

christmas moon
if i could
only see it
see it

war
fathers
burying sons

boxing day
the silence
of unclaimed baggage

boxing day
a funeral procession
of christmas trees

boxing day
all the christmas wrap
in the recycle bin

christmas guests gone
we unwrap our gifts
to each other

at a crossroads
and no idea
how i got here

merry christmas!
my grandson pokes me
with a light saber

crossing the border
a white-winged dove

snow in the forecast
i turn off
a familiar song

two cocktails later
a crack
in the faux tin ceiling

after a long weekend
the worn-out carpet
around my desk

telling the silent shadows
that they’re better off
as friends

remembering our last vacation
an airline ticket
for a bookmark

winter weather advisory
taking inventory
of the wine

my liberal guilt
as the state trooper
waves me through

after dark
an unfamiliar place
i recognize

as if it matters
snow in the forecast

first snow
anxious
snow plows

right where i left it
a whiskey flask
in the tool box

a lazy barge
under the rusty old bridge
of my dreams

first snow
the wildflowers
bow

snow turns to rain
wondering when
it all went wrong

first snow
last year’s christmas tree
in its natural element

waning moon
the doctor asks
how much i drink

first snow
the rise and fall
of flannel sheets

walking on ice
i remember
to breathe

new year’s day
one resolution
fast asleep

winter fly
interrupting
my tropical daydream

new year’s eve
resolution
gridlock

ice storm
i’ve said
too much

solving for x
an equation
of irrational numbers

freezing fog
exactly
how i feel

last day of the year
sunshine reflected
in the snow melt

enlightenment
an empty hallway

new year’s eve
a light
in an empty office

never too late
one more gift left
to unwrap

new year’s eve
another year
leaves me cold

new year’s day
spent coffee grounds
in the compost bucket

tipping the scales
last year’s resolution

snow squall
she asks if the dogs
are playing or fighting

snow squall
the old dog
snores

speechless
when the waitress asks
is this y’all’s order?

a vivid memory
not letting the cat
out of the bag

south boston pub
a yankee cap
on the dart board

at the crossroads
clearing snow
from solar panels

first thaw
someone should have warned
the daffodils

out of coffee
the raging river
recedes

out of coffee
the raging river

smooth as silk
her trembling skin

writer’s block
a cardinal
on a bare tree branch

this ringing in my ears
drowns out the voices
of ghosts

quieting my rage
your tender lips

a recurring nightmare
of the dystopian hellscape
we called home

not softened
by sepia tones
images of war

cold weather ahead
i let the call
go to voicemail

a matter of trust
the key breaks off
in a frozen lock

cranking up the motor
the captain asks
if i have my sea legs

monday morning chill
stocks and temperatures
fall

single-digit temperatures
i count
my fingers

stripping to a bikini
the captain asks
if i brought my sea legs

always
the right words
on her lips

caught in the act
chalk dust
on my tiny hands

epiphany
the starstruck masses

epiphany
a dead mouse
at the door

epiphany
the gift of a dead mouse
at the door

uncarbonated beer
wall street
finishes flat

all smiles
trying to pretend
it’s not a blind date

epiphany
jesus and mary
stopped at the border

feeling like snow
my granddaughter’s hands
in my hair

let the games begin
a kitten
and a ball of yarn

that recurring dream
in which i pull the fire alarm
and run

winter dusk
watching the
jackpot rise

cozy pub
just the right
amount of dust

as if
it could feel the cold
a dead oak tree

floating on the sea
fair-weather clouds
and me

the perfect beach
her outstretched palms
beckon me

sitting by the wood stove
the fire
within

tremor on wall street
the sound
of breaking china

crescent moon
the dog curls up
next to me

long day ahead
i stifle a yawn

occupying wall street
the ghosts
of my retirement dreams

how its stillness
moves me
blue heron

tomorrow’s forecast
a shower
of losing lottery tickets

low hanging clouds
all the dreams
i’ve forgotten

remembering
when she called me
her sweet potato pie

no secrets
moonlight shines through
the palapa roof

my stock portfolio
puddles filled
with winter rain

at the town dump
one more activist
with a clipboard

speculation
how will i spend
the jackpot i won’t win?

mixed precipitation
how will i spend
the jackpot i won’t win?

against the odds
i play powerball

gallery opening
the graffiti artist
posing for selfies

winter rain
a losing
powerball ticket

emptying the wine bottle
another conversation
about mom

longer than the night
her legs

in my spare time
the silence when i ask
about backups

new moon
time to lose
the beard

hat trick
the striker’s
man-bun

new moon
the past
behind me

amber sky
our tangled limbs

blue monday
the stars look
very different today

a long winter
the gray-haired parents
of a toddler

new moon
dreams of a house
i’ve never been in

the dance floor shakes
not sure if you’re
a boy or a girl

lengthening days
seeing her legs
in a new light

kissing
those delicious lips
with my eyes

snow in the forecast
our late dog’s ashes

graffiti glistening
in the flickering streetlight

regrets
waiting for
the light to change

always in season
her fishnet stockings

in a dark place
quietly fermenting
homebrew

light snowfall
the market
closes higher

converting to condos
the nightclub
where we met

state of the union
dysfunctional

sleepless night
an idling snowplow

evening meditation
a snowplow
strikes the curb

driftwood
yearning to be
part of something

contemplating my legacy
a losing powerball ticket

the one
who sings the songs
in my head

the long narrow hallway
that leads
to oblivion

in the dancing light
hot tramp
i love you so

the one
i never had
punk rock girl

icy conditions
another slide
on wall street

crescent moon
leaning her head
against my shoulder

removing
my no regrets
tattoo

telling myself
it should have been me
the dog’s tail wags

listed as
my great-grandfather’s professsion
jornalero

her kitchen
one plate short
of a banquet

cruel tease
the tattoo
she won’t show me

blackstar
the only one
i see tonight

counting stars
the one the gypsy woman
told me about

rondena
taking away the breath
i was saving for sunrise

hitching a ride
the ghost of a girl
i left behind

on a desert highway
can man’s
rusty bicycle

lost highway
the nightmare
i can’t let go

stuck behind
a schoolbus
thunderclouds

writer’s block
somewhere
beyond the clouds

snow flurries
my unborn grandchild’s
perfect fingers

preparing for a trip
a hawk
in low-hanging branches

the dow falls
rose petals
in the wind

getting warmer
the taste
of her sweat

my every dream
a pocketful
of posies

burnt toast
a dream
i missed my flight

winter rain
choking down
airport coffee

winter rain
a crying baby
on the plane

an untimely reminder
the nearest exit
may be behind me

rough air
the on-time departure
of my breakfast

above the clouds
all the words
i’ve yet to write

melting snow
an unfinished
haiku

always on time
the thundering herd
of rude passengers

no need for a runway
a sparrow
in terminal 4

pulling away
from the gate
broken storm clouds

final approach
she pencils in
her eyebrows

awaiting trial
a glass tank marked
fresh lobster

mailing a sympathy card
with a forever stamp

quite a catch
the way she poses
in fishnet stockings

ocean walk
i won’t come back
without a mermaid

flying coach
i feel
my surgical scar

unable to sleep
unable to stay awake
the jet engine’s roar

in a dream
crescent moon
above the palms

pale sky
all the gringos
with suntans

suddenly
i’m the hot topic
he was always so quiet

not a mile out of cabo
i yield
to a lumbering bull

road runner
i watch
for falling rocks

my dream awaits
with outstretched palms
and thundering waves

outdoor festival
i am the freak
without tattoos

baja noon
a dog digging
for sand crabs

baja farmers’ market
another vegetable
we don’t recognize

baja midnight
what to do
with the last lime

wearing me down
persistent waves

knowing i can’t stay
i already long
for where i am

chasing a fly
around the kitchen
with the roof on fire

holy mackerel!
fishermen blockading
a construction site

baja sunrise
the fragrance
of damiana

sharing a language
the desert shadows
and me

low tide
sunbathers
and their cell phones

in a sleepy fishing village
the supermodel’s torn stockings

perched atop
the old cactus
a silent dove

roadside shrine
two empty beer cans
perfectly placed

passion fruit
remembering
the last time
it rained

cloudless sky
another call
gone to voicemail

rough surf
wondering when
i became so angry

hypnotized by the waves
but always knowing
i could get that call

cactus flower
the mezcal
kicks in

late summer
the rookie’s
spotless uniform

fair-weather clouds
the rich girl’s
peasant blouse

the pounding surf
how little
i’ve learned

desert flower
almost too beautiful
for a name

morning meditation
the tireless whine
of a leaf blower

surf’s up!
a young dog
chasing seagulls

tequila ranch
only the cacti remain

fatal crash
plastic jesus
escapes unscathed

house finch
wondering why
we’re here

heavy sigh
i become
the dog’s pillow

writer’s block
an unbroken
egg yolk

thank you sparrow
for making sure
i never eat alone

the dow falls
a red-tailed hawk
perched above the huerta

icicles
hanging from the rim
of a basketball net

tightening her grip
preparing
for lift-off

in the low-lying palm branches
the faint whispers of ghosts

low-lying palm branches
whispers of ghosts

intoxicating
agave nectar
on her lips

receding
beyond the horizon
sunset

early to bed
the candle
winks

ocean breeze
the mockingbird’s
silence

after sunset
a cowboy
on his smartphone

laughing baby
i can’t touch
my toes

before
i can thank her
the moon sets

unable to sleep
waxing moon

baja morning
a dune buggy
chased by dogs

her naked silhouette
the perfect sunset

chased away
by the waves
everything

what could go wrong?
the beach mansion’s
cinder block construction

guarding
the empty beach
a lone cactus

such a big name
for a tiny flower
bougainvillea

united
in knowing
we could never be
together

priced for quick sale
somebody’s dream
with a view

beyond the fiery rhetoric
an imminent darkness

atop the dying cactus
a pair of mourning doves

beautiful in flight
and then it lands
turkey vulture

hushing the mockingbird
who knows
i can’t stay

asking her
to spend the night
gibbous moon

at the foot of
a se vende sign
a hollowed-out skull

if only i
could make it last
baja sunset

the farmer’s daughter
in love
an overripe pomegranate

not a care in the world
a statue
in the courtyard

amber moon
maybe it really is
made of cheese

desert wind
a burro’s tail
chasing flies

desert morning
the restless clatter
of the water truck

repeating myself
i remind myself
of my mother

lost
in an ocean wave
all of my words

lost in an ocean wave
all the words
i meant to say

last of the tequila
trying to drink
it all in

when there’s nothing
left to say
desert breeze

wolf moon
a stray dog
in the road

a sudden chill
she tells me i was handsome
back in the day

desert fog
all the times
we didn’t kiss

is it wrong
that their song makes me smile?
mourning doves

clean slate
my mother doesn’t remember
our argument

surgical scars
an abandoned marina
at 30,000 feet

between
moon and cloud
a private jet

airport layover
snow
on the monitor

airport jetway
the cold reality
of winter

now boarding
the baggage handler’s
gentle touch

above the clouds
a promise
i can’t keep

promised to no one
the promised land

cleared for landing
it all
hits home

the old cathedral
a baby answers
its echo

while we were gone
rabbit tracks
in the fresh snow

partial thaw
her fashionably
bare shoulder

heads i lose
she gets
on top

gibbous moon
an abandoned dog
in a field

imagining
it’s the ocean
the roar
of the mass pike

in a windowless hallway
dreams
of ocean breezes

waiting for the food truck
rumors and innuendo

at the bottom
of the snowbank
old news

heads i win
she gets
on top

after the storm
we reach for
the same wine glass

winter overcast
my head cold
goes viral

winter morning
i put on
a wrinkled shirt

winter overcast
the distant sound
of the ocean

early sunset
how soon until
pitchers and catchers report?

between doses
of cough medicine
silence

winter warmer
i imagine her
naked

dive bar
pretending not
to recognize each other

a cover band
i like less
than the original

a desert flower
too beautiful
for a name

the dog finds his own bed
when the cough medicine
wears off

snow in the forecast
remembering the right way
to drink mezcal

gibbous moon
somewhere
i’d rather be

midnight blues
i still have the key
to her back door

midnight blues
the key
to her back door

too tired to think
i run
for president

black ice warning
a pile of empty nips
in the trash

snow flurries
the right way
to drink mezcal

it happens, she says,
ocean waves
perfectly calm

hawk versus dove
i look for
the shovel

in the waiting room
heads bowed
in solemn texting

not flattered
that my retirement portfolio
looks thinner

finally friday
another log
for the fire

writer’s block
this is not a haiku
about iowa

continued cold
i order another
frozen margarita

broken clouds
the pit bull’s
giant smile

separated from
the funeral procession
the widow’s old jalopy

happiness
a place
in the sun

the awkward silence
when i ask
about the kids

you’re up early
she says
with a smile

taking the plunge
great white pelican

early to bed
that look

winter wind
the secrets
i don’t want to hear

at the end of the hallway
a door
marked don’t

touring the brewery
spent grain
at the bottom of the tank

unseasonably mild
the politician’s
limp handshake

stirring the mole
abuelita’s smile
when i ask for the recipe

like it was yesterday
those restless waves

the uncomfortable silence
when she asks
for my blessing

a kiss
before i leave
her sleepy smile

desert dream
children playing
in the rain

hope springs eternal
just like last year

windless night
the bug zapper
sizzles

knowing the hypnotized never lie
i try to break your trance

thin ice
thinking this could be
a mild winter

starless night
i dream
that i am sleepwalking

head over heels
a patch of ice
on the sidewalk

sobriety check
i cash it
at the bar

morning meditation
the ringing
in my ears

groundhog day
i step on
my shadow

young mezcal
maybe winter
was just a bad dream

in a city park
an old man playing chess
against himself

an old man
playing dominoes
against himself

layoff rumors
not a cloud
in the sky

ignoring me intensely
a crested caracara

groundhog day
setting my alarm
to repeat

cold snap
she offers
to keep me warm

a deep breath
finding my place
in the snow

oh
the way
she eats
a cherry

waning crescent moon
i savor
the cheap wine

he looks familiar
the straight-a student
who never raises his hand

punching my ticket twice
the overzealous train conductor

winter rain
someone’s resume
left on the printer

running
at full capacity
the rumor mill

winter sunset
the lines on my face
lengthen

winter rain
a playlist
of sad songs

leftovers for dinner
a mixed stock market

wind advisory
whispers
in the hallway

a recent photo
even in black-and-white
i look gray

unseasonably warm
i need
to stay cool

tomorrow’s forecast
snow
and a headache

snow in the forecast
the candidates’
withering bluster

snow in the forecast
we keep
each other warm

starless night
i don’t know
what to believe

undebatable
the growing list
of unkept promises

no debate
i walk the dog
in the rain

red wine
the taste
of your lips

water cooler
conversation
growing heated

fallen trees
not as pretty
as the postcard

bowing
under heavy snow
old tree limbs

after the storm
an amber glow
above the trees

writer’s block
a drawer filled
with dried-out pens

decades later
i enjoy ramen
because i want to

young at heart
bubble gum
in my hipster beard

existential crisis
i step
in dog shit

a deep bow
the tired limbs
of an old oak

at the bottom of a box
my baby picture
worn around the edges

defining ironic
a hipster and i
with the same glasses

winter wonderland
wondering
why i’m here

after the storm
a chorus
of generators

whiskey morning
a headache
the size of my fist

super bowl sunday
the dog chases
a ladybug

snow in the forecast
another going-away party

super bowl sunday
let the games
begin

snow in the forecast
the bare tree branches
tremble

snow in the forecast
empty supermarket shelves
predicted

snow in the forecast
we predict
empty supermarket shelves

super bowl sunday
lights
and clothes
are off

gentle
as a winter breeze
lay-off rumors

layoff rumors
trimming broken branches
from the dogwood tree

meditation in progress
the mole
on his neck

gallows humor
the crowd grows
dead quiet

news from wall street
her plunging
neckline

always willing
to wait for me
snow

spring snow
i tried to warn
the daffodils

now renting
the condemned apartment
my grandmother died in

crowded elevator
the speakers play
whole lotta love

snow flurries
i drink my coffee
too fast

special delivery
a bundle
of nerves

company meeting
everyone looks
for who’s not there

mardi gras
the sizzle
of fresh bacon

february sun
the wind shifts
from football to baseball

asked for his position
on the issues
he replies doggy style

dark day
the unconquerable cold

cold-brewed coffee
the weatherman
got it wrong

police sirens
another night
without the moon

ash wednesday
a dusting
of snow

survivor’s guilt
i order another
extra special bitter

budget cuts
a crescent moon
on the horizon

calling me the wrong name
he says
keep in touch

survivor’s guilt
another bitter

fighting back the tears
i add more hot sauce

forever in my dreams
a desert rose

gravitational waves
so many
sad goodbyes

just when
i needed it most
baja sunrise

undocumented
this sunrise
across the border

einstein’s refrigerator
an empty milk carton
and a case of beer

single-digit temperatures
a pedestrian
flips me off

bitter cold
stuck behind
another school bus

brutally cold
the killer’s
mug shot

where there’s smoke
her eyes

continued cold
the yellow patches
in the snow bank

keeping me warm
the fire
in her eyes

continued cold
a form letter
from the editor

always waiting for me
ghost train

following the gps
i zigged
instead of zagged

valentine’s day
your irresistible
softness

survivor’s guilt
the pillow doesn’t
hug me back

disappearing
into its shadow
mighty oak

that recurring nightmare
when i can’t
find my train

undebatable
the brutal
winter wind

world domination
a candle
in the wind

out of words
the next breath
is enough

off-duty pundits
now serving
free-range speculation

writer’s block
i pick up a penny
from the the sidewalk

valentine’s day massacre
my sandwich
falls apart

valentine’s day massacre
time to fill out
my tax return

desolation peak
the quest
for fire

record cold
the radio plays
almost blue

tie game
my stomach
in knots

bear market
a discount
on cheap wine

president’s day
the radio plays
send in the clowns

after the layoffs
the cobwebs
still in place

snow flurries
the unblinking eyes
of a stray dog

now batting
her eyelashes
at the all-star slugger

warming trend
shedding another layer
with my eyes

that recurring nightmare
where every side street
runs the wrong way

flush with fever
the comfort
of a recurring nightmare

music to my ears
snow melting
from the trees

clearing the room
a drunken heckler’s zingers

entering the gallery
without a ticket
a common housefly

winter wedding
the bridegroom’s
cold feet

wind advisory
another candidate
breezes into town

wind advisory
another candidate’s
stump speech

days of future past
hal sings daisy bell

extra crispy
the grateful dead
cover band

after the rain
a blue jay
at the finch feeder

dirty snow
wiping the campaign rhetoric
from my boots

hot bikini
with a side order
of cold shoulder

winter twilight
the color
of a sigh

my spam folder
runneth over
with self-improvement

crowded waiting room
reading the clinic’s
privacy statement

halfway across the zip line
i drop my bucket list

in the cheap seats
a drunk fan puts a hex
on the right fielder

melting snow
pitchers and catchers
report

driving me crazy
the cabbie’s
conspiracy theories

so close
i can taste it
habanero

so close
i can taste it
her bare shoulder

winter dusk
we’ve grown so tired
of one another

on the beach
my bikini-clad
daydream

starry night
my password transmitted
in the clear

wondering if
the empty subway car
is lonely

shelter in place
a stray dog’s
unblinking eyes

baja sunrise
the sky explodes

reflecting nothing
her cubic zirconia ring

where’s the dog?
waiting for
the other shoe
to drop

two-hour meeting
shadows creep
across the table

frost on the windshield
i remember how much
i drank last night

overcast
no moon
for the dog
to bark at

decades after adolescence
a nostalgic pimple

comparing bottles
of sunscreen
the snowbird

the moon’s complexion
a lot like mine

gibbous moon
she’s not telling
the whole truth

so many lifetimes later
my grandfather’s eyes

asleep at the wheel
the ghost cabbie
of my nightmares

winter sunset
sharing a beer
with my regrets

deep winter
trying to remember
a happy song

same time as last year
tuning a guitar
i can’t play

was it only a dream?
the bridge
that wasn’t there

pure blue
a broken
robin’s egg

winter sunshine
stepping over
the dead sparrow

false spring
a dog straining
at the leash

full moon
the dog chases a cat
up a tree

wolf moon
the dog chases a cat
up a tree

wolf moon
that glimmer
in her eyes

on-line horoscope
page not found

wolf moon
the dog’s
faraway look

hoping it lingers
a little bit longer
twilight

low-hanging clouds
a night
without dreams

identity theft
someone mispronounces
my name

winter returns
i should have warned
the daffodils

refilling my prescription
hunger moon

hunger moon
her hair
perfectly unkempt

morning meditation
a steaming
manhole cover

before coffee
the zombie
in the mirror

wondering
if the squirrels feel safer
knowing they’re being watched

election season
the urgency
in the robo-caller’s voice

winter weather advisory
we recommend
indoor activities

winter weather advisory
a red squirrel
taunts the dog

unable to stay warm
another two week’s notice

the chilling effect
of low oil prices
on wall street

in the zone
a parking ticket
on my windshield

on the campaign trail
crows fighting
over stale bread

at the dog park
lovers
exchanging ear bites

unfamiliar pub
all the regulars
and me

friendly bartender
calling everyone by name
except me

winter rain
the dog and i
exchange sighs

turning up the volume
a drunk
at the bar

clearing the bar
my oppressive silence

a day at the zoo
wondering what the monkey
thinks of me

the moment of truth
she pulls down
my zipper

the moment of truth
the dog corners
a squirrel

overnight storm
a restless dog
between us

violent storm
we hold each other
tenderly

overcast night
but i swore i knew the name
of every star

a coconut falls
she tells me i don’t
look latino

winter sun
we plan
a spontaneous evening

writer’s block
a warm day
turned cold

writer’s block
seeking inspiration
from the zucchini

crowded pub
the bartender won’t
look me in the eye

the waiter’s face
when we ask
for separate checks

crowded pub
the bartender won’t look me
in the eye

suburban pub
nobody
knows me

waiting for the train
a huddled mass
of smartphones

waning moon
i count out
my pain meds

the colorful parrot’s
colorful language
when i ask him for a cracker

designated for assignment
the former ace’s
early retirement

swerving wildly to the right
the old car’s
political bumper stickers

political gridlock
campaign signs
at a busy intersection

instead of bright light
a flickering candle
and then

at the end of the bar
a haiku
without a season word

in this corner
a scorpion
unopposed

carving his initials
with a swiss army knife
the utility player

an old man dancing
to his own rhythm
zydeco

budget crisis
i cut up
my credit cards

unseasonably warm
all the hot air
on the campaign trail

third-party candidate
a tree falls
in the woods

through bare trees
the soft eyes
of a fawn

my hesitation
when she says
she’ll make my dreams come true

winter sunset
with nothing
left to say

dreamless sleep
echoes
in the arroyo

intoxicating
the sangria
on her lips

leap year
neither of us
answers the phone

thanking the academy
for acting
like they care

super tuesday
choosing between
two laxatives

leap year
the dog catches a frisbee
in mid-air

super tuesday
a dream
that ended too soon

the relief when i learn
only metadata
is being collected

too busy daydreaming
to see the girl
of my dreams

scolding the cat
the boy on a time-out
in the corner

winter weather advisory
shouting down
an opposing viewpoint

drinking in another
cloudless winter dusk

partisan politics
a choice between
white and red wine

winter rain
an idling
delivery truck

she doesn’t know what it means
but she knows
she’s not truculent

concession speech
the politician’s
limp handshake

glaring sunshine
the dog barks
at my ringtone

cold front
she catches me
staring at her nipples

angry rhetoric
a red squirrel
on a low-hanging branch

drying out
my wet dream
a fire alarm

facing extinction
the white-haired engineer

central square condos
where my favorite cafe
used to be

long winter night
not missing the snow
that barely missed us

that moment i realize
it’s not called pot any more

missing our turn
a neighborhood
not yet gentrified

missing the turn
a neighborhood
not yet gentrified

waiting for the train
a smoldering cigarette
between the rails

gallery opening
the graffiti artist’s
thrift store sports jacket

lights off
lights on
i still don’t see
the point

snow flurries
trying to remember
when i first turned gray

late winter snow
the conversation turns
to guns

team chemistry
enough moonshine
for everyone

wondering what she means
when she says
to get comfortable

minor league game
legging out a single
for seagulls

the contentious debate
surrounding
contentious debates

telling me
it’s seasonally cold
doesn’t help

imagining my face
when she asks
is this a date?

against my better judgement
i brake
for the squirrel

suburban life
a landfill
becomes a transfer station

dreams of spring
a little boy
chasing a kite

old guitar for sale
no strings attached

secret service agents
surrounding
the free thinker

high desert
the electric silence

cloudless sky
a cabinet filled
with unused pain meds

warming trend
her naked
silhouette

cloudless sky
everyone
i didn’t call today

always growing
the stack of books
i want to read

breaking up
with her guitarist boyfriend
for being too high-strung

waning crescent moon
the dog’s eyes
nearly closed

secluded highway
we turn
the radio off

good in the sack
freshly picked potatoes

amber sky
remembering my grandmother’s
arroz con pollo

spring in the air
a sneezing fit

every time
he says sobriety
i take a shot

the rest is silence
the death valley
of my dreams

on the wagon
and here i thought
he died

he thanks
his higher power
mice in the attic

ephemeral
the best haiku
i almost wrote

late for meditation
i forget
my mantra

the votes are in
i brake
for wild turkeys

spring tide
whitewashing
my memories

spring tide
washing away
my dreams

ghost town
the wind whistles
through a hollow skull

there are no absolutes
he said
with absolute certainty

off the wagon
a few edits
to his wikipedia page

unseasonably warm
the new neighbors greet us
with a hug

lost for words
i miss
the exit

lost for words
she kisses me

top of the food chain
the piercing cry
of a red-tailed hawk

yelp review
the dog
sees a squirrel

winter rain
a birthday reminder
for a dead friend

false spring
the can’t-miss prospect’s
missing fastball

when the levee breaks
moving the wine cellar
to higher ground

sun up
sun down
the rush
of wine

wondering when
we can turn off this reality show
and get real

new moon
and to think
i never liked rum

finally friday
the face in the mirror
even wearier than it appears

road rage
an old car
overheats

new moon
the darkness beneath
his lacquered comb-over

each passing year
more reluctant
to turn the clock ahead

each passing year
i’m more reluctant to
turn the clock ahead

wax on
wax off
the crescent moon

stopping
for the fire truck
cicadas

a promise
that i will always fall asleep
with my favorite book

tell me again
how losing an hour
is saving daylight

ghost town
even the clouds
stay away

world-wise
world-weary
a passport
to nowhere

in an old mining town
construction workers
break ground

i’m pretty sure
what the dog just ate
is not certified organic

in the o
of a no vacancy sign
a sparrow nest

not quite spring
i open the windows
anyway

the look on her face
when i ask how to get rid
of my pain meds

at the town dump
two neighbors
unload gossip

tying the knot
the one
who got away

the old pond
we whisper about
its murky past

the old pond
whispering about
his murky past

church bells
the ringing
in my ears

putting away my baseball cap
i tell myself
it’s only spring training

opening my window
to the approval
of tree frogs

time to kill
but anything
will do

spring sunset
the glitter
of broken glass

company kick-off
i wake up
in the dark

harbor mist
my most
intimate secrets

late winter storm
the dog whimpers
in his sleep

happiness is
the right word

today’s desert
a mathematical constant

the kite of ghosts
police tape
in the wind

a mixed-use facility
where we had
our first date

at peace
and yet slightly wild
my white hair

winter rain
with a chance
of metaphor

wondering what i said
when i talked
in my sleep

rough day on wall street
the dominatrix
into bonds

grounded
the other end
of the wire

my kind of dive bar
the jukebox plays
here comes a regular

winter rain
darkness
finds me

exchanging smiles
a buddha statue
and a well-fed baby

winter mist
my eyelids
grow heavy

amber sunset
it must be time
for a beer

a dream
surrendering
to the undertow

swallowing a sigh
my daughter’s
sales pitch

sabre dance
the call
for war

starless night
i finish the wine
too quickly

the ides of march
asking if
i have a second

in vino veritas
i pretend
to fall asleep

overcast
a place
called winter

under construction
a hallway
of shatter-proof glass

in an empty hallway
the lingering perfume
of ghosts

writer’s block
heating up
the leftovers

cabo sun
traffic stops
for a lumbering bull

march madness
a late-season
snow forecast

the little prince
throwing tantrums
to wild applause

right on time
my one-way trip
to hell

st. patrick’s day
the first green buds
on the old tree

a moment of silence
an old t-shirt retired
to the rag pile

st. patrick’s day
erin
goes bra-less

wondering
which side of the tracks
i’m on

gibbous moon
i ask her
to run away with me

in and out of range
the perfect song
for a lonely road

cold reality
not enough free coffee
to stop the bleeding

cold coffee
wondering how
to stop the bleeding

waiting for the train
the hipster and i
with the same glasses

spring snow
an early harvest
of daffodils

in my dreams
a fly ball
that never lands

posing for
a family portrait
his, hers and theirs

train cancelled
a drunken
serenade

the smile i never saw
on a face
i don’t remember

march madness
one
and done

last day of winter
waking up
on the wrong side
of the news

the wrong side of history
and yet
this bright sunshine

spring sunshine
and to think i was saving
for a rainy day

flying at half-mast
a tattered flag
in an indifferent wind

chasing gold
ladies’ night
at an upscale bar

palm sunday
the taxman’s
sticky fingers

first day of spring
according to
the calendar

lining up the meds
nobody ever promised me
a warranty-free life

weeping softly
in the background
a blues guitar

semana santa
the miracle of the last
styrofoam cooler

semana santa
the last
styrofoam cooler

equinox
my asymmetrical
face

police blockade
pending notification
of next of kin

lost in a crowd
with no known
next of kin

spitting on his hands
between pitches
the veteran slugger

spring break
the old man’s fascination
with cosmic dust

monday morning
i burn
the toast

writer’s block
the sun
in my eyes

melting snow
the nurse searches
for a pulse

melting snow
her long long legs

stuck in a beer bottle
a rose
that never bothered to bloom

thinking i was someone else
he retracts his wave

loneliness
a familiar creak
in the floor

gibbous moon
also incomplete

daydreaming
of sunny beaches
i slip on ice

filing my taxes
an abandoned shopping cart
in the parking lot

crow moon
the candidate’s
beautiful wall

chance of rain
sparrows bathe
in dust

before dawn
always one
twittering bird

sunday market
the earthy language
of the fishermen

hypnotized
by the ceaseless violence
of the ocean

wandering the tired hallways
in search of
undrinkable coffee

gone with the snow
my pale winter tan

crossing the busy highway
a cloud
shaped like a fist

celebrating another year
of giving up lent

a distorted guitar
no clearer
after three beers

puppy love
another breach
in the slip cover

on the campaign trail
a snake flatters
a pack of rats

fountain of youth
closed for repairs

when there’s no one
left to blame
solitaire

over strong coffee
he asks me how i know
who i am

listening for whispers
in the intermittent rain

he walked across
an empty parking lot
screaming at the rain

early bird special
at least fifty
shades of gray

the fog
at the bottom
of this shot glass

sweet sixteen
the long
ride home

first date
she asks
for separate checks

moonless night
apologies made
in the passive voice

first date
she asks for his definition
of intimacy

good friday
even better
on the rocks

high tide
i go
with the flow

warming trend
the season’s first
mini skirt

dreams of summer
a lead-off double

still a greasy spoon
the rebranded gastropub

beautiful
on the inside
mrs. cardinal

self-awareness
never too old
to pop bubble wrap

all hope is lost
until the next
powerball drawing

that look
when you realize
she’s not a little girl

waning moon
shadows
from a broken fence

spring in the air
the girl next door
is a woman

easter sunday
pancakes, eggs and bacon
to raise the dead

easter morning
a six-foot bunny waves
at passing cars

the still of night
what i learned
from the water lilies

easter sunday
the cracked cobblestone
of my old neighborhood

water lilies
a moon
made of cheese

almost april
so many words
yet to bud

morning stillness
mystery lies
in the space between us

easter sunday
a parade
of pastel dresses

spring in the air
a dog
tastes the breeze

waning moon
the bones
that call to me

alone with my thoughts
a sticking
subway door

cold rain
declining
the invitation

gone without a trace
all but
the dirtiest snow

monday morning meeting
i watch
the rain

news of his relapse
how slowly
the rain falls

after the rain
a cacophony
of songbirds

the doctor’s prescription
a blood orange margarita

wrong turn
i shut off
the radio

circle of doom
nobody wants
the last donut

spring cleaning
cropping her out
of a photograph

spring thunder
the garden
becomes electric

an international incident
the last
of the damiana

writer’s block
i rearrange
the poetry magnets

to dream
beyond
the horizon

asked
to define love
a coconut falls

in my spam folder
a sale
on cremation services

hanging up our winter jackets
we talk of cooking on the grill

last call
the bartender shows me
an unlabeled bottle

spring sky
forgetting the name
of every star

my best friend’s daughter
why we can no longer
be friends

missing my train
i remember the lyrics
to that song

worm moon
the mourning dove’s
lonely song

still surprised
to see that white-haired man
in the mirror

dusk
forgetting why i thought
i liked brussels sprouts

spring sunset
i write my initials
in the air

crickets
in imperfect
harmony

a neat pile
of all your letters
before i burn them

wavering
bare branches
in the wind

thickening clouds
a dog
who won’t play

april fool’s day
the long-range forecast
calls for snow

end of the quarter
i fish a penny
out of the fountain

countdown
to when i’ll
regret this tattoo

my dad nods
but he doesn’t hear
the angry wind

filling my wine glass
dreams
of an empty beach

customer support
i’m told that i’m
an edge case

change in the weather
another pot of coffee

more fragile
than i remembered
a childhood photo

snow in the forecast
an opening day
curve ball

rites of spring
the next-door neighbor’s
new au pair

grass goes to seed
it’s time for
the talk

allergy season
i buy another
scratch ticket

weekend rain
i see it all
wash away

under candlelight
she tells me
about her scars

my newest crush
a photo
of unknown origin

spring snow
how quickly it all
melts away

a sudden twinge
azalea blossoms
in the wind

crescent moon
forgetting
her baby’s name

my retirement plan
the ripples
in a mud puddle

breathtaking
a mountain
of unpaid bills

opening day
shadows
in the snow

negative space
the photographer’s
empty walls

snow flurries
wondering when
it all went wrong

snow flurries
the plans
i make

spring snow
the joke
is on me

end of the weekend
i finished that beer
too quickly

the snow begins
a familiar twinge
in my neck

desert flower
it was only
a dream

desert flower
only a dream

waking from a nightmare
the crunch
of road salt

over monday coffee
the conversation shifts to
the walking dead

heavy sigh
the alarm clock
is never late

white shadows
the winter weather advisory
gets extended

ghost stories
another log
on the bonfire

cold hot dogs
opening day
will have to wait

waning moon
a stray dog
chasing cars

a well-kept secret
her recipe
for bamboo chicken

over tequila shots
another game
of truth or dare

restless night
everything that thrives
in the desert

open mic
a tree falls
in the woods

its plastic fangs
the snake that doesn’t
shed its skin

scraping the windshield
the lone and level sands
of my dreams

new construction
chopping down
my childhood

spring twilight
i rebalance
my portfolio

breaking news
the news
is broken

mezcal morning
the church bells
out of sync

warming trend
i’ll believe it
when i see it

not a fussy eater
the beach dog
eating pizza crusts

zooming along
the boardwalk
paparazzi

she has him
well trained
the teacher’s pet

called third strike
the cold april rain

side retired
a tired sigh
from empty seats

full count
a pre-recorded
rally cry

between innings
the peanut vendor’s
perfect pitch

black ice
the doctor would like
to run more tests

wind advisory
he says it’s more
than his opinion

a mother’s vigil
the rhythm
of the ventilator

it’s not ghosts
who empty the trash
at night

may day!
the puppy’s
new toy

new moon
the darkness
within

abandoned at the altar
a searing guitar solo

campaign promises
something the dog
rolled in

a solemn oath
to never take myself
seriously

after the rain
a skyscraper’s
bright glare

a break in the clouds
what a good wine
tastes like

in the scaffolding above
the painter whistles
a familiar melody

rummage sale
everyone’s memories
discounted

only on facebook
deleting my birthday wishes
from a late friend’s wall

leaning forward
she transforms
my point of view

chimney smoke
trying to acquire
a taste for mezcal

broken clouds
a mistake
i’ve yet to make

begging
for table scraps
my pet peeve

overcast
an unexpected
visitor

a play within a play
the dog finds
an old toy

prickly dilemma
a spider
scales the cactus

pop-up
the catcher’s mask
goes flying

white privilege
the state trooper
waves me through

sunset
another call
gone to voicemail

city lights
the glitter
of broken glass

interrupting my dream
one question
too many

spring sleet
he hisses
through clenched teeth

opening day
fresh mustard
on my brand new sweatshirt

dreams of a vagabond
marching to the gallows
with his head held high

overcast
a catbird
in the dogwood tree

a gift
from my ancestors
high blood pressure

three days before pay day
credit cards and lint
in my wallet

april overcast
describing my pay increase
as symbolic

arriving at my destination
i lose myself
in a song

approaching clouds
does she know i dreamed
about her last night?

restless night
the two-headed snake
of my dreams

in the desert
a cinder block shrine
to madness

writer’s block
the tree branches
still bare

a hard question
do i or do i not
possess hard skills?

an empty beer can shrine
in the dry river bed
of my dreams

raw spring night
wondering what the moon
sees in me

white gardenias
betrayal
takes two

in the still of night
his duet
with a ghost

up the narrow stairwell
her cheap perfume

spilling a beer
he mumbles about
his messy divorce

loud restaurant
the grandchildren
right at home

avoiding the sweep
the closer’s
filthy slider

restless night
a new creak
in the headboard

quarter moon
my granddaughters
hold hands

waiting for
this unreal reality show
to end

spring cleaning
the town tears down
a makeshift memorial

loitering
in the hotel lobby
this fear of emptiness

soft music
when i’ve stayed
too long

off night
unable to find
the remote

sweet dreams
his beautiful torment

half moon
watching
the pendulum swing

starlight
when she says she’d rather
drink alone

perfect tone
the trumpet player’s
empty tip jar

summer cloudburst
an impromptu waterfall
down the subway steps

tamale truck
the bright spot
of my day

the baker’s smile
a non-repeating constant

wrong turn
on the road
less traveled

bone of contention
a birthday party
for our dog

dog party
biting the tail
of the donkey

after the rain
ripples
in the arroyo

late lunch
chasing after
the tamale truck

laying the wreath
the din
of a distant siren

in the display window
a mannequin’s shame

crowded cafe
the barrista misspells
my name

hoping she enjoys her book
as much as i do

his first game
not a cloud
in the sky

cicadas
the lines
on my face

dusk
a vapor trail
in the sky

old-timer’s game
18 shades
of gray

an errant frisbee
the trees erupt
with sparrows

wild flowers
she calls me
a silly grandpa

marathon eve
i carbo-load
in sympathy

the caption beside her selfie
cause of death
not yet determined

inconveniencing everyone
a tourist’s selfie

blaring from loudspeakers
pre-recorded church bells

i was a pacifist
and then
that tank top

stopping traffic
her long, long legs

crowded subway car
the girl on my right
swiping left

marathon monday
the dog chases a rabbit
under the fence

crossing the finish line
ahead of schedule
a little girl’s balloon

close call
my ever increasing
blind spot

telling
a twisted tale
the mesquite tree

posing at the finish line
in the finest
designer running gear

twilight
wondering what the firefly
is trying to tell me

ready to burst
i tear off
her blouse

marathon monday
everyone wants to pet
the bomb-sniffing dog

rescued from the rubble
a muddy soccer ball

racing for the train
the words
trail behind

warming trend
the season’s
first tank top

town landfill
a worker
dusts off superman

on the nod
the sentence i started
hours ago

never out of fashion
grandma’s
barbie doll clothes

remembering when
that vacant lot
was an enchanted forest

to be young again
the wonder
of rain

death of a prince
a perfect
purple azalea

writer’s block
the haze
of an unfiltered ale

pink moon
a no-hitter
on the road

pink moon
the rhythm
of silence

overcast
her disappearing world

earth day
my grandchildren play
in the dirt

long story short
his long stories
are never short

northern lights
my new england
winter tan

intermittent showers
i finish
my father’s sentence

weekday hangover
rolling a beer keg
into the pub

after the rain
my mother forgets
who i am

over hard-boiled eggs
the old tales
grow taller

light rain
i tell myself
not to argue

steady rain
my mother’s
unsteady gait

light rain
the little lies
we tell ourselves

dogwood blossoms
my granddaughter
finds mommy’ make-up

bases loaded
a field full
of dandelions

under the white birches
another promise broken

vacation nearly over
the last
of the reposado

pink moon
a taste
of what comes next

morning sunshine
a red rose
among the weeds

cloudless sky
pretending
to listen

recycled
my father’s
war stories

her smile
a wild red rose
among weeds

a dream about the ex
a sense
of entitlement

friend request
she tells me she once had
a crush on me

waiting impatiently
my mother’s wheelchair

spring head cold
i forget
my password

vapor trail
forgetting i already wrote
this haiku

stormy monday
what awaits me
back at work?

special forces
the kind
that draw us in

the illegals!
my grandfather’s
thick accent

customer support reassures me
that my words are in the cloud

today, as always
basing my decisions
on indecisive clouds

littering
the pristine sea
man o’ war

he wandered
off the path
cold steady rain

cold spring rain
where i buried
the puppies

turning off the news
i put another log
on the fire

turning off the news
another log
on the fire

tearing down
my childhood
gentrification

starless night
my favorite pub loses
its liquor license

despite rubbing me
the wrong way she also
rubs me the right way

strategic planning
a flickering candle

signs of spring
my winter waistline

election forecast
cloudy with a chance
of dismay

neatly displayed
the wall
we tore down

in the hollow shell
of a battleship
birds make their nests

delicious
a strawberry
between your lips

indescribably delicious
the breakfast
i skip

from a windowless room
the ocean view
on my screensaver

scars in the sky
a military flyover

dissolving
into overcast
dusk

bottom of the ninth
cheap wine
down the drain

happy hour
all the blank faces
watching tv

explaining to the grandchildren
what off the hook
used to mean

writer’s block
dusk dissolves
into overcast

laughter
from above
mockingbird

may day!
the dog chases the cat
up a tree

her sad eyes
watching my smile
disappear

small talk
at the town dump
a flock of seagulls

high noon
the fragrance of weed
behind the dumpster

always on time
unattended church bells

signs of spring
a long line
at the kissing booth

may day
rivals meet
at the dog park

may day!
the furnace
turns on

no longer a little girl
the darling buds of may

raindrops glistening
on the darling buds
of may

may day!
we’ve run out
of firewood

spring chill
i hear my name spoken
in the past tense

signs of spring
schoolgirls
and their new crushes

back to work
the shadows fade
into overcast

invisible on radar
the lingering mist
between us

invisible on radar
the lingering mist

stationary front
the same haiku
i wrote yesterday

mouse droppings
we are
not alone

spring rain
and here i thought
we had something

spring rain
and here i thought
we were friends

spring rain
referring to my co-workers
as kids

more proof
the race isn’t won
by the swift

overcast
i draw
a blank

months later
i’m comforted to know
the cobwebs haven’t moved

somewhere
beyond these walls
the missing word

today’s forecast
obscure
with a chance of ennui

in the waiting room
i practice
my most sincere smile

today’s weather
overcast
with no chance at all

daylilies
my granddaughter’s
silly laugh

noisy crows
our new neighbors
put up a fence

earth day
paw prints
on the living room carpet

fragment of a dream
the ghost ship
on still waters

real blues
an out-of-tune guitar

these wordless thoughts
lost
in the mist

america’s pastime
her low-cut
baseball jersey

silent night
the rookie stares
at strike three

indigo sky
a text message
meant for someone else

indigo
the writing
on the wall

the candidate’s speech
a vulture perches
on a low-hanging branch

starry night
the heartbeat
in my head

lost in the big city
the homesick cowboy blues

hermit crab
longing for a place
to call home

witching hour
an invitation to cocktails
and surprises

downsizing
not the kind of closure
i expected

overcast
a night
without dreams

pondering my choices
a freshly killed bird
on the porch

over takeout
the reliever’s
nasty slider

after takeout
we recycle
our fortunes

crowded train
the former bartender
gushing about god

the town dump
high school students
selling tins of popcorn

called strike three
the arc
of a thrown helmet

derby day
the gallery
of silly hats

realizing
the rain
has no mother

arch-enemies
sitting patiently
for a milk bone

scattered clouds
i finish
my mother’s sentence

warming trend
remembering
what legs looked like

the clamor of flip-flops
my granddaughters show off
their pedicures

windows open
the dog barks
at the wind

days after
the argument
frost advisory

frost advisory
her new
hair color

morning meditation
someone’s
death metal ringtone

cheap perfume
and here i thought
we were alone

interrupting
my daydream
a giant pothole

back to work
pushing on a door
labeled pull

forgetting my dream
mercury crossing
in front of the sun

speed trap
an unfamiliar
stretch of road

transit of mercury
i drink alone

she comes at night
the bullet
with angel wings

empty cafe
the shadows
wait tables

seeing right through
the politician’s call
for transparency

behind the sheer curtain
a face
staring back at me

seeing right through me
her translucent sun dress

today’s weather
hot
with a chance
of sun dress

spring sunset
my five-o’clock shadow
running late

holding my breath
the dog too curious
about the bee

quitting time
the mad rush
into gridlock

cloudless sky
i draw
a blank

all dressed up
the flamboyant tree

between a rock
and a hard place
an empty bus

hazy sunshine
the blank expression
on my face

beyond a bamboo fence
two hungry eyes
unblinking

friday the thirteenth
the crow’s feet
on my face

a break in the clouds
i search for
an alibi

punta lobos
the salty language
of the fishermen

unrolling
a pair of yoga mats
for the dog

threatening skies
a cacophony
of songbirds

overcast
trying to remember
the last time i dreamed

searing heat
the shade
of a fire tree

across the street
a man with a zoom lens
pointed at me

weekend gridlock
the exhaust fumes
of progress

dressed to kill
she stares
right through me

dinner running late
the wren sings
cheeseburger

clear skies
a shower
of tree pollen

thunder clouds
he tells me how many days
he’s been sober

mr. natural
stirring his yogurt
with a plastic spoon

an old lady tells me
the meanest dogs
don’t bark

outside old trafford
the children cheer
a bomb-sniffing dog

lost in the city
the gps
recalculates

on hold
and increasingly more suspicious
of my suspicious activity

big sky
miles and miles
of miles

sleeping beneath
the palapa
my seaborne dreams

writer’s block
row after row
of empty cubicles

under the bridge
the nervous chatter
of pigeons

cringing at the thought
i cleanse my palate
with wine

spring at last
the girl next door
blossoms

with each crashing wave
a part of me
dissolves

wounded sparrow
trapped
in someone’s nightmare

sleepless night
sometimes i wonder
what the flashing lights mean

muddy footprints
a fraudulent charge
on my credit card

in a quiet street puddle
my life
turned upside-down

dreaming
on the wrong side
of the tracks

gibbous moon
contemplating
the third rail

in the rescue mission
a new mother sings
golden slumber

election season
so many weeds
among words

in a windowless room
daydreams
of dogwood blossoms

moving day
freshly splattered paint
dots the worn carpet

in the waiting room
an uninformative
infomercial

watering
the plastic plants
a broken sprinkler

washing in
with the tide
the missing word

abducted
by the wind
my umbrella

pockets empty
the beachcomber finds
a sand dollar

light rain
she begins
her maternity leave

studying
the ambivalence
of her gray eyes

so very young
and so in love
with the rain

it’s not news
that the news
isn’t truth

fiddleheads
the sound
of bluegrass

chess match
in the park
my checkered past

dangling from the old tree
memories of my childhood

milk moon
unbuttoning
her blouse

gibbous moon
dispelling
the layoff rumors

gibbous moon
her unfinished
tattoo

flower moon
my granddaughters’
bell bottoms

delta blues
a bead of sweat
on my beer bottle

the tequila labelled
for medicinal use only

wind-swept palms
dancing to music
only she can hear

dirty water
music
to my ears

writer’s block
fishing a bottle
from the trash

singing along
to a norteno ballad
fishermen mend their nets

radical chic
a sixty-dollar
che guevara t-shirt

tail wagging
while i steady the tripod
a three-legged dog

flower moon
i order another
jamaica margarita

fresh graffiti
reflected
in the flickering streetlight

not sure what quinoa is
i order it anyway

removed for safety reasons
a makeshift shrine
for the accident victim

guarding
the suburban lawn
a smiling buddha

sunset
the glare
in her eyes

a sip of mezcal
the smoke
in her eyes

plucking her eyebrows
she says
they’re only friends

writer’s block
white fades
into gray

flashing brake lights
the moment my life
went downhill

unstable air
the politician’s
posturing

blocking my ocean view
a castle
made of sand

interrupting
my tropical daydream
a mango falls

balmy sunshine
a shower
of bug repellent

bitter and opaque
this home-brewed ipa
and me

restless night
the glow
of the cat’s eyes

reflecting
all the words
i’ve forgotten

all this fuss
for a shady place
in the sun

walking on water
ripples
in the lagoon

warming trend
her tight white
tank top

beaten down
by wind and wave
somebody’s dream

smog moon
stop telling me
to calm down

daydreaming
to the rhythm
of her hips

morning haze
the aftertaste
of a broken promise

just when i thought
the sun had set
fireflies

warming trend
the right
to bear arms

butterflies
staring
at a knuckleball

writer’s block
killing another
mosquito

tequila
says my spirit guide

too naive
to plan ahead
turtle hatchlings

unable to resist
i count
chickens’ eggs

air quality alert
one ethnic joke
too many

rough road ahead
that sickening sense
we were all wrong

what i wish
you wouldn’t tell me
in the cool of night

restless night
a wobbly
ceiling fan

longing
to touch your face
the summer breeze

that queasy feeling
knowing who will lead
a nation of fools

nearly wishing
my late friend
a happy birthday

no time for bravery
the dog corners
a chipmunk

picking through my trash
boy scouts
in search of contraband

unafraid to admit
i’m in love
with that song

tough loss
a new baseball
down the storm drain

lingering heat
an extra habanero

my baseball fantasy
her high and tight
tube top

right on time
the wrong train

reading her obituary
the one i still remember
in pigtails

my only dress shirt
never looked so good
when i wore it

remembering
all the sales
they died for

believing
without seeing
is blindness

the boys of summer
always chasing
the girls of spring

cracking the code
a fawn eats
from my hand

approaching front
the dog barks
at nothing

memorial day
the history
we choose to forget

summer’s end
together
we drink alone

missing
the stars
tonight

that mountaintop
where our love
used to be

sad song
all i see
is the night

flowers
surround the casket
the why of it all

memorial day rain
so i’m not
the only one

rush hour
the turtle that didn’t make it
across the road

after the rain
a flower
in her hair

honoring those who’ve served
by wearing camouflage
in front of the tv

the ultimate sacrifice
i let her have
the last beer

climate change
i express
an opinion

climate change
expressing
an opinion

long weekend over
let the requiem
begin

clean-shaven
i bite into
a peach

finding tonight’s dream
in the baja sky

the look on this city boy’s face
when she asks me
to adjust the bridle

pale sky
the decision
to wear shorts to work

daybreak
the glare
of my neighbor’s binoculars

friend or foe?
the dog’s tail
stops wagging

remembering
the idyllic childhood
i never had

just starting to blossom
the shrinking violet

pale sky
where this morning’s dreams
disappeared

finally summer
a tangle
of wild raspberries

bases loaded
tobacco juice
in a water bottle

amber sky
another drinking buddy
on the wagon

overcast
entering another shade
of gray

city diner
the cowboy explains
what a flapjack is

late for work
the state trooper
keeps calling me sir

cheering
the routine ground ball
through his legs

the crowd cheers
a routine ground ball
through his legs

in my dreams
all directions include
a mango tree

at full gallop
a riderless horse
on the beach

enlightenment
the dog stops chasing
the bumblebee

lonely highway
a phone call
from private number

evening clouds
unable to find
the strike zone

rock, paper, scissors
who’s going to tell them
about love?

lonely beach
a horseshoe crab
turned upside-down

almost summer
the question
of wine and beer

in the heat of night
slapping
the invisible sand fleas

almost summer
the softness
of a dog’s ear

softness
a dog’s ear

the irritating man
buys a scratch ticket

friend request
from a new age cliche

hearing yesterday’s rain
in the arroyo

restless night
the cat’s
green eyes

june drizzle
swirls of pollen
in the street

june drizzle
the home team’s bats
grow cold

summer wind
the bloom
off the rose

trying to remember
when it wasn’t raining

summer rain
i tell my parents
we won’t be visiting

class reunion
minus
the class

in the ballfield
of my youth
rabbits build a nest

distracted
by squirrels
her lover’s eyes

wanting a mission
all of the sins
i hold dear

visualizing world peace
i miss my exit

in the rubble
of my childhood home
wild flowers

together at last
the loneliness
between us

across the table
our shadows
join the silence

languishing
inches above my head
a pop culture reference

waxing moon
a twinkle in the eye
of the girl next door

waxing moon
the twinkle
in her eye

sunrise
the dog’s head
on my pillow

sleeveless
her full-sleeve
tattoo

pop-up shower
a groundhog returns
to its burrow

clouds without rain
another empty
campaign promise

after the argument
the cat sleeps
undisturbed

election night
crows fighting
over roadkill

muddling berries
for an impromptu cocktail

filling my prescription
the sound
of the ocean

writer’s block
breaking up
the fallow ground

magnolia blossoms
the neighborhood tomboy’s
prom dress

following the gps
down a street marked
do not enter

bowing to the rain
white peonies

a ringing payphone
in the desert
of my dreams

staring
at a broken payphone
with empty pockets

restless night
your angry words
in the wind

if these walls could talk
the neighbors
hurry by

overcast
the sound
of summer stillness

an amber sky
so bright i could taste it

cactus flower
everywhere
i’m not

startled from sleep
the dog growls
at the moon

fair-weather clouds
a cold beer cascades
into a pint glass

flowing between
her bare shoulders
a dandelion tattoo

running an errand
the next-door neighboor
sneaks a cigarette

my missing credit card
a bookmark
in her bible

light rain
mother rabbit
tends her nest

barely skimming the surface
cormorant

wondering
what that training bra
has taught her

summer wind
chasing the flies
from roadkill

heavy sigh
my grandson points
a toy gun at me

summer breeze
a day
without edges

wishing
i could tweet
the madness away

far from the city
the star i named
after you

ominous clouds
the politics
of fear

rush hour
the turtle
that didn’t make it

in chemistry lab
a visitation
from distilled spirits

tired of sad news
i play
a sad song

summer breeze
knowing our words
mean nothing

in a dream
he introduces his husband
and no one cares

crescent moon
she curls up
next to me

shapeless clouds
everything
we accomplished today

another meeting
swallowing
my cold coffee

steadying the telescope
my thoughts turn
to the stars

flag day
the peonies
at half-mast

swarming in the conference room
fruit flies
and engineers

when i have no words
but can’t remain silent

out of tune
the sax player’s
empty tip jar

calculating my net worth
the fisherman’s
gold tooth

under construction
my next headache

bittersweet
climbing
the walls

runaway train
everything
i’ve left behind

months after surgery
almost remembering
where the pain was

floating away
the pitcher’s
knuckleball

floating away
the knuckleball pitcher’s
lead

now leasing
my elementary school

the exhaustion i feel
not going to the gym

hazy sunshine
i explain what i do
for a living

hazy sunshine
explaining what i do
for a living

cleaning up
the science experiment
in the refrigerator

serenading
my hangover
a mourning dove

fighting
with words
about guns

strawberry moon
the bartender
calls mesweet

escaping the heat
i order
a habanero margarita

his pitching debut
ragweed
in bloom

strawberry moon
discovering another
freckle to kiss

summer morning
do the songbirds not care
that i’ve hardly slept?

summer weekend
the smell
of my bare feet

casting a shadow
the growing pile of clothes
that no longer fit

morning afterglow
the wisp
of a smile

summer solstice
how much daylight
can one man stand?

grandpa thinks
is the skylark
really happy?

father’s day
will he be the father
i wasn’t?

ferry landing
a restless seagull
in the sun

always too early
a cacophony
of church bells

ferry landing
so begins
the long goodbye

ferry landing
the long goodbye

burnt coffee
a city
no one wants

abandoned at the dock
a rusty tugboat

boardwalk attractions
the tattooed lady
pushing a stroller

father’s day
wondering how many
neckties i own

entering the harbor
the bitter old man
i’ve become

thickening fog
her long island accent

on the upper deck
faded instructions
on the life rafts

the faded instructions
on the life rafts

catching my breath
i lose sight
of the shore

high mass
nobody’s
getting high

hoisting anchor
the long journey
between shores

wondering when
you only die once
became an endorsement

first day of summer
the face of a glacier
breaks free

strawberry moon
the ribbon
in my granddaughter’s hair

summer solstice
wondering why we didn’t talk
more often

summer sun
the glare
of new construction

first day of summer
my heartbeat
in my ears

welcoming me
to this ghost town
a ruined church

chasing fireflies
a knuckleball

summer solstice
bring on
the night

crossing the border
without a passport
great blue heron

broken clouds
the ceo calls me
by the wrong name

summer haze
nobody reads
my t-shirt

we used to swim here
i tell my grandchildren
pointing to the parking lot

the second amendment
bookmark in his bible

staring at the clouds
all the things
i could have been

empty ferris wheel
the last time
we kissed

hours after surgery
the cold steel
of a walker

the politician’s speech
watching kudzu grow

floating
an unfinished dream

a waking dream
gone before
i could say goodbye

waiting for me
an empty train

shameless
i raise a toast
to shame

lost and found
all of the umbrellas
look like mine

dockside
leaving
for the last time

taking the plunge
a cormorant
and the dow

soaking up the sun
the weathered shingles
of a beach house

after the brexit
an american beer
at an irish pub

crowded restaurant
the busboy’s
anxious eyes

weekend getaway
all the discomforts
of home

no escape
the other side
of the bridge

sea breeze
and suddenly
a songbird

if there’s anything i can do
she says
insincerely

sea breeze
how i long
to feel it

surf drive beach
a lifeguard
and his smartphone

dining al fresco
enumerating
her dietary restrictions

in the empty pages
of my notebook
a lilac petal

seeking shade
my bloodshot eyes

the comfort
of my rocking chair
as joggers pass me by

ocean view
the old dog
on a leash

biker couple
covering their tattoos
with sunscreen

camp meeting tabernacle
a violin sonata
for crows

old money
the taste
of gingerbread

chappaquiddick
two ships passing
in broad daylight

spring sunset
a may-december romance
in bloom

her phone number!
all the pens
out of ink

political rally
discovering
america

letting the breeze
just happen
spider web

end of the weekend
the suv packed
with memories

bottle that breeze
he says to the wine glass

heat wave
a melt-down
on wall street

craving a stiff drink
an x-ray
of my spine

haiku moment
my muse
licks my nose

summer rain
measuring out
cold cereal

secret service agents
in plain sight

moving day
my granddaughter asks her mother
why she’s crying

writer’s block
with a chance
of thunder

rain delay
the hot dog vendor
out of mustard

young love
naming
the stars

young love
daylilies
in bloom

reflected
in a street puddle
broken clouds

returning from a road trip
into withering heat

no reason
why the orange man
is yelling

cloudless morning
the poet’s
blank screen

rising above
the projects
the same crescent moon

leaving me
the ones
i left behind

riveting
the spark
from a welder’s torch

broken clouds
the neat and tidy home
in foreclosure

june swoon
the rookie’s fastball
slows down

when the apple forgets
to fall from the tree

what i didn’t know
dark night
of the soul

beneath the war monument
the slap
of a skateboard

play ball!
the unending summer
of my dreams

beyond the sea wall
the whispers
of ghosts

thunder without rain
the slugger swings
at strike three

thunderstorm
a late-night
visitor

dusk
the dog
discovers fireflies

restless night
the dog barks
at thunder

a new day
finally old enough
to take baby aspirin

business as usual
the door to the boardroom
closed

back to the gym
a broken punching bag

holiday weekend
a cloudless sky

the smile i wore
in an old photograph

the silence
when i mispronounce
uber

holiday spirit
the red, white and blue
of an ambulance

elevated fire potential
her long red hair

an unforgiving sun
where the shade tree
used to be

explaining to my granddaughter
how the cocoon
becomes a butterfly

wondering what she dreams about
when i dream
about her

in the attic
the cuckoo clock
of my childhood

independence day
my 24 year-old son
moves in

independence day
the dog sleeps
between us

impenetrable haze
the other side
of the bridge

low tide
the glitter
of sea glass

fireworks
she tosses me
her panties

assuming
the position
a lotus

summer rain
a dream that ends
with a kiss

overcast
not quite
a mona lisa smile

the sound of footsteps
in my secret place

clenched in tantrum
the candidate’s
tiny fists

opening my window
the songbirds
grow quiet

crescent moon
what we lost
in the fire

all my regrets
asleep
on the couch

tomorrow’s news
the lizard
sheds its tail

thunderstorm warning
the clamor
of landscapers

under the bridge
with a laptop
internet troll

wondering if she knows
i dreamed about her
last night

the old dock
wondering who the gulls
are waiting for

private beach
leaving her
innocence behind

the face of war
a red squirrel
in the tomato patch

seething
i google
red squirrel recipes

negative space
the photographer’s
dark studio

overcast night
the mouse trap
snaps

overcast morning
talking heads
in unison

meanwhile an egret
in the reflecting pool

time warp
someone calls me
a silver fox

cool summer night
we keep
the windows open

pulling away from shore
the curvature
of my spine

dark skies
an empty seat
at the card table

mispronouncing my name
she tells me
my opinion matters

on the back
of a losing lottery ticket
my next haiku

flirting
with the idea
of flirting

daylilies
the cruel flirt

crescent moon
her backlit
silhouette

fighting through the crowds
to find
my own special place

the dog’s
favorite place
between us

summer rain
the garden gnome’s
weary smile

uninvited guest
a chipmunk
in the garden

a dream
unable to find
the words

chance of rain
the princess
kisses a toad

requiem for a weekend
a cocktail
for one

visualizing world peace
the gps
recalculates

broken clouds
he gives
two weeks notice

broken clouds
his two weeks notice

looking for a change
the vending machine
eats my dollar

under construction
another empty
office building

crowded elevator
the rise
of second-hand smoke

cloudless sky
so many deals
on what i don’t need

waiting for the food truck
a double helping
of gossip

cloudless sky
my grandson’s eyes

mass over volume
a dyslexic’s destiny

quarter moon
i park
at a broken meter

searching for pokemon
i miss
a shooting star

summer heat
the dog attacks
a lawn sprinkler

looking through the crystal ball
i see my other hand

determining
today’s top priority
hummingbird

rush hour
the busker’s
broken string

summer drought
with no sign
of pitching

summer heat
i salute
her stars and stripes bikini

crime scene
presidential candidates
on the campaign trail

unstable air
they’re all young enough
to be my children

in the headlines
wild turkeys
in traffic

morning gridlock
thursday’s child
has far to go

cloudy skies
an unexpected
dinner guest

darkening sky
the subject changes
to politics

threatening sky
the hum
of a power line

lights, sirens
rush hour gridlock
unmoved

remembering to recycle
my losing lottery tickets

tired eyes
where the sun
never sets

summer rain
the street busker
goes underground

summer heat
following a bead of sweat
to paradise

chappaquiddick
the ferries
exchange places

celebrating
our healthy diet
i gain
half a pound

always on time
the dog’s
exuberant greeting

scattered clouds
with a chance
of ennui

blue skies
only the news
we want to read

not taking any chances
i buy a powerball ticket

down to business
the new prime minister’s
pearl necklace

last of the tomatoes
the squirrel’s
sinister tail

no pokemon here
but you do have
a green light

beating traffic
the road
not taken

lost
in her bedroom eyes
everything

nautilus shell
following
the spiral inward

point and click
in search of
the perfect word

hot morning sun
the deafening hush
of locusts

shots ring
into the angry night

her impressive list
of food allergies
makes me hungry

gibbous moon
the weekend’s
last beer

a bridge too far
tourists pose
for selfies

cheap wine
i toast
a world gone mad

starlight
the eyes of lovers
in a world gone mad

starlight
the eyes
of lovers

working remotely
the dog barks
at my boss

severe weather advisory
the convention begins

after the rain
a cloud
of gnats

above the din of traffic
sparrows splashing
in a mud puddle

on a hunch
i take
the wrong way home

sunrise
the glitter
of broken glass

fair-weather clouds
my son helps
with the dishes

thunder moon
cattle dogs
at play

glaring into the sun
another empty
office building

the old cottage
i leave the cobwebs
in place

buck moon
my son searches
for apartments

pepper blossoms
the heat wave
breaks

hay moon
the farmer’s daughter
in heels

summer fog
my mother hands the phone
to my father

dusk
pointing to a spot
on the x-ray

crickets
a bounced email

tiger lilies
coming home
in a bad mood

thunder moon
both benches warned

tossing and turning
all night long
gentle ocean waves

scattered clouds
the wrong week
to give up coffee

dive bar
the taste of lipstick
on my shot glass

the enlightened man
wearing lipstick
on his collar

hail warning
he accepts
his party’s nomination

hazy sunshine
the aftertaste
of one beer too many

heat wave
bittersweet
climbing the wall

summer gridlock
the weekend rush
to anywhere else

starless night
the deep croak
of a bullfrog

blustery night
the politician’s
quivering teleprompter

summer morning
the grind
of a tired engine

meanwhile
in my nightmares
a fiery crash

saturday morning
the construction projects
in my head

on the battered pier
old men
fishing for ghosts

a wild ride
your unbrushed hair

feeding the toy elephant
plastic peanuts

hugging her
oh so tight
that dress

ominous clouds
hoping the telephone
won’t ring

city lights
she dances
and dances

war memorial
i salute
the town drunk

moving day
clutching the box of trinkets
grandpa gave her

its rent
always paid on time
the empty storage locker

a break in the weather
i change the channel

pigeons in the church balcony
celebrating high mass

pigeons
on the church roof
celebrating high mass

on the precipice
my retirement portfolio

lonely night
when there’s nothing left to say
about the moon

in the news
a cloud
shaped like a fist

wind storm
a downpour
of tree branches

writer’s block
gray
fades to gray

choking down
truck exhaust
my quiet desperation

the heat wave continues
she’s run out
of sundresses

on hold
a recording reminds me
how important i am

bad news
the wind
changes direction

light rain
the weight
of a sigh

waning moon
a game-ending
double play

waning moon
modifying
his dnr

back from the abyss
make mine
a double espresso

now operating
with expanded hours
morning traffic

barefoot on the beach
dancing
the hot sand dance

coney island boardwalk
all of us
walking alone

bus to edgartown
the glare
of a silver flask

the gold at the end
of the purple sunset

parked in the driveway
that song

unstable air
waiting for the weather
to break

believing his own hype
the candidate
no one believes

passing the carousel
a sudden craving
for hot dogs

an unlabeled bottle
grief stronger than moonshine

pay day
counting the checks
in my checkbook

light rain
she mutes her phone
and weeps

slow steady rain
his imminent departure
starts to sink in

the weather breaks
she adjusts
her shoulder strap

break in the weather
i co-sign a loan

a sympathy letter
addressed to
occupant

at-risk behavior
always keeping
my eyes open

friendly skies
a hacky sack
sails by

friendly skies
an assigned seat
for his guitar

long lines
short tempers
at the security checkpoint

explaining to grandpa
what a pokemon is

now boarding
the flight attendant’s
bored expression

cruising altitude
the babies’ screaming
levels off

summer rain
a housefly
caught in the curtains

locking the gate
the hospital guard’s
echoing whistle

wind in the garden
the hospice nurse’s
soothing tone

a sudden scramble
wondering what
code four means

i’m not in pain
he said
painfully

in a dream
the apology
i never gave

talking music
with my son
my ringing ears

weekend party exhibit a
a stain scrubbed clean

today’s weather
monday
all day

over cold breakfast
end-of-life options

shift change
the nurse
finally smiles

waning moon
his dnr bracelet

between shallow breaths
the tv screen
flickers

blue monday
the long slow goodbye

finally waking
from an impossible dream

starless night
the weight
of a sigh

keeping vigil
the morphine drip

cherry festival
no place to
spit out the pits

sunrise
the contours
of the hospital building

young love
the taste
of bubblegum

midnight
the contour
of her hips

grandpa starts the car
the girls
begin to pray

awaiting departure
his annoying ringtone

mango festival
i invent
a new cocktail

landlocked
the nicest people

as the jetway
pulls away
my final thoughts

my final thoughts
as the jetway
pulls away

another deep breath
another game
of solitaire

in his new home
the flags
of his new and old homelands

blue skies
the overcast
within

struggling to stand
the white picket fence
of my dreams

crescent moon
the pain
of moving on

the fishing boat docks
just short of the rainbow

sunrise
she takes
her top off

crescent moon
the dog’s eyes
at half-mast

denouement
she’s not on
the last ferry

shooting star
wondering what
she sees in him

stranded
in the wind battered lighthouse
of my dreams

cloudless sky
her sassy smile

summer traffic
the rush
to escape the rush

summer traffic
the rush
to escape
the rush

on an empty page
of my haiku notebook
a dead mosquito

as per his wishes
his facebook page
is gone

old flame
a sigh of relief
when the email bounces

endless summer
a surfboard
coffee table

eyes at half-mast
the end
of a long week

midnight silence
ringing in my ears

overcast
the burden
of carrying on

flash flood
remembering
hiroshima

the perfect view
sunset
in her hair

after the rain
a cloud
of mosquitoes

lonely night
picking at
the scab

a bead of sweat
with no place to go

how quickly
it drifts away
indigo sky

starless night
a call
i didn’t want to make

while the cop sleeps
a runner steals second
uncontested

after the bank merger
all my monthly fees
double

over tropical waters
a deepening depression

island parade
losing myself
in the steel drum

her last wish
the ebb and flow
of the ocean

canyon road
feeling like
an antique

my summer daydream
a month of sundays

wild wisteria
climbing the walls

climbing the walls
wild wisteria

shorter days
wondering where
the good wine went

someone mentions her name
an inning-ending double play

windy night
the quivering
streetlight

my second cup of coffee
the buzz
of the high-tension wire

approaching storm
the dog’s bite
worse than its bark

crescent moon
wondering when she learned
to smile like that

chicken-wing conspiracy
only drumsticks and thighs
are left

pale sky
my haiku submission
rejected via text

in a dark room
a misconstrued
text message

setting sun
everything i own
on the bus

leading me home
a trusty old greyhound

new construction
a hornet’s nest

always too soon
summer sunset

new construction
this fear
of emptiness

searching for the mute button
and he’s only a candidate

benches clear
a cute puppy
on the field

spinning his wheels
a frightened dog
at the vet

discussing mom
the subject turns
to painkillers

writer’s block
i push a door
marked pull

caught
in a spider web
morning dew

after the rain
the automatic sprinklers
turn on

after the rain
a meteor shower

lonely night
an abandoned lighthouse

the ghost ship
sailing past an
abandoned lighthouse

her whisper
when she says the word
suicide

hovering above
a swarm
of news helicopters

heat advisory
when she knows
everyone is looking

heat advisory
the radar guns
behind home plate

impromptu debate
the candidate
and a crying baby

walden pond
all parking lots
full

quarter moon
i lie about
how much i drink

hot night
a long line
at the taco truck

midnight
a smouldering
citronella candle

hot summer night
a late-inning meltdown

hot summer morning
sharing my breakfast
with ants

port elizabeth taxicab
i follow
the calypso

field of nightmares
a pop-up
lost in the lights

on the campaign trail
so much thunder
without rain

bacon in the pan
the dead
do rise

crowded train
the bright red glare
of her lipstick

writer’s block
this fear
of emptiness

between rain showers
the dog
chases a rabbit

after the storm
the sky and i

approaching storm
no time
for metaphors

late summer thunder
wondering what
i’ll dream about tonight

heat lightning
face to face
with a dragonfly

long night
what is and isn’t
a wrinkle

her lips
my favorite drug

in the morning stillness
a transformer explodes

out of work
the panguero fishes a bottle
from the trash

not far away
shirtless boys throwing stones
at soldiers

hummingbird
wondering where
the time went

escaping the heat
a dive bar
with no cell signal

monday morning
another revolution
around the sun

another saturday night
police in riot gear
take up positions

cactus flower
an unrequited crush

fair-weather clouds
she remembers my birthday
but not my name

full of wine
the meteor shower
happens without me

in period costume
the village blacksmith
sends a text

morning meditation
a procession
of slow-moving clouds

budget cut
another
blood drive

gibbous moon
breaking up
the no-hitter

red moon
seeing her
in a different light

summer haze
nobody notices
my t-shirt

dog days
the dog
doesn’t care for them

anti hipster shaving
against the grain

another year older
but never too old
to pop bubble wrap

sturgeon moon
still no craving
for caviar

the pastor’s sermon
i tweet
a clever rebuttal

smart phones
dumbing down
america

sermon on the mount
the search
for forbidden fruit

grain moon
my home brew described
as chewy

last days of summer
tuning a guitar
i can’t play

seaborne clouds
a bet
i can’t win

had she said hello
she would have had me
at hello

dry
but not very cool
the weather
and me

always punctual
disappointment

the cabbie’s conspiracy theories
driving me crazy

curious
about the hobo’s
retirement plan

a swarm of bees
the next-door neighbor
practises violin

recovering nicely
the one who said
it’s only a game

water ban
which is why
there is beer

no one has to ask them
to work all weekend
little black ants

buying another round
for all the ghosts at the bar

missing the exit
my inner child
throws a tantrum

muggy night
a friend
unfriends me

baja midnight
it’s only
beginning

death by tie-dye
the grateful dead
cover band

last call
a stray dog
on the dance floor

right after saying
i have no regrets
a ukulele

dockside
hoping the brass band
won’t play

a long day’s journey
into the taste of whiskey

on the distant horizon
a reminder of how far
i’ve yet to go

bringing me back to earth
a traveling horse fly

leaving port
the radio plays
brown eyed girl

not holding my breath
the lifeboat decorated
with duct tape

wind chimes
i forget
the question

while we sleep
the ants in our kitchen
feast on crumbs

not quite
hitting bottom
the ship’s anchor

lost for words
a day
without clouds

my wistful thoughts
drifting out to sea

drifting out to sea
my wistful thoughts

wondering
who’s on the other end
of that selfie

hurricane watch
fear
of a big inning

away from everything
my favorite parking spot

solitaire
when there’s no one else
to blame

end of summer
the weight
of my bucket list

blood-tinted soil
where the sugar plantation
used to be

a collective gasp
laying down
the perfect bunt

after the storm
a choir
of chain saws

under cloak of darkness
the outlaw
with a garden hose

remembering
the simple joy
of a summer breeze

waning gibbous
when the words
just won’t come

back to school
checking out the new moms
at the bus stop

after the storm
a chorus
of chain saws

the morning after
rolling an empty keg
out of the pub

late summer chill
my grandson won’t
come to the phone

my yearly check-up
a bitter pill
to swallow

furniture shopping
a flat finish
on wall street

august afternoon
a snake
in the road

page not found
my online bio

endless summer
four young girls
in bikinis

bullpen action
the pitcher’s
unfinished tattoo

a fisherman’s dream
when my ship
comes in

bottom of the ninth
a mosquito
goes down on strikes

a hurried kiss
the dog’s ear
twitches

pitcher’s duel
beware of
dangerous curves

forgetting
that i never liked
cotton candy

fever dream
the crows
calling my name

never straying
too far away
baja sunset

the notebook
a study
in emptiness

stirring my coffee
somebody asks me
what i am

wagging his tail
the slipper thief

tropical disturbance
this is no longer
a street party

muggy night
august goes out
with a whimper

slow song
a desolate stretch
of road

always a blur
the world
through beer goggles

fisherman’s gold
launching
into sunrise

the old dog
chasing rabbits
in his dreams

last days of summer
please wear that sundress
one more time

answering the question
i dare not ask
with a kiss

the tour bus arrives
an abandoned
mining town

jackhammer
keeping rhythm
in hell

pop-up shower
a prairie dog
retreats

reaching for my pillow
another dream
that i’m lost

same time as yesterday
the old clock tower

open air market
everything
i’ll never need

above the crowd noise
the awkwardness
of a first date

fair-weather clouds
the cart
before the horse

better than an autograph
pine tar
on my pen

now entering
the street musician’s concert hall
the 515 train

clinging to summer
a sale
on wool mittens

tempest in a teapot
my third cup
of coffee

writer’s block
water rationing
mandatory

waning crescent moon
time to amend
our wills

summer twilight
the instructions
for my ashes

a homeless man
conducting the orchestra
in his mind

last days of summer
all of the warnings
to slow down

waiting for the school bus
8 new backpacks
staring at cell phones

back to school
six backpacks
with legs

chased by the dog
a damselfly
in distress

the songs it sings
a busker’s
battered guitar

losing face
an old stack
of poker cards

summer chill
i don’t remember
being young

stuck behind the bus
on the second day of school

calm seas
the tugboat’s
tired flag

morning meditation
a ladybug
ascending

bottom of the ninth
knowing i should
know better

pale sky
what could
have been

fair-weather clouds
my musical taste
described as retro

mostly cloudy
my disposition

mostly cloudy
news of his death
six months ago

rural tourists
posing for selfies
with a cow

chance of thunder
loosening the top button
of her blouse

new moon
the emptiness
begins

empty nest
the unmistakable sound
of fall

embracing september
her cold cold touch

september call-ups
practicing
autographs

young love
the couple’s
matching yoga mats

purring at my feet
pythagoras
dreaming of triangles

clean slate
my mother
repeats herself

after the rain
the need
for rain

empty nest
i fill
our wine glasses

national anthem
where to put
my 8-dollar beer

new moon
the rhythm
of the darkness

clinging to summer
a morning
of sweatshirts and shorts

deadliest catch
her fishnet stockings

the verdict is in
summoned
for jury duty

holiday weekend
my first beer
the color of sunset

heaven
a taco truck
on every corner

what holiday?
a woodpecker
at work

summer haze
someone murmurs
alzheimer’s

head over heels
i trip over
my tongue

cooler days ahead
i contemplate
my unshaven face

cooler days ahead
my unshaven face

clinging to summer
red dragonfly

old enough
to know better
and yet

startled from sleep
what the dream catcher
didn’t catch

harvesting
our last tomato
damned chipmunk!

the bitter aftertaste
of dirty politics

neither rhythm nor rhyme
my two left feet

before the storm
a hurried harvest
of habaneros

hot summer night
a frozen rope
to center field

september chill
the first
golden leaf

writer’s block
a storm spinning
just offshore

holiday weekend
a red-tailed hawk
rides the breeze

refreshing my memory
the scent of thyme

labor day
the subject changes
to retirement

opening the good wine
i contemplate
my next renku link

storm damage
my umbrella
turned inside-out

at the end
of a long weekend
an empty beer bottle

gale-force winds
my brittle limbs

the end of summer
forgetting
i never liked whiskey

trading sighs
the last breath
of summer

september rain
the weekend dissolves
into coffee

wondering what i did wrong
to be selected for jury duty

in the jury room
all eyes
on the empty podium

awaiting further instructions
slow soaking rain

mystic cleaners
still can’t tell me
when my suit will be ready

overcast
the bailiff’s scowl

long night
she takes off
that short dress

manila morning
a shop owner sweeps
the cracked sidewalk

crescent moon
thinking i might be
overthinking it

no moon tonight
i choose
a bitter beer

restless night
a storm spinning
just offshore

rain chimes
my new
favorite song

after the storm
so many green leaves
on the ground

gingko walk
not trying to read too much
into the clouds

row after row
of memorials in
the healing garden

clinging to
a lost summer
the last tomato

late summer fog
reading between
the power lines

late summer fog
the weariness

beyond the pale
late summer fog

restless night
waves pounding
a rusted shipwreck

summer dusk
the dog twitches
in his sleep

clinging to summer
her tight blouse

climbing
the barbed wire fence
crescent moon

crowded train
the far away look
in our eyes

cold to the touch
grandpa’s stovepipe hat

thick with smoke
the lingering taste
of brisket

morning commute
rats flee
the oncoming train

clinging to summer
september sweat

doing the math
more zeroes
than i thought

leaving nothing to chance
i buy
a powerball ticket

the barking dog
chasing you away
from my dream

castaway
a house fly
along for the ride

sunshine
a broken fence
in our backyard

thunder
another dream
about the towers

falling from the sky
not the unique snowflake
i thought i was

lost in the pumpkin patch
an honest cup of coffee

lonely night
waiting for
my taco truck

emptying
my wine glass
her bare shoulders

kissing you
everywhere
and then some

september chill
the fear
of forgetting

silence
out goes
the distant light

reflected
in my monitor
my weariness

cloudless sky
her deep blue eyes

my opinion?
an acorn falls

cloudless sky
a child’s balloon
floats away

cloudless sky
a child’s balloon

not visible
on x-ray
the cloudless sky

choking down a slice of pizza
the parking meter expires

dirty laundry
my retirement portfolio
takes a bath

she asks for
my must-haves
the buoy’s rusty bell

september chill
the rookie reliever’s
hanging curve ball

called third strike
the sympathy
of crickets

all the cares of the world
dissolve
in a tummy rub

writer’s block
peeling a spider web
from my face

approaching the equinox
i slow down
to 55

the old cathedral
who can hear
my echo?

just for me
her sexy selfie

believing
it’s a cold front
when i feel it

crisp autumn night
all the words
i’ve lost

autumn chill
the vermilion sky

clouds on the horizon
struggling to find
the words

harvest moon
her updated
relationship status

harvest moon
the dog grabs a slipper
from the closet

gibbous moon
so many ways
to say goodbye

cold front
she fastens
another button

fall colors
the home team
takes a holiday

fall colors
the home team’s bats
take a holiday

cold front
the home team’s bats
take shelter

after the lunch crowd
the slow stagger
of a regular

writer’s block
following
a lead balloon

harvest moon
what’s left
of the tomatoes

harvest moon
another acorn falls

i’m a kid again
puppies chasing
soap bubbles

harvest moon
when the ambulance arrives
for you

harvest moon
the ambulance arrives

when the hospital hallways
become a bit too familiar

wondering if the dog
is jealous
of my cat scan

fitful sleep
fishers fighting
in the darkness

crowded cafe
two women argue
about pink noise

trying to
hold it together
the staples in my head

lacking incense
the smell of bacon
will do

also not
on my bucket list
a zip line

clouds without rain
the bitterness
of an empty six-pack

gray sky
setting the world
on six and seven

downplaying the victory
the finch’s
happy song

september rain
only the crows
complain

whistling in the rain
the school bus driver’s
last stop

in and out
of consciousness
an idling truck

sleeping in  or not
a sloppy kiss
from the dog

dreaming
that there was a levee
to break

pennant fever?
all of the empty seats
at camden yards

windless night
a mosquito lands
on the moon

midnight snack
the dog’s dinner

midnight snack
persuading the dog
to eat his dinner

gibbous moon
the wild flowers
black and white

troubled sleep
sparks
from a high-tension wire

late summer fog
my coffee
grows cold

last day of summer
just one more
sundress

peaceful waters
the fishermen
mend their nets

summer drought
the reservoir hits
rock bottom

that part of partly cloudy
that lingers all day

then i realized
that family in a pup tent
wasn’t camping

writer’s block
a reggae beat
fills the void

equinox
unconvinced
we’re even

only wednesday
absentmindedly squeezing
a stress ball

last day of summer
the fog gives way
to tear gas

always on time
always too soon
the first autumn leaf

in the exam room
the fingers of a rubber glove
pointing at me

last day of summer
the rookie’s
first home run

equinox
the pain
of moving on

first day of fall
the empty nest
upstairs

if they only knew
the sign reads
welcome fall

autumn chill
the late-night wail
of an ambulance

the fallow field
where we once
played war

shorter days
longer hem lines
my september sigh

seeking words of wisdom
in the chatter
of sparrows

pale sky
the moment my hair
turned white

resident parking only
the hip brownstone
of my dreams

pale amber sky
counting down
to oblivion

the ambulance lights
still shining
what i almost lost

september rain
believing in
magic numbers

more wine
or no more wine
the empty glass
doesn’t answer

hospital discharge instructions
one page
intentionally left blank

tonight’s weather
dark circles
under my eyes

seat belts fastened
one more week
in september

autumn dusk
even the sky
is pumpkin-flavored

autumn dusk
the pumpkin-flavored sky

nautilus shell
the spiral
inward

writers block
i divide
by zero

clenching my teeth
i keep telling myself
it’s only a game

frost advisory
the pain of remembering
the wrong thing

frost advisory
the pain
of remembering

monday
a freshly plowed field
covered with frost

debating
whether or not
to watch the debate

writer’s block
the brook
runneth nowhere

the last ferry
where to go
from here

off-season
the regulars know
i’m not a regular

off-season
now she gives me
the time of day

off-season
the drawbridge operator
gone for coffee

winning the debate
everyone
who didn’t watch

not open
to debate
a wailing siren

meanwhile
away from the camera
two rivers meet

september rain
a confluence
of sighs

magic number one
welcoming
nightfall

stomping out
his cigarette
the cardiologist

53rd and 3rd
the one
they never pick

clouding up
the cascade
of an unfiltered ale

long-range forecast
too many days
of clouds without rain

autumn overcast
shadows creep
into themselves

outside the er
a doctor hides
his cigarette

knowing
the wine won’t tell me
when i’m done

the cheap wine
when you’ve lost
and yet won

when the days grow colder
a recording
of my granddaughter’s laughter

disagreeing with the bartender
that i’ve had enough

now departing
what was left
of my patience

in a dream
the midnight stroll
we never took

overcast
starting to believe
it will never rain

overcast
will it ever
rain again?

slow steady rain
the doctor begins
as you get older

october rain
adjusting
my expectations

black dog day
remembering the one
that got away

black dog day
the one
that got away

fall foliage
her pink and purple
highlights

new moon
picturing ourselves
in another man’s dream

warm autumn day
that’s what i’ll call it
on the reservation

new moon
putting the
air conditioners away

new moon
the post-season
starting rotation

above the salt marsh
seagulls
in formation

under the bridge
dreaming
i’ve been here before

his final at-bat
a half-empty
beer bottle

a weekend road trip
into what’s next

after the rain
a friend request
from a stranger

the intricate beadwork
of the doll
she left behind

playing hide-and-seek
with the kids
the dog finds me

waking to a nightmare
where every flavor
is pumpkin spice

gazing into the marsh
i wonder what the reeds
are whispering

warming trend
if she stands
any closer

forbidden fruit
bidding me
to take a taste

dangerous winds
i turn off
the news

the old bridge
realizing it’s
our only way out

the old bridge
our only way out

ringing in my ears
the clamor
of night

stealing a smile
from the little rich boy
a flickering candle

swirling in the breeze
all the leaves
i finished raking

damp autumn morning
an unripe banana

autumn chill
emphasizing
that first step

gray day
another eyebrow hair
to pluck

these uncertain times
the dog just wants
a tummy rub

a stranger
invites me to like
her facebook page

hurricane watch
a tall tree
casting a shadow

hurricane watch
the tall tree’s shadow
over our house

two men arguing
over women’s choices
without irony

autumn overcast
watching the cook
ruin toast

morning meditation
trying not to
scratch that itch

slow-moving storm
an acorn falls

autumn wind
the chili peppers
shiver

autumn wind
the last chili pepper
shivers

autumn wind
the last
chili pepper

one beer later
his daughter’s transition
is complete

a vast windowless room
where no one cares
who i am

in his sleep
the dog running
who knows where

cloudless night
looking for a star
to wish on

autumn wind
in one ear
and out the other

october fog
the missing players
on the playoff roster

lost in the fog
those lazy days
of summer

dangerous storm
voters
reject peace

happy hour
strangers
compare scars

envying the dog
who doesn’t care
about baseball

today’s harvest
a shoe
from an open closet

at the dealership
how many non-dairy creamers
to enlightenment?

routine maintenance
the drone
of 24-hour news

in the waiting room
a recipe
for stone soup

dense fog
i disapprove
this message

ringing in my ears
the persistence
of nothingness

the perpetual surprise
of her drawn-on eyebrows

remembering
every contour
in black and white

waxing moon
the girl next door
moves on

locker room talk
i decide to
shower at home

awake far too late
all the stars
whose names
i’ve forgotten

nervously waiting
for the next breeze
autumn leaves

clinging
to a bare tree
the last apple

election coverage
dogs
rolling in mud

mostly cloudy
down two games
to none

still pond
the conversation i wish i had
with grandpa

dreams of summer
stirring a cocktail
with a plastic-tipped cigar

migrating geese
no one asks them
where they’re from

rain-out
another day
to dream away

preparing for the debate
the subject turns
to painkillers

baja sunrise
and then
i wake up

dreamless sleep
a wine glass
half empty

frost advisory
the pain
of forgetting

frost advisory
hoping the offense
warms up

cold front
winter comes
to fenway

bitter wine
the visiting team celebrates
at fenway

pale and worn
the warmth
of grandma’s quilt

autumn shadows
the temperature fades
on wall street

in and out of tune
the news helicopter’s
sympathetic vibration

killing frost
harvesting
the unripe tomatoes

same time as last year
explaining to the kids
where maize is from

wild ride on wall street
always afraid
to look down

wondering when
the least worst option
became an endorsement

revoking his endorsement
the dog
throws up

escalating scandals
two rats
race to the sewer

dismantling
the white picket fence
of my dreams

passing clouds
the ceo
steps down

town meeting
seagulls gather
at the landfill

reading between the lines
of a losing lottery ticket

breakfast of champions
a handful
of painkillers

freeze warning
forgetting
my next thought

amber sky
all i need to know
about autumn

autumn moonlight
the red streaks
in her hair

a nation
of immigrants
in fear
of immigrants

nighttime construction
the soundtrack
of my nightmare

long night
her short dress

nighttime construction
her sturdy hips

loving
the beautiful mess
we’ve made

scaring only
the puppy
cardboard scarecrow

greeting the last ferry
a flock
of hungry seagulls

off-season
the bartender
doesn’t look up
from her phone

a hearty lunch
harbor seals
performing for tourists

finding that place
everyone goes
to hide

dark harbor
noisy drunks
and their empty bars

moonshine wisdom
the blur
of clarity

hunter’s moon
she asks if i’ve found
what i needed

safe harbor
an old cradle
in the back of a pickup

safe harbor
a world
without secrets

bayside café
stray cats in love
with the chef

cape cod dreams
when my ship
comes in

autumn stillness
when you’re counting
the days

awaiting
the last ferry
another happy hour

high above
the crowded beach
an osprey nest

hunter’s moon
unable to find
the words

drifting away
in the beach shack
of my dreams

not subject to vote
beachfront property
returning to sea

a strong cocktail
because i can’t wait
to dream again

my cologne?
the ocean breeze

never questioning
the curves
of a sand dune

dogs on the beach
the realtor talks
comparables

now that we’re just friends
let me tell you about
my recent heartbreak

burning leaves
another claim
the election is rigged

staggering
into the twelve step meeting

autumn weather
reading between
the pine needles

rough day at work
the smell
of burning leaves

gathering acorns
before dawn
a plump squirrel

back to work
a colorful cap
on her bald head

then i realized
it was too late to stop
the leaves from falling

deep autumn
a row
of empty beach houses

unseasonably warm
my eyes unbutton
her blouse

a bonus pinball!
the coney island
of my dreams

the final debate
the last
of the wine

the final debate
wondering why
i’m here

refusing to concede
an old dog
and his bone

a dog’s life
just another
day in the sun

suburban traffic jam
singing along with
someone else’s radio

napping
wherever she wants
the old dog

deep sigh
planning
my next dream

company meeting
i wake up
in the dark

another six months
before being nagged
about flossing

reaping what i sow
a nasty glare
from the farmer’s daughter

autumn fog
the undecided voters

back to suburbia
imagining the traffic
is a crashing wave

flash of lightning
a mangled bicycle
at the curb

brisk autumn morning
i forget
to breathe

writer’s block
what the rain
taught me

when the scarecrow
is a cranky old woman

halloween approaching
the blind
drive ahead

boardwalk dream
all the quarters i’ve lost
in that pinball machine

wind advisory
the candidate mutters
under his breath

night moves
she puts on the lingerie
i’ll be taking off of her

early to bed
the crunch of legos
beneath my feet

autumn wind
watching it
fade away

autumn wind
how easy it is
to get carried away

sugar maple
stripped of dignity
by the wind

end of the weekend
splitting
the last beer

monday morning
waking up
to a sigh

wooly muffler
i thought you were crying
because you were happy

a good wine
where it
all begins

wishing on a star
the other side
of the bridge

bounty hunter
nothing he won’t do
for a dog treat

ever closer
to the flame
a black moth

bipartisan agreement
the election can’t be over
soon enough

my aching bones
drunk enough
to know better

cold snap
feeling so much older
than yesterday

fall classic
a wheelbarrow
full of leaves

mid-winter harvest
wilted lettuce
from the supermarket

continued cold
the jagged clatter
of a jackhammer

autumn deepens
the silence
of a barren field

so low in the sky
the winter sun
and me

cold rain
a declined
invitation

an american scandal
the cat self identifies
as black

muffling
the footsteps of ghosts
slow steady rain

what i think
when they tell me
i deserve
the chair

alarm clock
boarding up
the beach house

wilted flowers
she loves me not

not remembering
the nightmare
that killed me

our vacation cottage
trying to fit
it all in

in a dream
the rhythm
of the waves

tonight’s weather
dying into
each other’s arms

comfort food
the weight
of my eyelids

not how i imagined it
our romantic hayride
in the rain

indecisive
this weekend’s weather

autumn overcast
what i whispered
among the sand dunes

autumn overcast
a scoreless tie

pitcher’s duel
an unfinished
haiku

the cashier perplexed
when i help her
make change

on his day off
the city boy
stacking wood

overlooking the intersection
a heron
just being

warming trend
the fragrance
of curry

just like last year
more halloween candy
than we need

first frost
a box
of unmatched mittens

leaving the changing room
i feel
exactly the same

clearance sale
the receipt claims i saved
more than i spent

leaving the changing room
feeling exactly the same

unrequited crush
a dog on the other side
of the fence

my latest crush
in high definition

festival of lights
the insistent hum
of the marquee

devil’s night
24-hour
television news

veteran catcher
losing a pop fly
in the lights

off the bench
a mouthful
of tobacco

intentional walk
the constellations
in the sky

my halloween costume
just happy
to be here

halloween party
sharing a beer
with satan

moonless night
learning that
my friend has died

trick or treat
the dog answers the door
wearing fangs

trick or treat
she dims
the light

the new casino
a sand castle
at low tide

day of the dead
walking into
a strong perfume

day of the dead
or as i like to call it
tuesday

day of the innocents
the dog’s
guilty look

all saints’ day
haiku elvis
gets his wings

under the bridge
unwritten graffiti

crescent moon
my cobblestone dreams

so many words
lost
in the rain

holding the door for me
he says
keep in touch

all souls’ day
a clock
stopped at midnight

game seven
even the cheap champagne
will do

a slow, graceful decline
the s&amp;p 500
and me

all souls’ day
the dog barks
at ghosts

nighttime construction
her broad shoulders

early november
another shade
of overcast

an innocent fling
she has
his eyes

last of the wine
the waning moon

cactus flower
i didn’t realize
she knew my name

earning my vote
her sturdy constitution

november wind
105 days until
pitchers and catchers report

not decorations
the patches
on my jeans

baseball season over
a woodchuck returns
to its burrow

can he hear my thoughts?
black-tailed jackrabbit

first date
the irresistible urge
to fact-check
one another

november wind
a double espresso
kind of day

lost on me
this illusion
of gaining an hour

turning the clocks back
one more hour to wait
for the election
to be over

at the silent auction
i bid
against myself

autumn wind
the sound
of darkness

end of the date
that moment she says
make yourself comfortable

baja midnight
desert shadows
come out to play

forgetting the umbrella
the wrong part
of partly cloudy

seaside park
trying to look like
i belong here

shining above
the liquor store parking lot
suburban sunset

the salt marsh
seasoning my dreams

perfectionist nightmare
right on time
for the wrong train

the week’s weather
partly cloudy
with a chance
of armageddon

in today’s polls
the sand dunes
rise and fall

bipartisan support
her push-up bra

election forecasts
pinning the tail
on the donkey

election eve
driving home
in the dark

wall street rally
and still the spider
spins its web

the furnace kicks on
another screaming politician

shorter days
mom lets dad
answer the phone

penalty kick
i stop snoring

election day
moss clings
to a weathered tombstone

election day
a weathered tombstone

election day
a field mouse
with nowhere to hide

election day
all of the words
that rhyme with orange

my vote cast
another acorn falls

throwing shade
on good and bad alike
november sun

in the voting booth
my pen runs dry

in other news
a reminder to find
that ice scraper

in other news
a reminder
that there’s other news

autumn haze
rain streams down
a cracked window pane

first frost
taking down
the campaign signs

ominous skies
i block
a facebook friend

turning off the news
i remind myself
to breathe

supermoon
i remember
how small i am

clearing my head
i prepare
for rain

deep breaths
the doctor’s
cold stethoscope

autumn stillness
the dead deer’s
gentle eyes

autumn wind
the need to write about
something else

how it begins
the trees more bare
than yesterday

in the waiting room
i study
a plastic fern

remembering
when the clouds
were just clouds

meanwhile
a dog
and his tennis ball

in other news
the dog
wants to play

the only visitor
to his grave
wildflowers

beside the weathered tombstone
a broken hallelujah

at the bottom of the box
a snarl
of christmas lights

editorial oversight
an unfinished haiku
in my draft folder

when the light
at the end of the tunnel
is an mri

cold autumn wind
drunks and stray dogs
howl

supermoon
when we’re both
in the mood

barrel-aged whiskey
as a matter of a fact
i’m not okay

november darkness
not even the owl believes
the election results

learning
to crawl again
the town drunk

gibbous moon
still wondering
what he’s hiding

treasuring the moment
the dog finds a tennis ball
in a pile of leaves

revising our wills
a wave crashes
far away

dropping the ball
a hawk surveys
the backyard

waning moon
unwilling
to let it go

in the hollow stump
of the old tree
wild poppies bloom

warm autumn sunshine
reviewing
our irrevocable trusts

autumn night
wondering if it will ever
be light again

if i learn
nothing else
a stray cat in the sun

defying
the autumn gloom
red maple

and yet
so far away
supermoon

autumn overcast
when there’s nothing left to say
about the moon

supermoon
the dreams
i could dream tonight

beaver moon
the beautiful dam
flooding my basement

shots fired
trying to look
like everyone else

saying
you drink too much
the bartender
pours me another

maybe if i drink enough
it will all make sense

passing the buck
a nervous hunter

low tide
a block
of shuttered casinos

rain at last
soaking it
all in

emerging
from their hiding places
the internet trolls

november morning
leaf blowers
in unison

the horseshoe crab
a shell
of its former self

lunch hour
pigeons feast
on crumbs

lingering clouds
all the blank space
between the lines

strangers
following me
on twitter

it’s already moved on
the next wave

waning moon
and yet
those eyes

white-tailed deer
one can never be
too careful

broken bridges
the rocky path ahead

weekend forecast
a six-pack
or more

cold front
the chilling effect
of the news

tonight’s weather
overcast
with a chance
of metaphor

that moment you realize
it wasn’t just
a bad dream

in a dark place
the compass
fails me

rocks and salt
the lighthouse
at the end of the world

morning meditation
scratches
in the plexiglass

writing it down
before it disappears

urban gridlock
a horn drowned out
by hip-hop

dimmer than i remembered
the first star
i see tonight

broken elevator
opening
for no one

out of tears
i chop
an onion

autumn wind
so raw
i stop feeling

wandering wind
where will it
sleep tonight?

floating so peacefully
a portuguese man o’ war

clinging
until the last leaf
falls

one final bash
an empty shopping cart
in the street

the forecast
blustery conditions
for the next four years

not welcoming visitors
the old lighthouse

riptide
when words
fail me

pulling up lame
the old comic’s
punch lines

howling wind
a sudden craving
for whiskey

always sooner
than i expect
the winter jacket

contents marked fragile
the speed bump
we didn’t see

first snow
to dye or not to dye
my hair

high tide
seaweed
riding the waves

snow flurries
photos of my grandchildren
at play

a dusting of snow
she asks if i
color my hair

changes to our wills
the last leaves
stripped from the trees

writer’s block
a crack
in the inkwell

deepening darkness
the danger
of silence

not in the mood
i lose
the election

beaujolais
her delicate skin

still the devil
the devil
you know

in a tiny movie theater
with some of the seats
facing backwards

remembering
what the angels told me
beyond the tree line

enough garlic
to ward off
everything

continued cold
a friend
unfriends me

the wind howls
pitchers and catchers report
in 83 days

house sparrows
staying home
for thanksgiving

shucking another oyster
the sound of waves

simpler times
the clocks
running backwards

happier times
the embers
of a campfire

better times
the embers
of a campfire

the roaring crowd
the nervous pitcher hurls
a no-hitter

restless night
street dogs
in unison

fried oysters
because they’re probably not
served in heaven

snow fence
what’s holding
me back

the pond at night
and old man singing
to swans

longer than
the winter night
her legs

a quiet place
no one to talk me
off the ledge

thankful
for the memories
we didn’t share

thanksgiving hush
the wishbone
already broken

not celebrating thanksgiving
the office building’s
sprinkler system

a boat adrift
that faraway look
in your eyes

black friday
where would
jesus shop?

today’s top story
page not found

with leftover turkey
the reason
my candidate lost

black friday
selling me
the brooklyn bridge

black friday
check-out line
in the city of ghosts

preparing to leave
she asks
is that what you’re wearing?

freedom trail
closed until
further notice

morning fog
i contemplate
my legacy

death of a dictator
the ebb and flow
of the sea

a break in the fog
my daughter’s

street dog limping away
from my outstretched hand

sparrowhawk
we agree
not to disagree

the physical trainer
tells me
to take a hike

winter morning
the dog dreams
in black and white

shorter days
how little
i have to say

holiday spirit
cattails pushing through
the snow

reaching for daylight
a winter wonderland

waiting for me
the shell of what
i used to be

at the bottom of the hill
a mountain
of leaves

cyber monday
building a better
wireless mouse trap

trick or treat
the grim reaper
inspects his candy

stifling a yawn
the din
of rush hour traffic

after the planning meeting
i drive home
in the dark

restless night
the heat cycles on
and off

trying not to stare
she stares
at me

restless night
imagining the softness
of her breasts

toxic fog
tweet
after tweet

autumn wind
the secrets
i can’t keep

my thoughts exactly
a restless arroyo

holiday spirit
insisting
it’s christmas spirit

i’ve been here before
the lowrider’s
throbbing bass

in the crowded conference room
another game
of solitaire

indirectly observed
the dark matter
all around us

slow soaking rain
and the fear
it will never stop

late november
unfavorable omens
in the sky

in my spam folder
an email
from santa

in need of work
the employment office

with a plastic pail and shovel
the sandcastle
of my dreams

in the boondocks
the trees
have eyes

the sun so low
it might forget
to rise tomorrow

his eyes wide open
a mouse
in the trap

open-minded
to believing
in gravity

that moment you realize
there is
no inner circle

the road before me
where no direction
is mine

crowded elevator
i press the button
twice

beyond every horizon
another horizon

breakup sex
knowing we won’t
be friends

asking the yoga instructor
if her schedule
is flexible

my face when she asks me
if my people
like rice

her rugged fingers
buying another clay pot
i don’t need

december
i race
the darkness home

the gift
of her wearing
the lingerie
i gave her

suburbia
when you know
every pothole

crescent moon
the only car
in the parking lot

a clear shot
if i had
the nerve

before the first snow
spring training tickets

ten-alarm fire
a chili pepper
i didn’t expect

christmas music
the dog
nobody wants

a twist
in the arroyo
mesquite tree

december wind
my restless dreams

snow in the forecast
my granddaughter
turns ten

writer’s block
a broken light
on a dead end street

morning gridlock
a snail
crosses the patio

dreaming of sleep
the insomniac

skidding into
another word
for snow

writer’s block
trying to peel
an unripe banana

misplacing
my magic wand
i awaken

waxing moon
a failure
to communicate

old faithful
the dog
on my pillow

i know she’s only
being polite
and yet

black ice
the judge declares
a mistrial

ghost ship
the music
stops

the ghost in you
lost
at sea

waking from a nightmare
the snow
hasn’t melted

holiday party
i hold a table
for nobody

above it all
custom house tower

christmas party
the lingering threat
of karaoke

christmas party
the imminent threat
of karaoke

peace on earth
the drunk’s head
on my shoulder

christmas gridlock
i cut off
santa

over too many beers
a cost-benefit analysis

sick of vampire movies
i order
a bloody mary

oak moon
a sudden craving
for chardonnay

especially visible in darkness
the writing on the wall

every day
a day that will live
in infamy

wonderfully wild
her beautiful hair
when she doesn’t care

reality tv
living
in infamy

stirring her
artisanal yogurt
with a plastic spoon

spilled milk
scramble
the fighter jets

restless night
footprints
on the moon

the most wonderful time of the year
untangling the christmas lights

lost in space
the man who gave us
the moon

farmer’s market
a stray dog
shops for kindness

the day drags on
fishing trawlers
at dusk

the season’s first cold front
warming the hearts
of climate change deniers

the season’s first cold front
my credit card
declined

overcast night
the stars
are somewhere else

overcast
the stars
somewhere else

amazing grace
the tai-chi master’s
silent song

arguing politics
with a side
of russian dressing

hoping my luck will change
i recycle
someone else’s scratch ticket

just in time for christmas
the season’s
first cold front

flying the friendly skies
an airport pat-down

heavier
than i remembered
the christmas decorations

bitter cold
she doesn’t
recognize me

single-digit temperatures
i count my fingers
twice

karaoke bar
i order
a whiskey sour

snow in the forecast
a whole new
kind of quiet

snow in the forecast
telling her
it was just a kiss

first snow
the hush

divide by zero
the calculator
goes berserk

snow turns to rain
what became
of my winter wonderland?

dreams of summer
a child’s balloon disappears
into a sigh

let’s take a break
says the one
who’s moved on

trimming the tree
i’m not as trim
as i used to be

for those who want to know
yes, they’re laughing at us

gibbous moon
being
who you are

serenity
at the end
of my rope

gibbous moon
i don’t know
what i want

in the news
a child plays
with a yo-yo

long night moon
the distant freight train
of my dreams

yankee swap
i take home
a headache

hiding
behind clouds
cold moon

my mother asks
why i can’t write
a nice poem

cold front
my snow white hair

a crack in the mirror
it’s me
on both sides of it

pale winter sky
i turn off
the news

a crack in the mirror
it’s me
on both sides

cold moon
when i run out of coffee
too soon

fair-weather friend
telling me it can’t be
too cold to snow

wind chill advisory
unfriended by
an exlover

suddenly unsure
if i’ve ever seen
a real reindeer

the dog on my pillow
how soon
i’m replaced!

barely able
to lift its head
winter sun

winter bluster
a dog barks
at the wind

thumbing a ride
the local car mechanic

the wind howls
a descendant of wolves
asleep on the couch

restless night
the ever-growing mouse
in the attic

the cheap wine
when i’ve stayed
too long

her smile widens
when i ask
about bamboo chicken

winter chill
beauty
where i didn’t expect it

until i find the words
i’ll keep writing

it’s that time of year
i misspell
poinsettia

shorter days
not trusting
the sun

darkest nights
she hands me
an unlabeled elixir

better than gift wrap
and a bow
snow
on your birthday

after the storm
christmas music
in an empty mall

the tequila
like i am
anejo

shaking a tiny fist
the little rich boy
who never grew up

winking at us
in the dark
a broken streetlight

whistling through
the cactus needles
desert wind

black ice
all the world’s
a slippery slope

black ice
a slippery slope

that moment
when love fades
into words

clear skies
lost for words
again

it doesn’t care
if i’m there or not
winter surf

not giving me
the time of day
a broken watch

now a doorstop
the next book
on my reading list

overcast
just another fool
searching for stars

empty mall
a skip
in the christmas music

tired of bad news
i drink the good wine
too quickly

disrespecting the sabbath
a ladder backed woodpecker

continued cold
a seat
on the bench

vapor trail
remembering
my first love

winter solstice
it’s all downhill
from here

longest night
she’s not
tired either

darkest night
the wind whistles
at me

abandoned house
the dog’s eyes
never close

winter solstice
discovering
the affair

shortest day
signing
my life away

pagan rites
and hallowed hymns
the yule log

winter solstice
an unsigned
christmas card

mixed precipitation
exactly
what i asked for

mixed precipitation
he’s surprised
i still work here

sleigh bells
the dog waits patiently
for a treat

in my dreams
two lovers
beneath the stars

cutting the cord
how quickly
the ground approaches

recurring nightmare
the flashing lights
are coming for me

wildflowers
my granddaughter’s
bell bottoms

reminded once again
of the nastiness
of eggnog

early winter
a new
cold war

dive bar
a sad clown singing
for no one

cloudy skies
all of the
last-minute
christmas shoppers

two days before christmas
stuck in traffic
with no place to go

last call
too drunk
to get drunker

christmas rain
the dog doesn’t want
to play

christmas rain
100 nights
until opening day

christmas brunch
santa
takes my order

over christmas ham
the usual
family drama

lost on christmas
wise men
don’t seek directions

border town
jesus and mary
detained

christmas spirit
some assembly required

azure sky
if i could live
in a photograph

christmas morning
guessing which presents
grandpa wrapped

boxing day
receiving a package
that isn’t mine

lazy afternoon
the dog hiccups
in his sleep

over leftovers
an argument about
the causes of war

high on a shelf
the best books
i’ve never read

my gift
of trying a slice
of the fruitcake

how long
to pretend to ignore
the unattended suitcase

waning moon
too sad
to make love

death of a princess
the cold
winter night

just when i thought
the night was winding down
a ukulele

peeling paint
my bloodshot eyes

winter northeaster
bare tree limbs
in surrender

after the storm
i put an empty bird nest
back in the tree

pale sky
please don’t tell me
it was only a dream

buzzing in and out
of my nightmares
a winter fly

a difficult year
i steal a penny
from the fountain

into the clouds
a child’s balloon
disappears

winter overcast
an unattended cigarette
in the ashtray

please don’t ask
if things could get worse

wintry mix
a firm grip
on the handrail

ghost ranch
all the pretty horses
i can’t see

wintry mix
my mother pretends to know
who i am

suburbia
a midnight stroll
with lawn sprinklers

why so angry?
the howling wind

snow showers
another deadline
come and gone

dreaming i could fly
a sudden
snow shower

trying to fix me
my granddaughter
and her magic wand

new year’s eve
tomorrow’s resolutions
at the liquor store

watching the ball drop
next year’s hangovers

counting down to midnight
old acquaintances
never forget

midnight
no one to kiss
but the dog

midnight
and no one
to kiss

new year
the countdown
to oblivion

times square
waiting for the other shoe
to drop

new year’s day
my first resolution
fast asleep

new year’s day
the ice in the backyard
still frozen

burning on the stove
my hangover cure

in my jacket pocket
a dog treat
of unknown origin

the more things change
a losing lottery ticket

a new year
and i’m fresh out
of words

trying to write
a classic
by candlelight

whiskey dreams
i wake up
to dog breath

the year everyone
gets a lump of coal
in their stockings

deep winter
the haunted forest
of my dreams

lost in the woods
just when i thought
i’d forgotten you

crossing the drawbridge
i lower
my standards

fair-weather clouds
an unfinished dream

the rest of us
falling off the wagon
before it gets here

waxing moon
catching the last bus
just in time

waxing moon
catching
the last bus

back to work
a crow
on a high-tension wire

writer’s block
a hollow log
about to fall

winter rain
the infinite
shades of gray

gone without a trace
my last resolution

winter rain
restless puddles

a long conversation
about mom
slow soaking rain

year of the rooster
and nothing
to crow about

searching for words
overcast dissolves
into dusk

among the whispers
he seemed like
such a nice guy

my rich social life
arguing with strangers
on facebook

long winter
the photograph
of my dreams

adding insult to injury
a winter cold front

sky high
she looks
like rain

a world on fire
whose answered prayer
is this?

urban scarecrow
a cranky old woman
on the f train

my relationship
with stairs has always had
its ups and downs

snow showers
the incredible weight
of being

mostly cloudy
a fugitive
on the run

escorting me
to the last train
the billboard model’s eyes

the dreams
beyond
the smile

continued cold
the silence
echoes

ignorant words
another glacier falls
into the sea

lost at sea
my sand castle dreams

two weeks notice
i can almost hear
the waves

snow in the forecast
widespread shortages
of words

epiphany
i’ve been mispronouncing
her name

a phone call from mom
taking down
the christmas decorations

snowy afternoon
it’s time to shop for
chili pepper seeds

continued cold
a snowdrift
between brothers

since there’s no place to go
tequila reposado

wind-blown snow
what i should have said

just my luck
a two-headed quarter
and i’ve called tails

she’s wearing
my favorite nightgown
nothing at all

tonight’s music
a snowplow symphony

after the snow storm
an absence
of green

raw night
a sudden craving
for sushi

snow falls from a branch
wondering what happened
to the weekend

winter wind
what i
should have said

restless night
the rhythm
of the waves

snow flurries
all the dreams
i’ve forgotten

winter whiteout
the color
of monday

even now
they follow me
the cat’s eyes

tempest in a teapot
we’re out
of coffee

the talking dog
telling me
i dream too much

golden globes
the plunging necklines

why i’m still here
the restless churn
of the ocean

cold snap
the hair stylist
trims my eyebrows

black ice
another stranger tells me
i drink too much

when we’re not looking
pigeons
playing hopscotch

reading the news
so many ways
to hurt each other

warming trend
when snow
turns to mud

under melting snow
the leaves i keep forgetting
to rake

gibbous moon
betrayed
by strangers

cloud-veiled moon
remembering
my first love

gibbous moon
everything means
something else

snow turns to rain
his final words

press conference
an alley cat
cleaning its claws

unseasonably warm
i mix up the names
of my children

tomorrow’s headline
racing down
a dead-end street

nibbling at the bait
another one
that got away

no pity for the troll
beneath the bridge
to nowhere

seaside park
what we left
at the beach

pale sky
the butterfly hunter
announces his engagement

crossing the arroyo
my parched lips

capitol hill
surrounded by
slippery slopes

wolf moon
i skip
shaving today

wolf moon
the cold wind
howls

throwing shade
the elevated highway
that used to be here

never forget
the ones who wouldn’t give me
the time of day

waking early
if only i’d known
it was for a worm

her eyes
the saddest song
ever sung

friday the thirteenth
i tell myself
it’s just a hockey mask

today’s headline
a dog finds his place
in the sun

baja noon
a donkey’s tail
swatting flies

dive bar
rock bottom
is closer
than you think

cold front
the waitress asks
if i have cash

dreams of spring
a cloudless sky
full of kites

the ferris wheel never stops
in the coney island
of my dreams

town dump
the somber procession
of christmas trees

sunday hangover
swearing at the clothes
that no longer fit

a pebble in my shoe
someone mentions
her name

calm seas
the silence of fishermen
in the dark

silence
fishermen
in the dark

sunday in suburbia
the pre-recorded church bells

no-spin zone
the knuckleballer’s
first pitch

nostalgic for the circus
i turn on the news

gibbous moon
wondering where
it all went wrong

emptying her wine glass
she says
you’re next

breaking news
russian tweets in a bottle
washed ashore

over the hill
my default
destination

frost on the mirror
just as close
as it appears

like the universe
my waistline
expands

upscale bar
the well-dressed
downward spiral

a kiss to remember
the one
that never happened

freezing rain
not everything that glitters
is gold

our final goodbye
footprints
on the moon

waning moon
the comfort
in darkness

flame sky
the fierce urgency
of now

today’s headline
a boulder
in my shoe

winter advisory
a new light
next door

staring back at me
the faces
in the cloud

always closer
than you think
the last step

mixed precipitation
taking the bad
along with the bad

so much depends
on a bottle of lightning
in a golden tower

cranking the engine
i too
am out of gas

freezing rain
i lose
my train of thought

writer’s block
the din
of freezing rain

fireworks
a hyperactive
twitter feed

winter morning
steam rising
from a tree stump

sunflowers
telling me
it was all a dream

wondering
if my head injury
was fatal

hailing a taxi
the shadows
wish me luck

chased
by the echo
of my own footsteps

writer’s block
the jetway
pulls away

first to the gate
a pair
of sparrows

bitter cold
no one at the soup kitchen
cares how i voted

end of an era
i put away
my skinny jeans

cleared for take-off
her soft cotton nightgown

enthralled
by an in-flight movie
i’d never watch

finding my seat
an apple falls
from the overhead bin

also interested
in my book
the seat back
of the passenger
in front of me

from 30,000 feet
the sameness
of trump’s america

crowded airplane
i lose another game
of solitaire

what the backs
of their heads
are telling me

in the exit row
an overheard conversation
i’d like to escape

inauguration day
the unrelenting drone
of a jet engine

just when
i needed it most
todos santos sunset

across the arroyo
a big dog
watching me

so beautiful
the bird that woke me up
before dawn

guarding
his ocean fortress
fair-weather clouds

empty goldfish pond
my first
heavy sigh

remembering how much
i missed the sun

one day later
a white-washed
website

silencing the ocean’s sound
a backhoe
on the dunes

hearing my spanish
the waiter replies
in english

was it all a dream?
the restless churn
of the ocean

waiting for me
a path
in the desert

finishing
a good book
desert breeze

she’s wearing
my favorite perfume
desert breeze

i love
what she’s wearing
desert breeze

in other news
rain falling
in the mountains

wheels within wheels
when lies become
alternative facts

right where
it belongs
desert flower

baja sunset
the old dog
doesn’t care

blind date
an unmatched
parenthesis

where it all begins
baja sunrise

at the foot of grandma’s bed
the ashes
of a thousand cigarettes

fumbling for change
in a foreign currency
the waitress’ patient smile

fumbling for change
in a foreign currency
the waitress’ half-smile

soft breeze
the last time
we kissed

a solitary light
the things
we leave behind

baja noon
street dog
in the shade

beautiful agony
that smile
from deep within

everything
i’ve been trying to say
ocean mist

even here
the scars
we leave behind

the sun sets
into cricket song

that perfect day
when i don’t mind
being alone

final whistle
i board the train
alone

old pond
i throw a pebble
at the moon

a rooster crows
just because
he can

by executive order
the end
of the rainbow

lost in an ocean wave
my mother’s memory

feeling lucky
i splurge
on another lottery ticket

mending the fences
that keep us apart

turning the pages
of a book
i can’t finish

everything i can’t see
in the ocean mist

a child’s kite
trying to stay
above it all

racing sunset
a sudden flurry
of construction

making eye contact
with a shoplifter
crescent moon

crossing a line
in the sand
winter shadows

writer’s block
a cormorant
comes up empty

when there’s nothing
left to say
baja sunset

spouting off
with abandon
a gray whale

whispering
behind my back
the palm orchard

palm orchard
whispering
behind my back

wishing on a star
the waves
answer back

tired of the news
i dream
of wild horses

wondering where
the wandering dog
will sleep tonight

hope
a house
on a hill

wondering
if the rooster knows
it’s his year

peace at last
i log off
social media

desert fire
the bougainvillea tree

dimming the lights
i’ll go where ever
her lips take me

slow night
the chef plays soccer
with her son

slow night
no applause
for the one-man band

still waters
a panga unloads
disappointment

no tears
just an empty palapa
with our names on it

as if sad
to see us go
palm leaves
perfectly still

fence? what fence?
three bulls grazing
by the road

leaving baja
the exit is definitely
behind me

reaching an altitude
of 30,000 decibels
a screaming baby

crossing the river
into executive disorder

that dream
where sunset
meets horizon

winter wind
the absence
of palm leaves

picking the orange pits
from my twitter feed

when the ocean
is too far away
tinnitus

between sighs
my date
with a daydream

low tide
the things
we leave behind

vacation ends
with no alternate facts
in the pipeline

vacation ends
with no alternative facts
in the pipeline

even when sleeping
the dog’s ears
at attention

counting the stars
whose names
i used to know

meanwhile in the news
wall street remembers
it’s winter

believing
the voices in my head
mean well

a furtive wink
all that’s left
of the moon

rejecting immigrants
the son
of immigrants

meanwhile on twitter
a faucet dripping
all night long

baja sunset
never enough time
to enjoy it

baja sunset
never enough time

snow flurries
my retirement daydreams

snow flurries
my mother’s
shuffling steps

always demanding attention
the dog interrupts
our kiss

always demanding attention
a permanent stain
in the carpet

snow flurries
wondering if i’ll see you
in my dreams tonight

at the end of the day
all staircases
lead downward

pale winter sky
an unfinished haiku
in my draft folder

pale winter sky
an unfinished haiku

fresh snow
the dog sniffs
fresh footprints

fresh snow
dreams of
a forgotten shipwreck

in other news
the dog’s water bowl
in the snow

dirty snow
a stranger tells me
it’s not a haiku

for the sake of peace
two brothers change the subject
to baseball

for the sake of peace
two brothers change the subject
to death metal

tidal pool
when there’s nowhere
to go

misplacing my passport
i cease to exist

if a thief leaves no fingerprints
were you really robbed?

groundhog day
the sudden chill
when i see my shadow

detained at the airport
a mother’s dream

all smiles
nurses arrive
for the graveyard shift

winter wind
the spoiled child
throws a tantrum

detained for questioning
the sock thief

the old woman
touching the letters
of a tombstone

the hesitation in his voice
when he says
ex-wife

winter advisory
her angry scowl

winter advisory
her scowl

in today’s news
the catbox
overflowing

a fine wine
her voluptuous lips

waxing moon
the insistent whir
of the ceiling fan

yes i know
he looks younger
my passport photo

the flash of cars
racing by
my dilated pupils

pale winter sky
the honor student who never
raises his hand

just out of reach
truths
the hand
can touch

dimmed lights
the play
within the play

crow
at one
with the darkness

storm tide
the ocean
beckons

still pond
a pebble
shatters the moon

the big game
an old chew toy’s
second life

super bowl sunday
the dog
wants to play

desert dream
a door
in the sand

valentine’s day
let’s close our eyes
and pretend it’s spring

tomorrow’s weather
an updated
org chart

play at the plate
free food
in the conference room

smoke without fire
the devil
in the details

approaching snow
the glass
half full

wintry mix
what is and isn’t
a haiku

behind tinted windows
two shadows
in animated conversation

snow turns to rain
my empty wallet

restless night
the dog keeps chasing you
from my dream

every exit
is an entrance
somewhere else

clouds at sunset
missing my grandchildren
tonight

winter fog
a newly opened
line of credit

silenced
a flaw
in the system

winter fog
a childhood photo
i don’t remember

silent snow
secret snow
when dreams elude me

approaching storm
the conversation turns
to politics

still expecting to see
an awkward teenager
in the mirror

safe from the snow
a gray squirrel
and his acorn

blizzard warning
the company’s
earnings report

blizzard warning
another executive order

the dog dreams
rabbit tracks
in the snow

delusional comfort
i can no longer see
the snow

trying not to gloat
the dog
and his bone

howling wind
the death
of a stranger

keeping me warm
all night long
her black lace teddy

arctic wind
my liquid assets
frozen

wiped clean of content
the white house website

i’m innocent, he said,
surrounded by
shatter-proof glass

winter sun
the dog finds a tennis ball
in the snow

snow moon
dreaming of a place
without snow

subway star
bowing to an audience
only he can see

ice fishing
the bait
not taken

clean as a whistle
and then i see
the whistle

guard dog
defending us
from our neighbors

somewhere above
the snow clouds
snow moon

under the red umbrella
the best tamales in town

she asks my name
so many miles
of unpaved road

approaching snow
i compliment
her bleached hair

wondering how
it can look so beautiful
on a postcard

called a snowflake
i realize
there’s a lot of me

fresh snow
our losing
lottery tickets

just scraping by
another snowplow

a dozen roses
what is and isn’t
a valentine

fresh snow
pitchers and catchers
report

reorganization
a cascade
of windblown snow

valentine’s eve
i stop
to smell the roses

winter wind
a cocktail
i can’t finish

interview day
his freshly-shorn
dreadlocks

dreaming
that i sleepwalked
in a dream

cheap tequila
when the tail
wags the dog

doomed
like i am
winter moth

valentine’s day
so many withered roses
to choose from

valentine’s day
so many
withered roses

wanted
another way
to say snow

a lewd act
my car covered
with tree pollen

unhappy valentine
a glass of champagne
while working

tomorrow’s weather
clouds of
obfuscation

winter fog
the doctor murmurs
alzheimer’s

red red wine
the taste
of your lips

fog moon
forgetting the name
of that song

unhinged
the door locks
behind me

dirty snow
the psychology
of spin

in someone else’s dream
beachfront property
returning to sea

lost at sea
my beachfront dreams

between twitter tantrums
fresh snow

before i reach
for the smart phone
fresh snow

snow showers
voices huddled
in whispers

meanwhile on twitter
a mud puddle
freezes over

getting older
another leak
in my bucket list

meanwhile on facebook
everyone’s weather
is better than mine

red light
the dog barks
at the crossing guard

pay day
a waning
gibbous moon

dirty snow
an email for burial insurance
in my spam folder

waning moon
too tired
to sigh

in a broken mirror
the ghost
of who i used to be

dreams of summer
the pepper plant’s
withered leaves

dreams of summer
the chile pepper plant’s
withered leaves

interrupting
my cherry blossom dream
winter wind

unhinged
a broken door
rattling in the wind

mid-winter thaw
i can’t bear to tell
the daffodils

winter storm
tying down
the palapa

winter storm
the restless
arroyo

campaign rally
how gently we go
into that goodnight

clear sky
i forget
my next two lines

marginal street
remembering
her perfume

cherry blossoms
a carefully cropped
photograph

mid-winter thaw
my inspiration
melts away

a break in the clouds
trying to remember
the last time i dreamed

ghost town
even the ghosts
are gone

winter nor’easter
a fresh pot
of coffee

winter silence
a friend’s
sudden death

cloudless sky
a hazy ipa

awakened
by the fireworks
in my dreams

finally retired
i search
for sand dollars

inflexible
my downward dog
won’t get up

falling temperatures
the grumbling
among crows

warming trend
the guard dog
sniffs my hand

lunch time
the vending machine
eats my last dollar

daffodils
a cruel flirt

mid-winter thaw
my blood pressure
also rises

mild temperatures
when the new boss knows how
to pronounce my name

fair-weather clouds
when the new boss knows how
to pronounce my name

chance of rain
she tells me
i mumble

ocean breeze
trying not
to fall in love

the engineer admits
his heart isn’t
literally broken

always too soon
the change from leaf blower
to snow blower

watching the waves
widening coils
of cigar smoke

continuous coverage
of how far
we’ve fallen

a decision
that makes itself
another margarita

cloudless sky
and every reason
to be cranky

flash fiction
i stand on the roof deck
and pretend i’m naked

passing clouds
a dozen
unwithered roses

dreams of summer
my iced coffee
grows warm

my shuffling steps
this mortal coil

mild winter day
chickadees
in bloom

watching the press conference
a craving for muddled wine

daydreaming
a long way down

in short
that dress

winter dog walk
something the owl
left behind

armchair fishermen
teaching a man
how to fish

in my spam folder
a letter
to whom it may concern

record warmth
when you’re
almost there

record warmth
a roll
of the dice

record warmth
we were
so close

to be or not to be
that parent
in the crowd

how quickly we cross
to the other side
of the bridge

suburban gridlock
two dogs
lock eyes

signing the letter
bare tree branches
perfectly still

at the protest site
tearing down a sign reading
this land is our land

seasonably cold
i liked you better
before politics

seasonably cold
back to minding
my own business

the chill returns
what i’ve given up
for lent

the city boy stacks wood
a wheelbarrow
with one handle

denying
the melting elephant
in the room

the old widow
cleaning graffiti
from a tombstone

tonight’s twitter feed
a frozen
mud puddle

dinner party
no one tells me
i’ve lost weight

mardis gras
all of the clothes
that no longer fit

fat tuesday
an empty
vending machine

new moon
always avoiding
the question

hope springs eternal
a fire escape garden

waning moon
all the women who told me
they loved me

pulling up dandelions
only the crows
object

writer’s block
a hollow log
full of bees

in the mirror
the boy who never
raised his hand

a break in the cloud
the lights
go out

fat tuesday
the dog tries
to eat a bug

overcast
what could
have been

somewhere
above the clouds
a crescent moon

state of the union
a married couple
texting separately

first of march
the puppy’s
hopeful face

fake news
a cornered rabbit
blames the carrot

airport security
my twelve-dollar
martini

found
where the wet paint sign
should have been

ash wednesday
finding
an old cigar

day drinking
a fawn bows her head
over the stream

ash wednesday
dreams
of your silhouette

winter returns
words
from a teleprompter

wildlife refuge
five hungry tigers
in the back seat

colder
when he enters the room
old man winter

colder
when she enters the room
my exwife

winter stillness
an empty barn

reminding an old friend
that confidence
begins with con

winter wind
so many questions
unanswered

resistance
on both sides
of the leash

never where
i belong
artic chill

overlooking
a suburban parking lot
the motel lounge

in an empty ballroom
i dance
with ghosts

realizing
no one taught me
how to fall

snow squall
an unwanted touch

settled at the bar
a snow squall
marches in

reflecting only irony
the fake crystal chandelier

crow moon
the wind howls

howling wind
unfollowing
a friend

my favorite songbird
the one who
flew away

the new normal
measuring my outrage
in retweets

bitter cold
the dog whimpers
in his sleep

bitterly cold
an unsigned check

restless night
a limousine idling
across the street

remembering when
she wore pigtails
my vegetarian daughter

just like that
the door closes
with a dull click

tomorrow’s weather
clearly a chance
of partly cloudy

seeking a diversion
the dog
grabs my slipper

squirrel!
the next
news headline

open mic
that moment you realize
no one’s listening

her high heels
stabbing the darkness

late for meditation
someone else is chanting
my mantra

whitehouse gridlock
red lights
in all directions

now serving tables
at a greasy spoon
the one-hit wonder

rounding third base
a non-roster invitee
destined for home

so it wasn’t a dream
your panties
on my dresser

it no longer
goes without saying
don’t forget to breathe

remembering when darkness
belonged to the night

found
an app to name the stars
i used to know

lost among stars
sad music
of the night

remembering
when leaving it all behind
was a choice

among ruins
all hail
the abandoned car

at the end of the day
a defiant yawn

room with a view
a mountain
of unpaid bills

winter thunder
the baby throws
another tantrum

march madness
remembering
how to swear

why i keep breathing
the desert in bloom

strange town
the strange looks
when i fold my pizza

happy hour
the unhappy
bartender

i’m finally
at the age to say
when i was your age

undocumented
the mouse
in the pantry

venus rising
a woman scorned

gibbous moon
the approaching cold

purple verbena
the perfume
of my dreams

we’re finally that couple
who brings their pills
to dinner

never changing
its angry tune
winter wind

never changing
its tune
winter wind

so far away
my mother’s
vacant stare

last to the party
i’m introduced
as the birth father

spring snow
an ultrasound
of my new grandson

turning the clock ahead
i grow older
faster

spring snow
the street cat
wants to come inside

spring thaw
reminding my mother
who i am

marsh grass
the undulation
of my dreams

no coincidence
that nothing rhymes
with orange

in my spam folder
another solicitation
for burial insurance

winter chill
a mouse caught alive
in the trap

slow blues
the bartender takes
a smoke break

my vote
the blue jay’s
noisy call

daylight savings
the clock turned back
fifty years

winter storm watch
when hell
freezes over

worm moon
pitying
the early bird

passing through security
a sandwich
of unknown origin

blizzard watch
a puppy
finds the toilet paper

blizzard warning
exactly
as expected

spring snow
braiding
my granddaughter’s hair

so close
the faraway look
in her eyes

waiting for the bus
every one of us
growing old

the recorded message
not responsible
for lost articles

unfriendly skies
an extra charge
for my baggage

en route to florida
a caravan
of wheelchairs

getting old
my parents’
grandfather clock

getting old
the grandfather clock

perfectly legal
the ace’s
borderline pitch

artificially sweetener
another planned community

in today’s news
eight dollars
for a bud light

today’s weather
eight dollars
for a bud light

a border wall
between the gated community
and the world

banyan tree
clinging
to the past

cheap wine
my father offers me
the sweater i gave him

snow emergency
miscalculating
the beer

the songs they sing
a busker’s
tarnished sax

the good life
a screened-in
lanai

following wall street
a pelican plunges

watching
the world go by
egret

discussing the news
smokers and
their partisan hacks

spring training
not a spring chicken
in sight

passing time
the same
old story

with leftovers
a fresh argument
over politics

leftover politics
never as fresh
as the revolution

pale sky
my mother keeps ​asking
where i live

after the tweet storm
a pile
of dirty snow

lost
in the bamboo forest
of my dreams

cowering
from my outstretched hand
the wounded street dog

when it seems
i’m the only one
not limping

saint patrick’s day
an ill-behaved child
in the rear of the plane

getting my irish up
her long red hair

the white house
now presenting
the hunger games

waiting for my luggage
the shuttle bus
pulls away

summer breeze
what we whispered
among the sand dunes

writer’s block
running out of ways
to say snow

budget cut
the bartender
says i’m done

the darkness she followed
that invisible night

missing
the awful restaurant
that once stood here

march madness
awake
at 3 a.m.

snake oil
the politician’s
handshake

spring fever
another freckle
to kiss

those eyes
what never
could have been

awake too late
the night

tomorrow’s headlines
wondering how our grandchildren
will judge us

overcast
staring into
monday

overcast
it must be time
to do our taxes

spring in the air
the dog picks up
a scent

sweet sixteen
no one wants
to dance with me

false spring
the pitcher fails
to cover first base

equinox
i even up
my sideburns

writer’s block
i fill out
my taxes

first day of spring
weeds already
in the garden

on capitol hill
a watched pot
boiling

waning moon
like no one’s
watching

tuesday
stuck
behind a school bus

writer’s block
an unfurnished room
downtown

coney island dreams
stuck at the top
of the ferris wheel

spring thaw
an undiscovered
pop song

walking alone
except the ringing
in my ears

walking alone
the ringing
in my ears

march madness
more snow
in the forecast

meanwhile
on pennsylvania avenue
an overflowing trash can

fresh tracks in the snow
the dog launches
an investigation

fresh tracks in the snow
the dog investigates

snow showers
my retirement portfolio
takes a bath

unmoved
by my dilemma
garden buddha

wind advisory
a hastily arranged
press conference

we’ll never know
what was lost
in the fire

speculation
what was lost
in the wind

here and gone
too soon
crocuses

abandoned at the station
a coffee
with my name on it

conundrum
when the truth
lies between us

never too early
for an argument
a tree filled with crows

orangutan
repealing
the banana

it used to be
our paradise
by the lake

a border wall
between
gated communities

dressing up
the desert hillside
evening primrose

writer’s block
a hawk circling
the featureless sky

years later
he still won’t open
his late wife’s mail

out of firewood
i have
an ax to grind

otherwise
the rhythm
of the waves

to your health
a slip and slide into
the high-risk pool

mixed precipitation
i revise
another poem

wind-blown snow
another
broken promise

blown save
i pocket-dial
a stranger

lighting the fire
she unbuttons
her blouse

snow bank
the dog withdraws
a tennis ball

nothing to say
an overcast sky
at dusk

that familiar groan
the last train
approaches

the last train
that familiar groan

silly owl
you know
who i am

team chemistry
realizing
everything dissolves

alone on the l train
between lost
and found

police lights
my old neighborhood
gentrified

cold rain
a deal i didn’t make
with the devil

monday morning
a child’s toy
overturned in the mud

slow steady rain
when the darkness
is a lie

slow steady rain
when the rainbow
is a lie

when no one knows
how many times
i’ve died

three days to pay day
the last
of the leftovers

this windowless room
who will make me
feel the rain?

this windowless room
who will let me
feel the rain?

happy hour
let the complaining
begin

heavy sigh
telling ourselves
we need the rain

her false eyelashes
not knowing
what to believe

getting through
my spam filter
unclaimed millions

counting out change
in a foreign currency
the bartender’s smile

sweet music
that sound you don’t realize
you’re making

passing the yoga studio
i balance
my checkbook

snow in the forecast
the crocuses
shiver

spring snow
she asks me when
i started turning gray

hours later
a taxicab
by the almond tree

april fool
expecting
april snow

politics and breakfast
peace and quiet
over easy

returning from the water cooler
strangers eye my desk

whitewashed
this world
of mud

no smoking gun
said the arsonist
surrounded by flames

rain changes
to snow
april fools

mixed precipitation
she correctly guesses
my age

crossing the border
two lovebirds
and their shadows

april fool
that puddle doesn’t
look too deep

spring snow
his young
new girlfriend

the week’s forecast
a crow
in the bird bath

afters the rain
a cloudless
puddle

opening day
shaking the cobwebs
from my baseball cap

skipping a stone
on the water
under the bridge

suspension
of disbelief
the weekend
is over

trouble brewing
one double espresso
too many

hunger moon
his younger lover

waxing moon
a freshly cleaned desk

wondering if today
will be the day
i stop writing

opening day
daffodils
in bloom

opening day
she wears
my favorite uniform

late for dinner
a fox
in a tree

opening day
i hear
her confession

sick day
a red-tailed hawk
in the rain

rain without thunder
the slugger watches
strike three

today’s forecast
a world
of mud

after the rain
a world
of mud

in my dreams
a break
in the rain

ringing in my ears
the assassin’s bullet

steady rain
the doctor thinks
i drink too much

waking from a dream
what i saw
in the water lilies

the big announcement
pushing the door
labeled pull

troubled sleep
a distant
car alarm

shadows
whispering
behind me

at the end of the bar
misery
keeps me company

scoreless game
my empty
wine glass

low tide
everything
we’ve left behind

hard rain
the subject line reads
cancer

flood watch
and nowhere
to go

destined
for confirmation
my suspicions

thunderstorm warning
the silence
of crows

the nuclear option
approaching thunder

after the rain
the last time
we made love

freshly cut grass
my grandson’s
first ballgame

before the dust settles
talking heads
in unison

tired of the rain
we complain
that the sun is too bright

spring sun
a day of scattered
sunflower shells

town dump
i recycle
a political leaflet

spring breeze
thinking it should be
warmer by now

wind chimes
thinking it should be
warmer by now

wondering who’s snapping
those sexy photos

spring thaw
when an old classic
is just old

flickering screen
i wonder who’s snapping
those sexy photos

unlike me
it never gets old
baja sunset

palm sunday
the beggar frowns
at my change

striking
a defiant pose
the boojum tree

writer’s block
a day
without clouds

palm sunday
wondering where
my life line leads

caught in the brambles
the secrets
of suburban trash

caught in the brambles
suburban trash

caught in the brambles
so much
suburban trash

fresh frost
on my beer mug
dreams of sunset

in a windowless bunker
the tail
wags the dog

egg moon
the tail
wags the dog

on its way
pink moon

fish moon
it’s all water
under the bridge

daylilies
my alibi
unravels

high tide
it all comes
crashing down

tempest in a teapot
the broken
coffee machine

pink moon
her facebook status
it’s a boy

off night
the troubadour’s
thrift store suit

morning fog
on the wrong side
of wednesday

after the rain
daffodils
casting shadows

pink moon
he doesn’t want
to be photographed

waning moon
he tells me the cancer
is back

his voice
suddenly
a dark alley

last call
telling the bartender
i’m good for one more

a chorus of boos
the knuckleballer takes
the night off

thursday
a seagull flies
into the sun

in its own
little world
a dead goldfish

semana santa
the miracle of the
open parking space

through an open window
dreams of summer

rose buds
her voluptuous lips

melting snow
her unceremonious
disappearance

good friday
dandelion seeds
in the wind

chive blossoms
another song
i shouldn’t like

good friday
no need to check
my portfoliio

windless night
watching the water
where you walked away

good friday
an unexpected
phone call

after sunset
the sad-eyed lady
of my dreams

tax day
a pigeon puffs out
its chest feathers

day of the sun
jackie robinson
steps up to the plate

wild flowers
swinging at a pitch
in the dirt

the smell of spring
a freshly oiled
baseball glove

lost among the stars
the breath i was saving
for sunrise

easter procession
pastel dresses
and sunday drivers

out for an encore
the ugly man
with a velvet voice

head full of dreams
i create
a new cocktail

spring sunset
just another
pretty girl

leaning against
a crooked tombstone
her tender kiss

spring twilight
i remember the jasmine
of my dreams

end of the weekend
in search of
a gentle moon

oh how they shine
the rain-swept cobblestones
of my dreams

rain
an unexpected
dinner guest

the luxury condos
where the river
used to flow

luxury condos
named for the river
that used to be here

marathon monday
one meeting
after another

transition plan
a terrible name
for a cocktail

not so fast
a mid-spring
cold front

transparency
not the same
as invisible

late spring
shaking the cobwebs
from my gym shorts

wall street dreams
a sky filled
with golden parachutes

turning off the tv
a sad clown
in the sun

spring sunshine
remembering how to spell
forsythia

a song so pretty
i have to
shut it off

tax day
stepping into
a spider web

the roof retracts
a three-year rookie’s
last chance

when the ghosts
in the shadows
look away

new moon
everything
that can hurt you

candlelight diplomacy
i surrender

executive order
a flickering candle

i love
what she’s wearing
the waning moonlight

under the maple tree
a budding romance

writer’s block
a housefly
in the curtains

in search of better climate
fair-weather clouds

storm clouds
betrayed by
a one-eyed jack

light rain
my heavy heart

closing the window
a dog barking
at ghosts

easter week
the dog chases
dust bunnies

correcting a typo
in the new graffiti

crescent moon
my eyes struggling
to stay open

stars in your eyes
a marvelous night
for a moondance

crescent moon
an old dog’s
dreams

crescent moon
the weed dealer’s
bicycle

shooting star
a picture of him
smiling

writer’s block
an alpaca
chews its cud

always on time
chain smokers
in the rain

unblinking
the gang banger’s
teardrop tattoo

desert sunset
why do i still
burn for you?

tireless
the waves crashing
in my dreams

earth day
paw prints
on the couch

earth day
remembering where
the puppy was buried

earth day
remembering where
the puppies were buried

climate change
a stack of science books
in the fire

mostly cloudy
azaleas
in protest

that recurring dream
when i board the train
without her

celebrating
her smile
for someone else

that song
i forgot
was so good

million dollar view
a mountain
of debt

visiting the nursing home
fallen azalea petals

cloudless sky
when there’s nothing left
to say

before
hell freezes over
a glacier melts

migrant workers
harvesting
the horizon

sharecroppers
harvesting
the horizon

moving day
a missing
puzzle piece

spring mud
a month
of mondays

hazy sky
the one
that got away

rain in the forecast
i finish my beer
too quickly

its majestic wings
up close
a turkey vulture

its majestic wings
up close
a turkey buzzard

a new stop sign
wild turkeys
in the field

beach house dream
a sand castle
at high tide

old dog
the smell
of rain

when your final destination
is over the hill

restless night
a rusty old shipwreck

the beautiful stranger
who tells me
she’s been waiting for me

that dream
where all the sea shells
lead to happy hour

rain out
our rivalry
with the sun

soaked masses
believing the rain
is sunshine

wheels within wheels
the darling buds
of may

twilight
i order grits and gravy
with a brooklyn accent

twilight
grits and gravy
with a brooklyn accent

new moon
up to its old tricks
behind a cloud

fenway fog
who’s on first?

last call
a chorus
of boos

morning fog
the drone
of rush hour traffic

morning fog
a second cup
of bad coffee

off-season
the flames
of the electric fireplace

a wood burning stove
i remember
falling snow

electric fireplace
the stories
they could tell

gray day
feeling
my age

off-season
the hush
among locals

in sepia tones
the main street
of my dreams

new moon
a reassuring creak
in the floor

the whimsical colors
of the whale
above the mantle

back in season
a may-december romance

over easy
with an extra helping
of vocal fry

hidden in the fog
our village
of dreams

split-fingered fastball
a squirrel
in the bird feeder

backyard buddha
finding peace
among the weeds

night terrors
it could all go away
like that

at the end of the day
a figure of speech

reflecting
the sun’s glare
angry waves

circus freak
the one
without tattoos

crossing the bridge
into slow steady rain

passing clouds
wondering what
they see in me

may day
a bridge
too far

carpenter ants
constructing
a nightmare

the wrong time
for the shadows
to be silent

of all times
for the shadows
to be silent

spring twilight
putting the leaves
back on the trees

spring twilight
our best and final offer
in a text

waiting for the light to change
the buzz of the bass

a deep breath
when there’s no place
for the rain to go

town meeting
the fog
rolls in

lilacs in bloom
i forget
the question

feast of crumbs
we all pretend
to be full

rejection letter
misspelling
my name

cicadas
my ringing ears

keeping the dream alive
a third cup of coffee

alone with my thoughts
a door leading nowhere

spring bluster
a 98 m.p.h. fastball
high and tight

fresh mulch
the fragrance
of suburbia

too young to know
what her smile
means to me

spring twilight
when the skies decide
to clear

frost advisory
her blonde highlights

not searching
for a reason
first dragonfly

cloudless skies
the thunder
of landscapers

each grain of sand
between my toes
a thundering ocean

longing for
that idyllic place
i’ve never been to

cinco de mayo
waiting for the cactus
to blink

cold coffee
herring swimming
upstream

lengthening days
signing
my life away

may showers
comparing
credit scores

sweeter than i expected
the fruit
of a prickly pear

last of the firewood
an earwig jailbreak

did my stomach growl
or is that synthesizer
out of tune?

lingering showers
i take the covers back
from the dog

in the amber light
all my dreams
come true

spring sunset
the amber corners
of an old photograph

home inspection
i toss a penny
into the fountain

spilt milk
it must be time
for a missile strike

always dreaming
i remember
magnolia blossoms

listening closely
to what the river
is telling me

summer heat
the garden gnome mocks
how i’ve mowed the lawn

summer heat
the garden gnome mocks
my landscaping skills

home inspection
what’s in the urn
she’s leaving behind?

partly cloudy
submitting
the loan application

spring sunshine
another freckle
to kiss

dogwood blossoms
an ultrasound
of my newest grandson

clouds dispersing
into twilight

windless night
a chorus
of cicadas

exchanging glances
in the waiting room
a plastic fern
and i

may day!
a hornet’s nest
in the birdhouse

broken clouds
the meeting
is cancelled

flower moon
my granddaughters braid
each other’s hair

flower moon
my granddaughter hands me
a dandelion

fever dream
her silhouette
in the window

breaking news
dandelion seeds
in the air

guarding
the temple ruins
a giant iguana

after the rain
i remember how to spell
rhododendron

sleepwalking
through streets
of fire

shooting star
the best haiku
i almost wrote

entering
from the fire escape
the scent of lilacs

trying not
to boil over
i stew
over the news

the smoking gun
that killed
democracy

milk moon
my pale complexion

overcast night
the rookie reliever
doesn’t get the call

jasmine
immediately i am
somewhere else

sand castles
let’s build
another world

reaching out
from the bog
arrowheads

blaming the sunshine
for the rain

overcast
the old man’s
scowl

joint custody
a mix of sunshine
and clouds

spring cleaning
her love letters
in the fire

holding me tight
the seams
in her stockings

today’s news
a leech
that won’t let go

setting aside the walker
an old man taps his foot
to zydeco

may showers
who can say
what they bring?

colorful and bright
the parking ticket
on my windshield

may nor’easter
striking out
the side

at the end of the bar
the ghost who buys me
another drink

windows closed
the lilac breeze
of my dreams

midnight
the fragrance
of rain

meandering
i find
where i need to be

mother’s day rain
the rose bush i planted
for her

writer’s block
a burned-out
light bulb

light drizzle
the rookie legs out
an infield single

nantucket sound
i hear it
in my dreams

spring migration
the snow shovel returns
to the shed

signs of spring
migrating snowbirds

end of the weekend
an idling
garbage truck

denial
the thermostat
kicks on

mother’s day
she hands the phone
to dad

writer’s block
when the rain
stops falling

record heat
she takes off
her bikini

record heat
she slips out of
something comfortable

remembering a time
when only birds
would tweet

asking if i have exact change
the cashier’s shaking hands

broken clouds
an unusual charge
to my credit card

all-night laundromat
the persistence
of infomercials

a break in the weather
a puppy
chasing butterflies

the new org chart
a mix of sun
and clouds

shifting winds
a mixed day
on wall street

in the news
a rabbit’s nest
in the flower garden

the ocean between
the news
and the truth

smear campaign
the reporter’s
runny mascara

accusations
and rebuttals
the turnpike din

wise to me
the barn owl

the morning headline
oak seed pods
spinning in the wind

record highs
the dow
takes a tumble

air quality alert
we blame
the dog

warm night
the dog’s breath

my retirement fund
rose petals
in the wind

record heat
a passing breeze
on the ledge

a cold beer
to quench
the silence

today’s weather
four walls
and an empty whiteboard

boston wildlife
a bike courier
flips me the bird

today’s weather
a slight chance
of relevance

the wait
a need for
too much coffee

a rusty old bridge
to a memory

choking the garden
the ragweed’s
deep roots

bright sunshine
a shower
of losing
powerball tickets

spring at last
the vibrant colors
of fresh graffiti

her tight red blouse
a ripening blossum
ready to burst

too nice to be rags
all the clothes
that no longer fit

when she knows we can see her
through the curtain-less window

yard sale
their curtain-less
windows

above our tv set
an angry god
of the sea

cape traffic
a snail crosses
the patio

a single mom
leaves a tip
for the street juggler

open house
the joy of sex
on the coffee table

open streets
bare-chested children dancing
to salsa music

hung over
the graduate
comes home

the graduate
looking for
a toad to kiss

back to work
how does google know
i have bad breath?

spring overcast
misspelling
the new employee’s name

pleading the fifth
when it’s cloudy
it pours

closed
for the foreseeable future
the psychic’s shop

on a beautiful day
her awkward tears

sagamore bridge gridlock
the rush to escape
the weekend escape

the clown’s fingerprints
on a child’s balloon

rabbit hole
the mutual friends i share
with a stranger

overcast
night after night
of dreamless sleep

game day
the rookie’s
animated tweets

the dog wonders why
my opposable thumbs
can’t stop the rain

always in
the spin zone
weather vane

in other news
a dog’s nose
in the rabbit nest

closing day
fair market price
for a field of weeds

overcast
the fear
of forgetting

the enchanted forest
occupied
by extremists

when all
is said and done
lilacs

the inappropriate dress
she wore
just for me

stream of consciousness
an unfiltered ipa

midnight
she’s speaking
my body language

holiday weekend
a traffic helicopter
rumbles by

home-brew forecast
cloudy with a chance
of hoppiness

after the rain
a tree frog
serenade

después de la lluvia
el canto
del coquí

icing on her nose
a one year-old’s
birthday party

yard sale
all of the clothes
that don’t fit

zinnias
thinking of
an absent friend

for an absent friend
zinnias

memorial day
forgetting
her name

nothing but the truth
an unfiltered ipa

sleeping
in the cemetery
an unknown soldier

memorial day
another birthday
for a late classmate

missing in action
the hollow eyes
of a veteran

spring rain
an 8-mile backup
at the sagamore bridge

memorial day rain
an 8-mile backup
at the sagamore bridge

his head on my knee
a descendant
of wolves

throwing shade
a cartoon cloud
that won’t go away

defending the weak
a withering carnation

monday
watching the horizon
vanish

throwing shade
a cartoon cloud

writer’s block
the tide
goes out

continental breakfast
individually wrapped

gratitude
walking
on eggshells

songbird
never misspelling
a tweet

last day of may
signing
my life away

last day of may
a lone fisherman
in the rain

outside the courthouse
a dog waiting patiently
in the car

sheer delight
her new lingerie

the boudoir shot
heard
around the world

the river
where i started dreaming
in technicolor

beyond the fence
a secret
i don’t want to know

old vines
the malbec
and me

back from college
a trash bag filled
with dirty laundry

closing day
my pen
runs out of ink

snail
withdrawing
from it all

dreaming
of nights
in white satin

a flaw
in the system
my unmatched socks

under bright lights
the exotic dancer’s
familiar yawn

hopeless romantics
in search of
an endless summer

freedom of speech
the mockingbird
at my window

work-life balance
the smell of whiskey
in the break room

writer’s block
an indecisive sky

song wren
a break
in the clouds

house sparrows
wondering where
to spend thanksgiving

clinging to summer
the last leaf
and me

watched like a hawk
the baby rabbit

choir director
cutting me off
in her sunday best

pentecost
a craving
for spicy food

wildflowers
an old cemetery

in the news
a baby’s arm
holding an apple

cold rain
the last time
we made love

earth tones
remembering
how warm they were

a persistent drizzle
in my twitter feed

persistent drizzle
when bad coffee
is good enough

persistent drizzle
somebody mentions
her name

spouting off
another fish tale
the gray whale

her steady hand
no longer afraid
to hear the rain

cold drizzle
when i’ve missed the train
to summer

turning off
the radio
to listen

approaching summer
the cool rain
getting colder

morning rain
lingering
for a kiss

after the closing
another box marked
miscellaneous

after the rain
a dog bowl
full of stars

a dive bar
where the devil
knows my name

in the news
a tree filled
with boisterous birds

starless night
when i think
she could have been mine

i stop talking
the call
of the sea

getting younger
every year
summer interns

and to think
i could have voted
for vermin supreme

enlightened
i avoid
the sun

gathering clouds
and the ones
who shout at them

in other news
grandpa shouts
at clouds

weeknight cocktail
the moon hiding
behind clouds

strawberry moon
another freckle
to kiss

the homecoming queen
who wouldn’t give me
the time of day

weekend forecast
skinny dipping
at sunset

federal currency
a pledge
of loyalty

hung out to dry
my shabby attire

in the waiting room
a soap opera
without tv

pop-up shower
the dog
lifts his head

strawberry moon
her long
red hair

the pride on his face
when he introduces
his husband

shifting wind
the bartender
cuts me off

writer’s block
words leave me
for another poem

writer’s block
words leave me
speechless

writer’s block
words leave me

first hot night
bittersweet
climbs the wall

lost at sea
the homecoming queen

summer moonlight
an entanglement
i can’t resist

summer haze
that place between
coffee and beer

shortest night
of the year
she says yes

unblinking
the eyes
of a three-legged dog

heat wave
the pillow has
no cool side

googling bliss
i get the error
page not found

in her
widening eyes
the unspeakable bliss

field of dreams
the pitcher’s
nightmare inning

june swoon
a steady diet
of curve balls

heat wave
the dog’s breath
in my face

synchronicity
reaching for the hot sauce
our hands touch

today’s
only certainty
dusk

i always knew
you would make
a beautiful ghost

synchronicity
i feel
your heartbeat

against traffic
the can man’s
rusty bicycle

his loyalty endures
until the treats run out

make it yours
an empty
office building

beyond the exit sign
a locked door

reenacting
our argument
with dolls

break in the weather
a red squirrel returns
to taunt the dog

after the hike
i contemplate the wellness
of the well

when the crack
in the mirror
is on your face

those eyes
how convincing she looks
in that devil costume

leaving safe harbor
the dog’s
unblinking eyes

gentle breeze
finding my way
back to shore

new ringtone
a chattering
mockingbird

home from work
a rousing reception
of crows

the day i flew
too close to the sun

light rain
the softest
of kisses

light rain
my heavy sigh

washing down
my cuban sandwich
with a bitter ale

restless night
i wake up
to dog breath

light rain
an extra dry
prosecco

light rain
seed pods dancing
in puddles

light rain
a puppy
licks my face

cloud-veiled moon
remembering the name
of my first love

overcast sky
a distant
drum beat

in this shot glass
everything
i haven’t got

promising to have
only one drink
i order a double

if you’re thinking
what i’m thinking
then we’re pretty much
done thinking

surprise!
the prom queen doesn’t
remember me

monday
it makes no difference
to the mockingbird

father’s day
my daughter calls me
for advice

father’s day
a tick
latches on

awakened from
my baja daydream
a mango falls

writer’s block
an idle windmill

muggy night
the dog’s breath
against my leg

hot summer night
the sizzle
of the bug zapper

sleepless
a mass pike
serenade

sleepless
a mass pike
lullaby

in your arms
i almost believe
in heaven

summer solstice
when all i wanted
was darkness

longest day
my favorite pub
closes

longest day of the year
only the best coffee

pleasure boats
reads the battered sign
at the old marina

last day of school
summer fog
rolls in

midnight
remembering
every contour

just before
i lose my temper
lilacs

rush hour
my father’s slow shuffle
to the phone

solstice toast
may you never run out
of daylight

speed trap
my heartbeat
accelerates

hot summer night
the moon reduced
to a sliver

sleepwalking
in a dream
about daylight

waning moon
careful not to disturb
the rabbit nest

waning moonlight
the darkness
becomes you

young love
a pair
of parking tickets

summer solstice
my unmatched socks

fever dream
a doorway
in the desert

baja sunset
the ranchero’s conversation
with familiar spirits

border cantina
remembering
and forgetting
the alamo

restless night
a fitted sheet
that doesn’t fit

on the house
the bartender’s
skull and crossbones tattoo

summer rain
a pair of
abandoned bicycles

after the rain
the rest
of the weekend

above the welcome mat
side entrance only
no solicitors

taking up two parking spaces
a prius
with a co-exist bumper sticker

testing the smoke alarms
the bachelor
bakes a cake

denying climate change
a hotter ticket
than it used to be

climate change
she unbuttons
her blouse

at the yard sale
he drives a tough bargain
for a buddha statue

bad call
the crowd serenades
the umpire

nothingness
a pre-existing
condition

new moon
i remind my son
to use protection

summer shadows
crossing the border
without passports

in the news
a dung beetle
hard at work

light rain
all that’s left
of the weekend

an empty wine glass
my life
without you

mood indigo
the color
of my dreams

monday morning
always dreaming
i had slept longer

restless night
i pretend the turnpike din
is the ocean

summer breeze
planning my own
obsolescence

in an unheated trailer
his side of the story

beach days
another wave
at the all-night diner

never too soon
the scent
of thyme

construction zone
fresh paint
on cracked pavement

rough weather
a perfect time
for tender lovemaking

rain delay
the catcher slowly
takes off his gear

lightning flash
the dog’s eyes
unblinking

lightning flash
she gets
the final word

starless night
an empty bottle
of wine

double espresso
when she smiles
at me

cloudless sky
the day i forgot
how to write

morning stillness
the space
between us

above the siren choir
the admonition
shelter in place

partly cloudy
my mother asks me
to write a happy poem

a change in the weather
from something
to something else

wild flowers
where the railroad tracks
used to be

sea breeze
that surfboard would make
a great coffee table

entangled
the tension
between us

fireflies
beyond
our reach

alone at the bar
a stranger’s
unfinished tattoo

out of coffee
and no end
to this highway

stuck behind an 18-wheeler
the cold black river below

weeds
in the cracks
of an empty parking lot

we have arrived
an open drawbridge
to nowhere

old mill town
no cellphone reception
but i can see four bars

crossing the border
i set the clock back
decades

holiday traffic
another winnebago
passes me by

even before hunting season
tourist traps
everywhere

seney stretch
miles of nothing
but miles

summer lightning
a shower
of gnats

under new management
bland salsa served
in colorful bowls

studio opening
the artist pencils in
her eyebrows

morning coffee
waiting for summer
to cross the bridge

expecting a deer
behind every tree
the city boy

bright sunshine
my granddaughter’s hands
in my hair

whispering pines
and other reasons
to fear the woods

independence day
the fireworks
in your kiss

giving me
the cold shoulder
the woman
in the hot bikini

independence day
mingling their ashes
in the lake

together again
mingling their ashes
in the lake

a final date
mingling their ashes
in the lake

making their own crosswalk
a sandhill crane
and her chicks

in your arms
what’s left of me
dissolves

three beers later
i invent
a new dance

rumors of war
another cup
of burnt coffee

independence day
my wife is called
by her maiden name

stars and stripes
her newest tattoo

independence day
an old dog
hiding from fireworks

gibbous moon
an empty milk carton
in the refrigerator

independence day
the pacifist applauds
explosions in the sky

cheap wine
an unrequited love

among the trees
the invisible creatures
i know are there

finally alone
the silver-haired bat
wants to hang out

starry night
a broken champagne glass
under my shoe

nothing to say
a deer head
mounted on the wall

starless night
the darkness
between us

morning coffee
woodpeckers inspecting
the garden bed

23rd and broadway
sanitation workers
talking trash

summer rain
heating up
yesterday’s coffee

darkening sky
someone brings up
politics

after the holiday
a parade
of thunderclouds

power outage
a complete game
shutout

after the rain
a bullfrog sounds
the all-clear

the old pond
nothing standing
between us

after the rain
a picnic table covered
with pine needles

after the rain
the butterflies
become mosquitoes

log cabin blues
a back door
that won’t lock

knowing they can see me
these invisible creatures
of the dark

summer thunder
the neighborhood kids
on a four-wheeler

remembering the night
we renamed the stars

restless night
a blank page
in my dream journal

in the middle of nowhere
what can and can’t
be deep-fried

the unsettling feeling
that someone else has seen
this crescent moon

lost lake
right there
on google maps

what was
and wasn’t said
around the fire pit

thunder moon
no one admits
they’ve had too much to drink

promises
everything we burned
in the fire pit

cloudless sky
she says she’s here
to make amends

what does she see
through those crystal meth
blue eyes?

day drinking
the guitarist’s
effects pedals

just passing through
the singer songwriter
who never left

far from home
i dream of walking the dog
in the moonlight

mostly cloudy
junk mail
addressed to her

last day of vacation
my travel-size shaving cream
sputters out

today’s weather
a mix of cold eggs
and burnt coffee

between mile markers
the haiku
that got away

diplomacy
an 18-wheeler
in the passing lane

last day of vacation
letting go
of the steering wheel

buck moon
always one beer
too many

hot summer night
the kiss
that almost wasn’t

peace at last
killing
the elusive mosquito

peace at last
killing
the mosquito

peace at last
i plan
my next daydream

class reunion
i still don’t recognize
forget-me-nots

a yellowed photograph
the death of an uncle
i hardly knew

virtual reality
who will protect me
from the great outdoors?

listening for the answer
to the great riddle
in 128 traffic

playing my tune
and then some
mockingbird

partly cloudy
we greet each other
in different languages

war
always fighting
for attention

muggy night
that wet dog smell

ordering a reuben
i decline
the russian dressing

for whom the bell tolls
death in the afternoon

extra innings
i give up
the last cookie

partly sunny
believing all
the right things

pinch me
my son does the dishes
unprompted

approaching storm
children playing
with matches

old dog
his eyes still chasing
the squirrel

morning gridlock
an unrelenting beat

persistent drizzle
the 24-hour
news cycle

meanwhile on wall street
another cup of coffee
down the drain

summer chill
someone else asks me
about retirement

still pond
the ripples
from our lovemaking

cold front
we agree
to disagree

chilly summer night
the sound
of jangly guitars

campaign promises
construction workers strike
a sewer line

at the mercy
of tyrants
a swarm of bees

odd man out
the one who would rather
be indoors

weekend gridlock
swearing my way
to paradise

no longer shocking
the threat
of thunderstorms

the echo
in my empty cabinets
more coffee

trying to remember
the haiku i wrote
in a dream

broken and empty
the egg and i

moonlight
in the cemetery
a summer chill

station ghosts
missing
the last train

blown save
hornets rebuild
their nest

truth or dare
an unfiltered ale

empty bar
sharing a beer
with my regrets

double-header
a hangover big enough
for both of us

above the clouds
the places
your kisses take me

a day far too nice
to sit here
and write about it

unable to sleep
a bird that keeps
calling your name

old enough to know
i’m too old for this

on the grill
the old dog’s
new appetite

monday morning
a sympathy letter sent
to the wrong address

hot summer night
a conspiracy
of bullfrogs

my childhood home
a familiar crack
in the sidewalk

in the forecast
bittersweet
climbing the walls

hazy sunshine
the dow
finishes flat

meditation class
they’re all chanting
the same mantra

hazy sunshine
an evolving alibi

hazy night
a lightning bug
becomes a firefly

explaining to my mother
that it’s good
to be a nerd

naked chess
your move
she says

poetry party
here comes the
designated drinker

pop fly
all eyes
on smartphones

tinnitus
the sound i hear
when i want to hear nothing

a rotting tree stump
unwilling
to forgive

heat wave
she stops adjusting
her shoulder strap

searching for a gentle way
to write about the heat

priceless
a pearl
in the deep green sea

fanning myself
with the blank pages
of my haiku notebook

all alone
in the hazy night
crescent moon

summer baseball
reminding myself that beer
is a diuretic

star gazing
a game-winning
home run

man on the moon
too good
to be true

meeting mom’s boyfriend
over baba ghanoush

summer heat
the sultry shadows
of my dreams

windless night
stirring my cocktail
slowly

still of the night
her gentle eyes

heat wave
the dog
licks my face

restless sleep
an old tree
full of kites

summer doldrums
learning the new boss
doesn’t drink

sliver moon
she sleeps
on the train

on every city street
the drum beat
of war

silver spoon
she dreams
of trains

northern lights
late-night traffic
on the pike

locusts
who stole
the summer breeze?

blues in the park
a thrift store
fashion show

summer haze
an abandoned house
with rooms for rent

crescent moon
that look
in her eyes

moving day
did she or did she not
leave the buddha behind?

windless night
a slow dance
of fireflies

locusts
the soundtrack
of summer

gridlock
the taxi driver shuts off
my favorite song

soothing my outrage
this cool
summer breeze

undisputed king
of the neglected garden
tiger lilies

the heat wave breaks
and i dream
about snow

in the news
a fire hose
filled with mud

moonless night
the radio plays
i think we’re alone now

new moon
emptying out
another drawer

new moon
a night
without words

imagining myself
on the other side
of the mirror

summer rain
her face
without makeup

morning darkness
and yet i find
the snooze button

an inside job
leaks
in the basement

monday
feeling the rain
inside

summer rain
i dream of where
the birds are hiding

after the rain
a cloud
of seagulls

dreaming
i woke up
in a clown car

camp meeting tabernacle
a violin sonata
for ghosts

listless in seattle
proof that baseball bats
can suffer jet lag

writer’s block
trying to articulate
overcast

low tide
an unanswered
phone call

crescent moon
i remember
to breathe

down the storm drain
everything i thought i knew
about summer rain

wildflowers
she won’t take no
for an answer

trespassing
kudzu covering
the no

morning glory
a shrimp boat
ties up

the morning after
my good for nothing
lottery ticket

bold and fleeting
this quintessence
of dust

at least they don’t
eat the tomatoes
dust bunnies

second line
grackles
in the freshly mowed grass

wild pitch
a cloud
of chalk dust

eclipse
knowing
who your friends are

today’s headline
whose answered prayer
is this?

rough seas
the black sails
of a ghost ship

summer rain
an exgirlfriend’s
engagement

obsessed with leaks
the plumber’s apprentice

light rain
my thoughts
exactly

light rain
the way she walks
into the room

the good life
finding shade
in the sunroom

moonless night
the telescope
in an empty room

morning meditation
a broken lock
on the closet door

out of service
the stiff breeze
from a passing train

out of service
the subterranean breeze
of a subway train

which part
of partly cloudy
shall i write about?

unhinged
a broken door
to nowhere

pop-up
a catcher’s mask
in foul territory

damned with faint praise
this crescent moon

remembering how
the joke was funnier
when it wasn’t on us

the sound of whispers
police tape
in the wind

dirty politics
it all comes out
in the wash

crescent moon
the dog’s
half-hearted howl

writer’s block
an untethered
fishing boat

how high the moon
the runner tags
and scores

crowded train
the unblinking gaze
of a blind man’s dog

growing taller
the stack of books
i’ve yet to read

day moon
no wonder i’m craving
a beer

writer’s block
a seagull
far from home

roses
an extra bounce
in her step

driving far enough
to flee the sound
of traffic

moving day
whispers
among the reeds

waving to
the new neighbors
blue hydrangeas

hot summer night
baptized
in lust

draining the blood
from tonight’s dinner
a fish out of water

muggy night
the dog’s tongue
hanging out

snap dragon
she’s not
talking to me

stale bread
to toast
or not to toast

feathering their nest
the empty-nesters

in the news
more thunder
without rain

thunder
the dog
shivers

illuminating
my empty bed
summer lightning

lightning
her nightgown
comes off

power outage
and yet
the birds

brown-out
yes men
one by one

desolation peak
the illusion of being
above it all

moving day
just one more box

cranberry bog
i finally
let go

breathless
the disquieting
quiet

street dog
my friend until
the treats run out

blue hydrangeas
when there’s so much
left to do

also enjoying
our new home
a butterfly

blue hydrangeas
when there’s
so far to go

morning fog
birdsong
with the volume down

also not
sleeping in
noisy seagulls

the twinkle
in the bartender’s eye
when i say top shelf

just my luck
caught in 20%
chance of rain

over pancakes
the pros and cons
of flipping a house

our end tables
boxes marked
miscellaneous

the woodpecker knows
no sundays

just offshore
an ominous parade
of dorsal fins

too young to remember
and too old to do
the twist

red moon
the taste
of her lipstick

sturgeon moon
an ancient
burial site

red morning sky
everything
we don’t know

the new house
a seagull sharpens
its beak

will you never
sing for me
saltmarsh sparrow?

military jet
not a ripple
in the river

above the construction din
carolina wren song

it could be a postcard
the sailboat horizon

a rat in a maze
unable to escape
ikea

crossing the bridge
a procession
of motionless windmills

grandma’s vase falling
in
slow
motion

awake too late
the shrouded moon

young sailor
fishing
for compliments

so beautiful
this uncomfortable bed

in an old poem
your young
aching smile

skunky homebrew
he tries to pass it off
as a new style

red moon
an exgirlfriend’s
engagement ring

time stands still
her hourglass figure

sleepless night
a spider
in its web

welcoming us
to our new home
a flock of seagulls

at the end of the day
an unmatched parenthesis

lonely night
i cannot find
the north star

lost
i find
myself

waning moon
counting down
the hours

the look on our faces
when he asks
for documentation

climbing toward
the third rail
bittersweet

church bells
playing a hymn
i don’t recognize

meanwhile on wall street
the s&amp;p falls
down a storm drain

after three days away
the dog greets me
with a yawn

shooting star
the new manager’s
crisp white shirt

upscale market
the organic farmer’s
hipster beard

a tip
for the surly waiter
quit your job

today’s weather
cloudy with a chance
of nuclear war

backyard diplomacy
what is and isn’t
a weed

starless night
striking out
with the bases loaded

stepping on the scale
a heavy sigh

summer rain
awaiting the birth
of my new grandson

caught speeding
the last days
of summer

the long way home
navigating
dangerous curves

moving day
it’s in
the bag

lonely night
even misery
lets me down

in the headlines
any dog can howl
at the moon

amber sky
i put down
my pen

when i finally
let go
the constellations
in the sky

stepping off the scale
i lighten
my memory

waning moon
who cares for
the caregiver?

puppy love
his new favorite
tennis ball

cloudless sky
an osprey nest
in a cell tower

scattered clouds
unable to sleep
or stay awake

when an imminent nuclear war
is the least of our problems

faded paint
where her portrait
used to be

in the news
an elderly couple
watch the sunset

summer cold
somewhere far away
a river flows

the new grandson
an extra star
in the sky tonight

cape weekend
all of the signs reminding me
i’m near the beach

betrayal takes two
burning down
our favorite bar

flirting with a drunk girl
stale peanuts in a dish

cape traffic
everything
that washes ashore

coughing fit
i’ve got to stop
reading the news

mostly cloudy
the cold medicine
wears off

confined to quarters
a penny
for your thoughts

a largemouth bass
still swimming
in the hawk’s talons

the new laptop
voiding another
warranty

overcast
just beneath
the surface

small things
i share a birthday
with napoleon

swift current
trying not to get
carried away

writer’s block
a persistent
head cold

swing and a miss
the fly
gets away

in the highest branches
the faint chanting
of monks

busking for change
the purist
who didn’t sell out

deluxe condos
where the swimming hole
used to be

chance of rain
an unexpected
payroll deduction

against the odds
i buy another
powerball ticket

cape cod rain
looking up the recipe
for a cocktail

knowing how much
summer is left
migrating geese

last days of summer
celebrating
the stillness

distant thunder
we wake
each other up

glaring
the shine
of the politician’s limo

after the rain
new blossoms
on her shopping list

protesting summer
an acorn falls

kissing me in protest
my resistance crumbles

son of immigrants
telling me to go back
where i came from

record humidity
watching
the paint peel

mommy, what’s an activist?
we are.

drift away
remembering where i was
when i heard that song

continental drift
i recycle another
powerball ticket

my endsummer dream
a month of sundays

funeral procession
don’t tell me
it’s only a game

total eclipse
she takes
all the covers

overcast night
just when i needed
to wish on a star

sliver moon
i sleep
alone

morning fog
a memory
i never had

a crow
in the finch feeder
total eclipse

pennies in the fountain
watching the
jackpot rise

always too early
for a pumpkin-flavored beer

total eclipse
a black cat
in the dark

hidden sunlight
choosing the wrong side
of history

back at work
far away
the sun

an uninvited guest
at our picnic
skyscraper shadows

clothed only
in shadow
her silhouette

summer haze
slowly remembering
which bed i’m in

assuming it’s fireworks
i check the locks
just in case

hugging her baby brother
the granddaughter
who won’t let me hug her

moon viewing
turning too quickly
i see stars

late summer dusk
the homecoming queen is using
her maiden name

dark lady
wearing only
the night

the lights go out
she promises to give me
a night to remember

our living room view
the construction crew’s
porta-potty

ignoring google maps
i take the road
less traveled

when nothing else makes sense
the whispering river

asleep on the train
an out-of-work
day trader

landfill buddha
recycles
everything

late for work
my short cut
under construction

fresh off the grill
an overcooked
conspiracy theory

fresh out of the oven
half-baked
conspiracy theories

the song
that plays in my head
when i cross the bridge

back to school
a battle of backpack
superheroes

her love letters
all boxed up
and ready to burn

crescent moon
the river is deeper
than you think

setting sun
the dog fast asleep
on the new couch

her smile
an unexpected
summer rain

evening walk
the shadows
have wings

the anti-hipster
showing off tattoos
he doesn’t have

writer’s block
mouse droppings
in the empty pantry

thunderbolt
the joyous screams
of distant ghosts

tonight’s dinner
something packaged
in a colorful box

summer dusk
the blackbird’s
urgency

writer’s block
where the cherry tree
used to be

writer’s block
when the river i hear
is a droning highway

migrating
without documentation
canada geese

trampled flowers
missing my favorite
rabbit chaser

in a pink princess dress
my granddaughter’s
brand new shiner

cold front
we regroup
under the covers

late summer chill
thirteen men
left on base

dusk
how happy she is
with him

late summer lullaby
a lonely cricket

apache warrior
posing for selfies
at the museum

end of summer
she didn’t even
say goodbye

the way the crow flies
a private stash
of rotting food

counting stars
the eyes that looked
beyond me

late summer chill
a young man’s
obituary

the chill when i remember
i used to jump
from that bridge

always getting
the last word
nightingale

lost at sea
the widow’s
faraway eyes

dreaming they could fly
the birds in the wall

morning thunder
the slam
of the dumpster door

waking from a deep sleep
i correct
the nagging typo

summer haze
where the
time goes

in the forecast
an unrelenting descent
into fog

the lights go out
she promises me
i’ll never forget her

finally hungry enough to cook
i boil the ocean

late summer colors
the first ripe habaneros

total eclipse
the blinding beauty
of her silhouette

ladybug
navigating
the cactus

in a boarded-up house
sparrows build a nest

lost at sea
a weathered tombstone

city junkyard
sparrows bathing
in a hubcap

crowded flea market
face to face
with a plastic buddha

my home town
there’s no
there there

last day of august
the wind becomes
a sigh

at the flea market
antiques
and their wallets

september chill
the shadows
find me

after the rain
a chorus
of bullfrogs

first of september
an acorn falls
on my head

the brave puppy
staring down
a rabbit statue

after the storm
a world
of sand

autumn rain
the hockey prospect’s
obituary

forgetting my password
i cease
to exist

remembering summer
as if
it’s over

now a lovely poem
the broken boat

the tilt of her head
that tells me she knows
i’m watching

heavy rain
the angry
arroyo

death of a poet
my reflection
in a convex mirror

in plain view
the clinic’s
privacy statement

approaching storm
a cloud
of crows

labor day
celebrating
a day off

today’s forecast
the chance of dreaming
dwindles

calling for war
spoiled children
in their castles

landslide
but not the kind
i hoped for

approaching storm
i ignore a call from
a collections agent

back to school
and so much more
to learn

gibbous moon
all that’s left
of summer

september call-ups
the shadows
lengthen

gibbous moon
finding
my other half

remembering when
we could describe the weather
without the word epic

tempest in a teacup
i measured
incorrectly

harvest moon
another
gray hair

end of summer
watching the dow
fall

giving away
my old guitar
no strings attached

work-life balance
the smell of whiskey
on his breath

bending down
to pick up a box
contents marked fragile

barley moon
the sudden urge
to homebrew

over a beer or two
we argue about
nuclear war

always too soon
pumpkin anything

garden center
the unblinking gaze
of buddha

waiting for summer
two adirondack chairs
in the snow

so far
from urban gridlock
the rush
of the river

storm surge
i dissolve
into her

in living color
the storms that
keep me awake
at night

in brilliant color
the storms that
keep me awake
at night

following the weather
the restless churn
in my stomach

autumn
her knowing caress

church steeple
reaching for
the clouds

last days of summer
a spider web
loses its grip

hurricane watch
bright flashes
on tv

gibbous moon
the things that pass
for knowledge

writer’s block
a city
of idle factories

too close for comfort
the dog
on my pillow

too close for comfort
her exotic perfume

still resonating
the haiku
i didn’t write

drunk at the bar
answering a question
no one asked

awake all night
with worry
deadly nightshade

awake all night
deadly nightshade

despite all my worry
the fragrance
of honeysuckle

writer’s block
all roads
impassable

summer’s end
she takes off
her bikini

bloodshot
the eye
of the storm

minor chord
the troubadour
closes his eyes

football season
an armful
of kindling

after the storm
a deafening
silence

after the storm
we learn what powerless
really means

writer’s block
the day i stopped thinking
about the towers

marked as spam
we’re committed
to your security

stealing my thunder
a tropical storm

cloudless sky
the dow soars

private party
an opening
in the fence

unconditional surrender
her bedroom eyes

after the storm
a lavish assortment
of well-wishers

we interrupt this program
for a weatherman
in the rain

she tells me my life
would make for great poetry

gripping the bedpost
i squeeze the last drop
out of summer

when the ghosts at the bar
tell me
i drink too much

waiting for sunset
i rearrange
the poetry magnets

one or two drinks a day
i tell the doctor
already craving a third

throwing shade
at his former team
the retired pitcher

in the fine print
reassurance that this medication
is rarely fatal

quarter moon
my children
and theirs

forever
the time it takes for her
to recognize me

so much depends upon
a star
no one wished upon

empty nesters
all their eggs
in one basket

asking no questions
the river

when the fall colors
are no longer
premature

rip current
i lose my
train of thought

what heaven must be like
an old dog
in the sun

summer overcast
what rhymes
with orange?

morning fog
still not sure about
the new meds

mercury retrograde
the fever breaks

her eyes tell me
i should be looking
at her eyes

showing its claws
a stray cat
who wants to be friends

what’s the hurry?
a box turtle
in the sun

in lieu of flowers
order another round

early sunset
the rookie’s pitch count
rises

rust on rust
the can man’s
bicycle bell

pop fly
canada geese
heading south

pacifists
fighting
for attention

gateway arch
road closed
due to injustice

in the forecast
marsh grass
perfectly still

windless night
the dog knows
we’re leaving

between sets
no one talks
to the band

backyard barbeque
someone asks
for gluten-free options

summer fog
all i needed
to say

approaching storm
magic number 11

crows and geese
a noisy debate
over climate change

summer fog
when you were
only a poem

nor’easter
the quivering
weatherman

conch republic
a shell
of its former self

end of the dog days
cat-tails
in the wind

dog days
the cat-tails
stand still

cloudy skies
locusts take
the night off

storm warning
letting the
sleeping dog lie

after all the words i’ve written
i’ve yet to find
the right one

tracking the storm
bullrushes
form a question mark

full of wine
the soundtrack
of the river

before the fight
the cat’s
wavering tail

hoping no one will miss
a few coins
in the fountain

after the storm
a chainsaw symphony

endsummer dream
a windmill
in the fog

shadowing
our dog walk
a hissing cat

before the first
acorn falls
despair

summer mist
before the first
acorn falls

epic storm
even the ghosts
seek shelter

lost in the toy store
a connection
to childhood

suicide
whispers
in the hallway

fact-check
a waning
crescent moon

scoreless tie
crescent moon
beyond the clouds

end of summer
morning darkness
replaced by rain

lucky this time
the rabbit’s foot
hops away

end of summer
morning darkness
becomes rain

approaching thunder
i forget who told me
the last train had gone

dead dog beach
the storm clouds
darken

equinox
the space
between us

equinox
she says
i complete her

equinox
she completes me

after the storm
the darkness
becomes night

barely mediocre
a beer
called ultra

neither here nor there
what’s left of
my island paradise

neither here nor there
my island paradise

summer’s last stand
a stubborn nor’easter

does the dog believe
i’m not afraid
of the wind?

tilted
at a jaunty angle
an old headstone

some assembly required
a box within a box
within a box

mouse in the wall
seemingly on the verge
of a breakthrough

caught in the sway
of a nor’easter
the old oak

last day of summer
the raging river

first day of fall
and yet too soon
for an oktoberfest

equinox
the same river
from either side

last day of summer
the dog’s
heavy sigh

equinox
we split
the last beer

another day to celebrate
the end of the world

questioning
his patriotism
the draft dodger

after the rain
our empty
wine glasses

first date
the glare
of the porch light

evening walk
the fragrance
of rain

where i once
struck out the side
affordable housing

empty nest
hoping the birds
are safe and sound

now and then i wonder
if our flag
is still there

sometimes i wonder
if our flag
is still there

in my waking dreams
a ladder
to the moon

solving for x
nothing but
irrational numbers

cloudless sky
the last word

all eyes on the dog
two stray cats
in the shade

an empty beach
dream enough
for two

impermanence
if i could save it
in a little box

meanwhile
a forgotten nation
in the dark

peace at last
a dream
about a river

holding back
the dunes
a weary fence

autumn morning
the search for light
beyond the fog

arguing about politics
the blue jay
and me

noisy crows
so many
monday morning quarterbacks

i don’t drink any more
he said.
what’s the point?

longer nights
are you thinking
what i’m thinking?

longer nights
he tells me
the cancer is back

crescent moon
what never
could have been

disappearing into fog
the woman of my dreams

missing the zoo
the din
of late-night traffic

talent magnet
use of salt
is prohibited

no substitute
for the river
mass pike traffic

opening a window
into the sound
of night

heat lightning
when she arches
her back

writer’s block
my least favorite
building material

heat wave
throwing shade
at the weatherman

to shave or not to shave?
my pre-dawn reasoning
with the alarm clock

afternoon sun
i forget where
i parked my car

october
pumpkin
everything

cape cod sunset
a coyote strolling
down the street

red sky at night
i finish
my wine

cold front
her firm
handshake

wondering when
my gray hair
becomes distinguished

wondering
if i’ve already seen
the last firefly

call of the wild
the dog barks
at a coyote

the darkness
at the end
of the tunnel

elevated highway
a squirrel leaps
between trees

a flashback
to when i knelt
for confession

autumn sunset
the river
doesn’t notice

autumn sunset
shadows following
her tantalizing curves

autumn twilight
an old man
bagging leaves

cold front
a weak ground ball
with the bases loaded

in darkness
our moans
become one

sleepless night
counting each acorn
as it falls

sunshower
never quite sure
what’s next

bobbing and weaving
a wild turkey
on main street

a towering pop up
against an amber sky
october baseball

pennant fever
another manager
fired

accepted for publication
a poem i don’t
remember writing

day of atonement
the sin
of forgetting

sleepwalking
an uneven sidewalk
far away

moonless night
a wedding dress
with the tags still on

not an old house
but it has
its secrets

a wine rack he says
when i see a pair of wine boxes
taped together

asking myself
do the gods really drink this?
i tell myself yes
crank the ignition
and drive away

hearing is a sense
listening is a skill
he lectured
ignoring the stop sign

i’ll never use it
but i’ll never throw away
mom’s bright pink plastic
ambrosia mold

city dog
barking at
the silence

autumn chill
telling my granddaughter
that the dead sparrow
is only sleeping

rabbit’s nest
the things you think
are precious

ceiba tree
an old man’s
toothless smile

a recurring nightmare
where every man
is an island

autumn
a rusty
basketball rim

late for dinner
the last chicken
in the shop

finding our cadence
each turn
of the page

every day
a roll
of the dice

in other news
a chipmunk scampering
across the deck

when the light
at the end of the tunnel
is the barrel of a rifle

running for their lives
two gray squirrels
in the tall branches

the bogeyman
who woke up
on the underside
of the bed

warm autumn sun
and yet the chipmunk’s cheeks
full of acorns

meanwhile
a modest rally
on wall street

no one
asks the river
where it’s going

in no particular rush
bulrushes

clothed only
in mystery
the new neighbor

no peace
in these moments
of silence

a tragedy unfolds
but the other window
has a nicer view

the new normal
sleeping under the stars
at home

cold snap
an updated
casualty count

striking the right tone
an acorn
on the roof

waiting for the bus
the wide-eyed naivete
of freshmen

morning meditation
my screaming hangover

tuesday
an empty
passenger train

last call
lone wolves
in unison

fall colors
high school girls
with too much lipstick

gibbous moon
a longing
to be whole again

abandoned island
i never stopped
loving you

twin babies
in harmony

facing away
from the light
a plastic plant

fallen leaves
in the water
under the bridge

endless summer
beach sand
in my jacket pocket

endless summer
a bikini-clad
daydream

starless night
a metaphor
for nothing

autumn
the sepia tones
of an old photograph

without emotion
someone’s child
and a gun

falling leaves
there is never
enough time

harvest moon
emptying
my spam folder

harvest moon
waiting for the fundraiser
to end

harvest moon
she buys me
a drink

harvest moon
two skinny dippers
in love

church bells
dancing on
the autumn wind

my waking dream
crossing the bridge
into windmills

harvest moon
i finish my wine
too quickly

morning meditation
someone’s
annoying ringtone

morning fog
i clutch my coffee
tightly

a cellphone
my mantra
through gritted teeth

elevator down
stepping into
someone’s fart

post-season baseball
but scant evidence
of an offense

under an electric sun
three scantily clad
barbie dolls

ain’t too proud to beg
another npr fundraiser

big sky
the miles
between us

city boy
lost
in the milky way

so much dark sky
when the wine glass
runs empty

the scripted speech
a dog barking
at its own echo

empty chairs
no time to watch
the changing colors

in my dream
an old ghost
hitching a ride

cranberry bog
the weight lifting
from my shoulders

sniper fire
another acorn
hits the sunroof

evening dog walk
the smell
of the ocean

walking on air
chinese lanterns
in the sky

backs against the wall
the street punks
we’ll never be

dancing in the treetops
the smell of rain

in slow motion
the dog
stalks a woodchuck

discovering america
another violent storm

festival of lights
when no words
are necessary

serenity
smiling
in the cold rain

death
by hanging
curve ball

broken clouds
living to see
another day

end of the weekend
evening fog
settling in

restless night
i put on my watch
upside-down

holding pattern
the over-friendly skies

columbus day
an unlocked door

columbus day
discovering
each other

commuter nightmare
a traffic circle
that never ends

changing colors
we ask each other
if we have a snow shovel

before and after
the fundraiser
santa rosa burns

batting practice
never the autograph
i wanted

holiday traffic
the race
to anonymity

early october
winter begins
at fenway park

daydreaming
everywhere
the river flows

bending my ear
the people who keep telling me
i should do yoga

writer’s block
so much to learn
from the pine

a deep breath
for no reason
except to breathe

my retirement fund
a forgotten island

investment strategies
a child’s balloon
floats away

not far above the clouds
a lingering threat
of war

change of seasons
the manager cleans out
his office

retirement dreams
a dog naps
in a patch of sun

yellow leaves
the countdown
to next year

waning moon
the girl next door
walks by

waning moon
still trying to see
a way forward

when all else fails
the waning moon

the backyard buddha’s
graceful stillness

frost advisory
he refuses
to dye his hair

frost advisory
wiping the smile
from my face

off-season
when you’re still not
a local

waiting room
repeating patterns
in the fake wood

friday the thirteenth
a black cat in front of
the white house

friday the thirteenth
the black cat’s reflection
in a broken mirror

closer than it seems
a blip
on the radar

friday the thirteenth
why not buy
a powerball ticket?

autumn sunset
when i know she’s not
waiting for me

dating website
how did her profile photo
get so young?

earlier sunsets
the promises no one
wants to keep

through an open window
the restless night

open window
the restless night

moved from its corner
a triggered mouse trap

rainy saturday
disappointed scavengers
at the give-and-take pile

fall reflections
when does drizzle
turn to mist?

the way she lingers
when she knows
i’m watching

always smiling
suburban scarecrow

off-season
an empty
bird feeder

blue jay
calling
to itself

autumn rain
the color
of leaves

writer’s block
an oyster
that won’t open

writer’s block
an untethered boat

mid-day fog
wishing i could forget
what day it was

autumn wind
the drunken
church bells

autumn wind
how quickly
we forget

tonight’s soundtrack
wave after wave
of seaborne wind

wave after wave
of seaborne wind

autumn wind
when life’s too good
to watch tv

cold morning
blankets in the shape
of a dog

busy chipmunk
wondering where all
the acorns go

overcast
trying to remember
when it wasn’t

end of the line
the train conductor
taps my shoulder

killing frost
just one glance
at the news

sickle moon
the harvest
of venus

morning meditation
dark shadows
in a conference room

following the instructions
frost forms
on a fallen leaf

sliver moon
my eyes
at half-mast

windless night
the future
of our ashes

how it sparkles
their unused pool

autumn sunset
shadows disappear
into themselves

the sun so low
my shadow
can’t see it

autumn wind
when the leaf blower
gets too close

new moon
an old sea shanty
as an instrumental

new moon
the old dog’s
matted fur

new moon
another call
from a collection agent

new moon
hoping i see
tomorrow

new moon
every touch
and taste
of you

dancing by firelight
i follow
her lead

new moon
a bull wandering
the streets of brooklyn

summer morning
the cat’s
sandpaper tongue

taking a walk
to clear my head
i find nothing there

before sunrise
the tired drone
of a leaf blower

24-hour news
a smouldering
brush fire

my reward
has arrived
in my spam folder

over cold coffee
the grounds
for impeachment

sitting on a park bench
the sign on the ground reads
wet paint

outside the liquor store
an old dog
in the driver’s seat

cloudless sky
settling into
a comfortable routine

stagnant water
i walk the dog
alone

the news from wall street
another shooting star

graveyard shift
there is
no tomorrow

first light
the slam
of a dumpster

brisk autumn night
i remember
to breathe

between stops
the conductor collects
himself

needing no introduction
he makes one anyway
chickadee

dreaming
it’s only
a dream

rush hour
the busker
takes requests

in my sleep
i’m finally safe
from my daydreams

good news
all tests
are negative

changing colors
158 days
to the season opener

unseasonably warm
the girl who never
says hello

lingering
among golden leaves
the fragrance of summer

young love
the taste
of candy

peace at last
the old boat
free of its moorings

yellow leaves
still struggling
to let go

already fading
this perfect sunset

in the ruins
of a beach house
wild orchids bloom

oktoberfest
in and out
of focus

in the news
a dog urinating
on the palace steps

freshly cut grass
the smell
of rain

in a daydream
i am sleepwalking

keyless entry
a cinder block
through the windshield

fall color
brake lights
in a construction zone

finding that place
where the sighs
become song

overnight rain
wondering what else
i’ve missed

fouling the air
unfiltered
conversation

too weary to sleep
autumn rain

town meeting
the strangers
who represent us

overnight rain
i forget
where i am

autumn overcast
a young man’s
obituary

approaching storm
the eaves whistle

turning off the game
the sound
of rain

morning hangover
a cloud in the shape
of a fist

overcast
withdrawing my support
for natural causes

right where i left them
an unopened packet
of wildflower seeds

autumn rain
soaking in
the darkness

morning gridlock
the clouds that keep me
from sunrise

autumn twilight
that part of the movie
when my eyes wander

autumn twilight
when there’s nothing left
to write

careful not to wish
happy birthday
to a dead facebook friend

surrounding
the peaceful protester
riot police

candlelight shadows
a crack
in the popcorn ceiling

scarecrow
waving his arms
at the wind

final frame
i pick up
the wrong bowling ball

crossing the bridge
a craving for
too many oysters

cloudless sky
the futility
of it all

fallen leaves
a clear view
of the neighbors

what’s the rush?
i ask the river

across the ocean
a valley
with my name on it

at the end of the bar
me
in ten years

la madrugada
the shadows discover
themselves

crudely photoshopped
out of an exgirlfriend’s
facebook profile

what’s that sound?
wishing i hadn’t said
i was the outdoor type

mums
silenced
by frost

setting off
the smoke detector
those eyes

autumn twilight
who will mourn
the fallen scarecrow?

late autumn
reacquainting ourselves
with darkness

late october
old and cranky
no one asks me
what i’m wearing
for halloween

craving a snack
the vending machine
eats my dollar

quiet river
a leaf floats past
my reflection

window seat
a canopy
of clouds

your trembling skin
on the tip
of my tongue

taking center stage
an old man wearing
lots of product

handing me the bill
he keeps calling me
boss

in the midst of the storm
buddha remains
unmoved

putting on my sunglasses
the sky darkens

heavy sigh
gibbous moon
in a mud puddle

ten months later
we’re the first ones
with christmas lights

before i could
celebrate summer
bare trees

devil’s night
the ghostly glow
of 24-hour news

devil’s night
talking heads
on fire

downed power lines
the restless crows

halloween morning
little devils
at the bus stop

halloween decorations
the devil’s
in the details

halloween morning
the pumpkin-colored sky

gibbous moon
my vegan son

don’t worry about ghosts
in this old mining town
they work very quietly

fair-weather clouds
my retirement portfolio

trick or treat
her sexy
devil costume

halloween shadows
ghosts and goblins
door to door

day of the dead
game 7
at chavez ravine

sirens
a chill
in the air

day of the dead
i am stretched
on your grave

the morning after
bright sunshine
on a battered pier

day of the dead
my unshaved face
in the mirror

day of the innocents
reminding myself
she’s too young for me

waiting for the dentist
a bowl of leftover
halloween candy

writer’s block
downed power lines
on a dead-end street

crime scene
a distracted
white house

feel-good ending
the perfect
french fry

feel-good ending
the perfect
hair gel

pay day
the squirrel’s mouth
full of acorns

stuck behind a school bus
an empty cup
of coffee

day of the dead
we’ve run out
of coffee

stuck in traffic
the laughter
of crows

oars still in their mounts
the dinghy
he named after her

day of the dead
a flower garden
buried under leaves

fading into
the pale
of morning

steeling his nerves
the old fisherman
who can barely stand

between catheter commercials
live footage
of the hurricane

morning fog
stepping over
a whiskey bottle

thinking green
a recycled
lottery ticket

brown leaves
clinging
to the past

young love
collapsing
into a sigh

autumn sunset
the blush
of our wine glasses

shots fired
an acorn
on the roof

turning a page
in her romance novel
the tamale lady

airsick
from a tequila flight

autumn blush
we’re pretty sure we gave them
our housewarming gift

taking the warmth
out of our fire
the carbon monoxide detector

hunter’s moon
unable to find
my cellphone

a pause
in the conversation
we’re not having
about mom

her lips so close
i can taste
their secrets

beaver moon
when did we get
so busy?

ocean wind
a pelican plunges
into whitecaps

ocean sunset
a lonely stretch of beach
and you

fallen leaves
watching the neighbor
watch us

hunter’s moon
exactly what
i was looking for

waning gibbous moon
the lonely drive home

retirement planning
a roll
of the dice

not a terrorist
a white man
with an assault rifle

lonely night
the moon hides
above the clouds

turning the clocks back
a favorite shirt
no longer fits

taking my breath away
the next-door neighbor
sneaks a cigarette

early sunset
the twinkle
in the bartender’s eye
when i ask
what’s on cask?

suspension of belief
the other side
of the bridge

still chasing paper
in paradise

cloudy afternoon
lonelier
than a park bench

a dog on the beach
chasing the gulls
into oblivion

vieques sunset
where have all
the wild horses gone?

early sunset
it doesn’t take long
to get old

heavy sigh
more leaves
on a freshly raked lawn

a sudden chill
the mere mention
of snow

preparing for take-off
a kestrel
on the hunt

election day
and no one
to vote for

cool autumn night
have we seen
the last firefly?

over burnt coffee
the wait
for election results

280 characters
of sound and fury
signifying nothing

after the rain
it’s all water
under the bridge

startled from sleep
the last ferry
leaves port

selling their own merch
the aspiring dive bar

writer’s block
the mere mention
of snow

fallen leaves
congratulating an ex
on her engagement

autumn morning
opening the door
to fog

lonely night
an empty chair
by the fire

barking at the moon
what a dog believes

record cold
i dream
of crickets

words
how quickly everything
becomes night

morning meditation
steam rises
from a storm drain

veteran’s day
losing count of all the wars
in my lifetime

veteran’s day
a draft dodger
in the white house

sharing
my solitaire victory
with no one

the leaf blower reminds me
that the snow blower
isn’t far behind

loud and clear
the osprey nest
in a cellphone tower

cold front
she sees me
noticing her nipples

their turn in the sun
bulrushes
at twilight

reaching
for the remote
we touch

autumn sunset
letting the train
go by

in a dream
my favorite chair
beneath the old oak

is it time for a fire?
sunlit autumn leaves

beckoning me
the road
less traveled

cleaning my sunglasses
a morning without fog

writer’s block
leaves plugging up
the storm drain

the politician’s speech
cold coffee
down the drain

lulling me to sleep
the restless river

autumn sunset
when my grandson is too old
for toys

today’s news
calling a spade
a diamond

killing frost
the hydrangeas’
last stand

told i’m a poet
he recites a limerick
about nantucket

table for two
her eyes
far away

cold snap
the sound of stepping
on a twig

jealous
of the cotton robe
that hugs you

pocket change
everything
that makes me angry

ice in an overflowing gutter
my to-do list
overflowing

clinging to the old oak
brittle brown leaves
and me

the old house
when we stopped asking
where the noises come from

winterizing
so many uses
for the yoga mats

deep autumn
when to break out
the winter jacket

autumn chill
where the moon goes
at night

overcast morning
the glass of wine
i shouldn’t have had

stuck in traffic
a deer
who won’t run

autumn rain
my coffee
grows cold

autumn rain
i should have worn
my winter jacket

frozen in time
miss january

crescent moon
an old woman
winks at me

late autumn
the color
of night

my disappointment
when the winter jacket
still fits

first snow
a flood
of brake lights

first snow
my third cup
of bad coffee

slithering through
the marsh grass
a poacher’s lantern

cold to the touch
grandma’s walker

church cemetery
old tombstones leaning
to the right

autumn wind
wondering when
hurricane season ends

the answer
to every question
beyond the sand dune

restless night
the noises
i can’t hear

a new normal
when no one notices
the dumpster fire

from our oceanside window
the fishing boat’s
weathered hull

when i know i shouldn’t tell you
you were in my dream
last night

an empty wine bottle
the best i’ve felt
all day

sleepless
the night

unripe pomegranates
all that’s left
between us

winning a pinky bet
my granddaughter
paints my nails

in my nightmare
voices
among the embers

mother always
called me a winner
but that powerball ticket
tells me otherwise

tossing and turning
an ocean wave
far away

sailing past
an abandoned lighthouse
the ghost ship

that moment you realize
it’s a permanent marker

road rage
an angry
old engine

the question of consent
a dog
chasing a squirrel

morning commute
a flock of geese
in perfect formation

slow dance
when the music
is over

rough surf
the summer cottage’s
mossy roof

slow dance
when the music’s over

if my mother
was on twitter
why can’t you retweet
something nice?

where i expected
her phosphorescent glow
an empty cubicle

overcast
another night
without dreams

hiding in the darkness
by simply standing still

silencing
the opposition
a red-tailed hawk

a new low
the deepest part
of the lake

a drunkard’s peace
empty kegs
outside the brewery

watching the clouds
the shape
of my heart

to a near-empty crowd
the singer-songwriter’s
overflowing heart

the ghosts
waiting for me
at the end of the road

new moon
the mannequin’s
empty gesture

the final glow
when we both know
it’s over

the sky so empty
when i want
to cry

autumn morning
the gray
in my dog’s muzzle

remembering a time
when it didn’t look like
it was about to rain

screaming
into the night
an ambulance

thunderstorm
comforting
the assistance dog

new moon
an empty sky

clutching the walker
the fear of going
to a home

new moon
so many ways
to say nothing

searching for the words
the sparks
from a welder’s torch

cold front
she has
a headache

new moon
a deer who knows
i don’t have a gun

moonless night
wondering where
the words go

new moon
the beauty of
the crushing darkness

in a half-empty coffee house
a lonely heart breaks
again

eruption
a dog chasing seagulls
on the beach

a twitter morning
living to lie
another day

cold front
no i don’t need
new wiper blades

sliver moon
the last slice
of pie

black coffee
the car mechanic’s
fingernails

thanksgiving week
once again i’m taken
for a turkey

crescent moon
headlights
in a distant parking lot

windmills
to be
a child again

refreshing my browser
i’m angry again

too early for bed
i dream
of sleeping

under the christmas tree
everything we want
to believe

sad song
willow branches touching
the bare ground

the spark
in her eyes
when she’s texting

thanksgiving week
the old man reeks
of wild turkey

hazy sunrise
not her first
walk of shame

chasing darkness
the assassin’s bullet

in the zen garden
old graffiti
undisturbed

thanksgiving traffic
a snail climbs
mount fuji

where the buddha once sat
a fat gray squirrel

morning stillness
every little girl’s
first boyfriend

peace on earth
staying away
from a holiday gathering

autumn leaves
the sound
of rain

family time
a gathering
of turkeys

thanksgiving tax-cut
the plumpest turkeys
get all the trimmings

black friday
a crow
in the rain

silencing
the leaf blowers
late autumn rain

fourteen years later
barbed wire
and broken promises

remembering
where i was
the day
camelot died

hgtv drinking game
a shot each time we hear
granite counter-tops

thanksgiving dinner
my vegetarian daughter
bakes a pie

a quiet thanksgiving
all of the empty chairs
at the table

holiday shopping
a crowded
website

pointing
a turkey leg at me
he says
i disagree
with your politics

thanksgiving dinner
the old dog
watches football

black friday
a murder of crows
in a dead oak tree

black friday
the bright red brake lights
surrounding the mall

black friday
a night
without words

waxing crescent moon
i finish
another book

river delta
i pull myself
together

thanksgiving eve
my mother wishes me
merry christmas

expecting company
the breeze
through an open window

acclimating to darkness
the colors of night

dancing lights
when the meds
kick in

stink bug
i don’t care
what it’s really called

shorter days
we run out of words
too quickly

starless night
too dark to make
sense of it all

restless night
a dog toy
in our bed

last of the wine
never enough time
to drink it all in

feeling
tomorrow’s rain
the arroyo

long weekend over
i surrender
to the wind

today’s high
an osprey nest
in the church steeple

long weekend over
the wind takes
my sigh away

bowing in unison
bare trees
in the wind

its letters worn off
fresh flowers
beside the tombstone

dead butterfly
a candidate
i can trust

morning thunder
the garbage man’s
early start

stepping into the salt marsh
another lost hiker

old house
the footsteps
of ghosts

mouse droppings
a reminder that
i’m not alone

keep hope alive
please tell me it’s more
than a song

arpeggio
the music
of rain

always persistent
the cold
winter rain

tundra
nothing else
on the page

a stranger with poor grammar
offers me a pill
that will change my life

i never knew why
they called it a harp
until the band grew quiet
and he played a solo
that took

cold snap
my mandatory
retirement date

feeling old
a new wrinkle
on my face

washed ashore
the ghost ship
of my dreams

missile test
another acorn falls

when she’s too young
to know
how young she is

hiding in plain sight
the cardinal
in a bare tree

scrambled eggs
i balance
my checkbook

deer tick
trying to get
under my skin

closing up
their tidy houses
migrating snowbirds

warming trend
the nasdaq
falls

how low can you go?
a limbo dance
with two right feet

drawbridge
refusing to lower
my standards

the bad coffee
i can’t
stop drinking

approaching clouds
i preferred
yesterday’s
horoscope

bare trees
a deeper darkness

autumn twilight
the throbbing bass line
from spoonful

deep twilight
the throbbing bass line
from spoonful

crossing the bridge
a field
of windmills

half asleep
i explain zen
to ghosts

an unfinished building
where the river
used to be

though brittle and brown
the oak won’t give up
its leaves

remembering
when the sunshine
was enough

blustery wind
the politician’s
angry denial

a stranger’s whisper
nobody lives
in this part of town

autumn sunset
i ask her to run
away with me

the color of the sky
where the river
meets the sea

today’s headline
how the west
was lost

longer nights
my mother asks
where i’m spending christmas

in a convex mirror
my widening
world view

why so angry?
a leaf blower
at dawn

what’s truly important
bare branches
in the wind

approaching winter
a rich old man
who can’t spare a dime

explaining to the children
what a fallout shelter is

sound and fury
pushing the leaves
from here
to there

cold coffee
they told me it would be
a sunny day

falling
into despair
the last leaf

explaining to my grandchildren
what democracy was

super moon
objects are smaller
than they appear

trickle-down economy
a stray dog drinking
from a puddle

unmoved
beneath a pile of leaves
backyard buddha

tired of arguing
the dog’s head
on my lap

keep the faith
he says
to the atheist

shedding no new light
advent candles

morning begins
another leaf
on the perfect lawn

after bruce cockburn
the trouble with normal
it always gets worse

low tide
one seagull
replaces another

woodpeckers
answering
the silence

feigning patience
an old man
with nowhere to go

bare trees
the politics
of stillness

waiting for me
waiting for all of us
cold moon

oak moon
it shines
right through me

always waiting for me
the old lighthouse

ice moon
when there’s nothing left
to say

turning off the radio
when i hear
what doesn’t kill you

overcast night
a black cat
in a coal mine

full moon
the dog barks
at a concrete rabbit

shorter days
i reason with
the alarm clock

late autumn
when we thought
it couldn’t get darker

beyond the double doors
a wave of polite applause

zen garden
any time
i close my eyes

after the fall
i count
every step

autumn mist
nearly forgetting
how old i am

morning silence
the vague assurance
i’m better off

left-wing conspiracy
the other chicken wing
is gone

the tree
where we carved our initials
engulfed in flames

cloudless night
my dreams
escape orbit

cold moon
the former prospect
placed on waivers

empty shopping mall
a skip
in the christmas music

in the headlines
a day that will live
in infamy

christmas music
the inevitability
of snow

late autumn dream
putting the leaves
back on the trees

approaching solstice
i remember daylight

at work after midnight
the uncomfortable silence

always slightly
off-balance
my checkbook

winter weather advisory
stocking up
on summer dreams

snow in the air
the blackening sky

snow in the air
the sky
turns black

christmas spirit
a dead tree
tied to a car roof

democracy in action
burning his image
in effigy

over beer and oysters
the one
that got away

first snow
telling my father
how old he is

rolling thunder
a snowplow
paid by the job

first snow
the christmas lights
brighten

wild fire
the conversation shifts
to politics

solitaire
when i win
i lose

dog breath
the things i remember
before i die

suspension of belief
restless water
under the bridge

fresh snow
the same
old poem

caught up
in the season
freshly fallen snow

empty dive bar
the jukebox plays
born under a bad sign

chasing the pickup truck
sparks
from a cigarette

so many
invisible worlds
beyond our reach

freezing rain
i’ve run out
of words

filling my bucket list
all the places
i’ll never visit

mixed precipitation
a road
no one travels

mixed precipitation
i don’t know
what it means

page not found
the other side
of the bridge

solstice
my late grandfather’s
shadow

outside the white house
a troubadour plays
instant karma

wintery mix
a police siren
and christmas carols

open house
the thrill
of the hunt

cold front
i decline
a senior discount

puppy videos
if you can’t
say anything nice

pale winter sky
they all have
my eyes

only a memory
even his happy songs
are sad today

fuel for the fire
a 5-page resume

christmas cacophony
the mall speakers blaring
silent night

deep winter
this fear
of emptiness

the river
restlessly
demanding
nothing

festival of lights
checks cashed
24 hours a day

christmas party
putting away
the mistletoe

snow showers
wondering
what i’ve forgotten

class in session
i daydream about
session ales

net neutrality
the fisherman’s
confused expression

fresh snow
the dog
takes flight

existential crisis
an empty
infinity pool

dirty snow
an undelivered
christmas card

is this the real life?
falling asleep
in a comfortable chair

ice storm
a mother’s
hysterical phone call

the untold story
whose tiny footprints
in the lonely snow?

snowbound
head bowed against
a quiet window

local dive
the hush
when we walk in

today’s headline
shouting at snowflakes
from a penthouse suite

old cemetery
no one complaining
about the snow

a fishing boat returns
to the adulation
of seagulls

too cold to be angry
the river
and me

drifting snow
sending christmas cards
to my children

writer’s block
when the snow’s not
going anywhere

in the mail
another discount
i can’t use

rabbit hole
what a fool
believes

the new tv
contents damaged
during shipment

winter fever
her silhouette
at twilight

light-headed
when i hear footsteps
in the snow

light-headed
footsteps
in the snow

snow flurries
an easy friend

new moon
some face time
with the boss

clinging to my clothes
the hair of the dog
that bit me

new moon
another drinking buddy
on the wagon

solstice
don’t tell me the darkness
isn’t forever

moonless night
the urge
to be alone

time travel
if only for
grandma’s

lost in the fire
the words
i should have said

lighting a cigarette
the reason i don’t
have a tattoo

new moon
bare branches
touching darkness

new moon
an exgirlfriend wishes me
happy birthday

overcast
another unread newspaper
in the driveway

black ice
even the trees
tread softly

new moon
the night belongs
to crows

black ice
congress rushes
to pass a law

dirty snow
the devils
in the detail

full of stories
the empty boat

solstice
the things that go missing
while we sleep

under the christmas tree
a festive mouse

winter overcast
the dog doesn’t know
it’s our last walk

white man’s totem pole
a stack of empty
budweiser cans

longest night
the silent telephone

longest night
the silence

first day of winter
a distant daydream
of cicadas

a sipping whiskey
the bartender says
two seconds too late

riding into the sunset
christmas traffic

longest night
a disconnected
cell phone

out of gas
a driverless car

tinnitus
i pretend to hear
cicadas

awakening
to your naked body
in the hungry darkness

overcast night
still searching for
a shooting star

winter cocktail
an extra dash
of bitters

overcast
when someone asks
if we have backups

rabbit
wondering how i knew
where he was hiding

descending the escalator
a cascade
of last-minute shoppers

winter beach walk
a lonely old shipwreck

not ready for resolutions
a cheap bottle
of champagne

solstice
darkness
beats me home

driving past a church
the bells’
distorted sound

icing on the cake
snow changes over
to freezing rain

winter fog
the windshield
glazes over

fire and ice
the sunset
after the storm

silent night
a winter
power outage

christmas eve
a hawk
on the highest treetop

happy holidays
i stand
corrected

drifting snow
my sentiments
exactly

christmas snow
if only
it shoveled itself

dna analysis
the tightness
in my genes

christmas greetings
i tell each brother
about the other

christmas cheer
no assembly required
for grandpa

karaoke bar
where old songs
go to die

countdown to spring
my granddaughter’s
green eyes

cold snap
stepping
on a twig

bitter cold
a crow’s echo

boxing day
recycling
the gift boxes

new england
733 haiku
about snow

bitter cold
i give the homeless man
my last dollar

looking for the glue
to keep it together

one last bite
of next year’s
resolution

epiphany
a restaurant
that serves

deep freeze
a flickering
christmas light

writer’s block
shaving with
a dull blade

bitter wind
never quite getting
the message

bitter cold
another squeaking
floorboard

gibbous moon
the fullness
of her lips

taking the plunge
our overnight temperatures

i know it can’t be
too cold to snow
and yet

rocks and salt
another
new england winter

bitter cold
the secrets
the river
will never tell me

dividing by five
a flash
of lightning

bitter cold
a plume of smoke
from an empty building

downtown
the facade of
an invisible building

summer dreams
the organ plays
take me out to the ballgame

unlike me
the river is too swift
to freeze

winter fever
dreaming the bulrushes
are palm branches

unwilling
to accept correction
the spellchecker

winter twilight
a crow’s shadow

record cold
which is why
there is hot sauce

three dog night
but one
will have to do

how old was i
when i started to feel
so old?

winter nightmare
an open window
hours away

getting its
ducks in a row
the icy river

new year’s eve
the countdown
to broken resolutions

new year’s eve
the dog waits
for the tennis ball
to drop

overnight snow
the light froth
of a cappuccino

as i get older
no problem forgetting
old acquaintances

found
among the ruins
an open door

zen poetry
when my words
mean nothing

cold moon
a stranger tells me
i drink too much

new year’s resolutions
a frozen koi pond

cold sky
a towering
smokestack

january morning
resolutions
jog on by

new year’s brunch
resolutions optional

frozen river
embracing
the silence

stepping away
from the fire
a cold draft
finds me

wolf moon
the weekend
isn’t over

super moon
an imperial stout

wolf moon
i know her eyes
are hiding something

snow in the air
it takes so long
to fall

super moon
we shouldn’t have
stayed out
so late

empty nesters
all their eggs
in different baskets

navigating
the frozen river
a narrow trickle

meteor shower
things are
looking up

blizzard warning
wishing i hadn’t seen
that black cat

fourth quarter earnings
another blast
of arctic air

a rave review
for my acid house
mix cd

resolutions
a frozen
cranberry bog

frozen sky
and somehow the days
are lengthening

wolf moon
two unblinking eyes
staring at me

in the forecast
historic heights
of hyperbole

winter commute
shuffling past
yesterday’s footprints

in the waiting room
empty couches
facing one another

in the exam room
a pair of rubber gloves
trying to escape the box

wind chill advisory
a past-due notice

a happy ending
the snowman’s
lemon wedge smile

a world away
my granddaughters
dressed like butterflies

gibbous moon
a mouse foraging
in the trash

snowbound
a different interpretation
of netflix and chill

snowbound
bringing new meaning
to netflix and chill

barefoot in the snow
when the final word
is written

regrets
what the snow plow
left behind

cursing the streetlight
that shows the snow
still falling

distant snow plow
rescue me
from this silence!

day moon
always wondering
what time it is

like a playground swing
an old oak
in the wind

year of the dog
a paw print
on my pillow

frigid night
i forget how
to play chess

getting old
i can’t believe
how early it is

cryptocurrency
my empty pockets

deep winter chill
the cry of a hawk
from a bare tree

greeting me
at the front door
a cruel wind

my winter shadow
not as tall
as i thought it was

countdown to pay day
the last of the soup

snowdrift
envisioning
her curves

epiphany
the emperor should always
wear clothes

epiphany
a pile
of christmas trees

epiphany
one hand always
on the handrail

reaching for her latte
the pale white girl’s
tribal tattoo

cold stethoscope
another conversation begins
at your age

freshly plowed parking lot
the fragrance of diesel

record cold
with no one out
to cheer it

energy dip
and a bag
of chips

black ice
the crunch
of road salt

too late
for happy hour
the bartender’s frown

rush hour
the billboard model
frowns at me

light snow
the dow
also falls

warming trend
i fight off
a fever

warming trend
my cheeks flush
with fever

writer’s block
a stuffy nose

shivering
my reflection
in the snowmelt

mercury retrograde
still writing the previous year
on my checks

in the news
a mouse trap
snaps

wanting to go out
and then immediately back in
the dog days of winter

half moon
i don’t realize
i’m coughing

melting snow
the mere mention
of baseball

the mechanic
hitching
a ride

over death metal
a selection
of herbal teas

flood watch
my runny nose

sea ice
i order
a second cocktail

dreaming of the day
i flew too close
to the sun

taxes due
an empty bottle
of wine

twilight sleep
an early dose
of nyquil

flood watch
my old jeans
come up short

changing the subject
waning crescent moon

scattering doves
the roar
of a fighter jet

melting snow
whether or not
i have the patience

consenting adults
jupiter keeps company
with mars

still resting up
my exercise
resolutions

now cracks
a noble heart
their beloved cat

winter fog
i envy
its stillness

approaching storm
our sighs
deepen

slow soaking rain
a meeting
that never ends

winter rain
pausing
mid-conversation

winter daydream
crossing the bridge
into fog

she doesn’t know
she’s too young
to have that look

six years later
the same surprise
that i’m me

stuck behind a school bus
a cold cup
of coffee

flash freeze
walking past
yesterday’s footprints

pine needles
clinging
to the christmas tree

bitter wind
how easy it is
to fall

bitter cold
bad news
from far away

fever dream
a rooftop concert
at sunset

h1 gridlock
missile alert in error
there is no threat

country road
careful not to watch
the chain gang

winter morning
waking to the news
that it wasn’t a dream

morning haze
knowing when
to call it rain

above the bare treetops
the haiku
i didn’t write down

remembering the night
we didn’t land
on the moon

monday morning quarterback
realizing
it’s sunday

ignorance is bliss
a dog
in the sun

it all makes sense
shadows
on the moon

the passive voice
misused

the wellness center
where the book store
used to be

hearts everywhere
my granddaughter’s
crayon self-portrait

snow showers
leaving the house
without my mind

snow showers
there is
no sky

hanging my winter gloves
on the crescent moon

winter forecast
the grim reaper
cracks a smile

hipster farmer
reaping
what he sows

years after his death
the birthday wishes
on his facebook page

all by myself
on a crowded train

melting snow
that hot
red dress

sad news
i don’t want to
let it linger

always watching me
a well-meaning
algorithm

waning moon
as if i’m running
out of time

blurred horizon
that first murmur
of light

on the wagon
only my most
fragile toys

snow in the forecast
adding insult
to injury

snow in the forecast
she asks me when i started
turning gray

blurred horizon
that first glimmer
of light

nibbling at the bait
he tells another
knock-knock joke

beach erosion
i forget what summer
feels like

100 spam messages
telling me
i’m their type

lost
in the falling snow
birdsong

new moon
the feeling i’ve written
this poem before

vacation plans
putting the cart
before the horse

on the wagon
careful not to put the cart
before the horse

moonless night
what am i supposed to
write about?

soft music
i’ve missed
my train

winter sun
shedding light
on dirty snow

in harm’s way
the rabbit nest
at the dog park

sun-bleached
his royal pine
air freshener

clear skies
the politician’s
bold denial

day thunder
the dog chases sparrows
from the tree

because
the cold
winter rain

tide pool
we’re getting warmer

tide pool
the things
we leave behind

crescent moon
barely able to keep
my eyes open

fresh snow
a path
in the woods

church bells
a hymn
i don’t recognize

every winter
the winter
of our discontent

river’s edge
i have
no secrets

tarot card readings
closed due to
unforeseen circumstances

on the white house lawn
children throwing snowballs

one year later
wiping the mud
from a protest sign

factory shutdown
the smokestacks
darken

writer’s block
i enter
airplane mode

one year later
a weathered
cactus flower

caressing her shoulders
the lazy twilight

food shopping
what is and isn’t
out of season

late-night radio
the shadows
are listening

daily prompt
unfavorable omens
in the sky

winter stillness
the thermostat
kicks on

scattered daylight
struggling to remember
a dream

morning meditation
yesterday’s music
in my ears

beaver dam
wondering how we’ll pay
our property taxes

a hole in the roof
so you can see heaven
the realtor says

the wait for liberty
longer for some
than others

my life’s story
an oak leaf
spinning in a puddle

sunday night
and i’m beginning to hear
the river

her contented smile
she’s using again
he says

lingering showers
and yet i have to
go to work

facing winter
a slippery slope

not to be trusted
the motionless scorpion

song of winter
a cacophony
of coughs

freezing rain
i wonder how
i’ll sleep tonight

overcast sky
an empty promise

vip seating
the dog
beside the fire

miles away
her ashes
on the windless shore

greeting me at the door
the dog yawns

not the outerwear
i had in mind
a coat of ice

snowmelt
the wilderness trail
disappears

slow rain
a cigarette burns down
to the filter

working late
i trip over
the root password

celebrating victory
fans set a police car
on fire

morning commute
slipping into something
less comfortable

cold and clear
how i like
my moonshine

that recurring dream
where she doesn’t make
the last train

trapped on the subway
a child’s balloon

deep winter
the dog chases
dust bunnies

cold snap
the dirty snow
left behind

quarter moon
the weed dealer’s
bicycle helmet

the jagged sky
totally wired
on cold coffee

beyond the bare trees
a coy moon

ice shanty
the buzz of a
transistor radio

continued cold
everything finding
my cracked cuticle

winter gray
the piercing cry
of a hawk

mid-winter
wondering which way
the geese are flying

red sky
rewinding
our conversation

lived too fast
died too soon
a punk rock epitaph

apple brandy
a stack of
unfinished books

who will take me to the shop
when my warranty expires?

resolutions
an empty gym

no peace
two dogs
and a bone

table for one?
i thank her
for noticing

winter walk
the pain
before the numbness

why the rush?
restless river

caught
in its own web
winter spider

jackpot
the golden glow
of sunset

the reception we need
from the cellphone tower
we don’t want

prisoners
in day-glow orange
picking up
what we throw away

silent river
the secrets
it will never share

understanding
why the dog is afraid
of wind

the lasting memory
of a forgotten shore

silent river
the secrets
we never share

conservation trail
dog droppings
undisturbed

budget negotiations
the bartender
cuts me off

winter rain
tracing the letters
on a tombstone

beach fog
staring at
the end of the world

afternoon fog
a persistent
hangover

afternoon fog
the silence of crows
in a tall tree

gibbous moon
the angry words
i keep writing

windless morning
not a mention
of her illness

state of the union
a bigger bed

blue jay
always complaining
about something

the old oak won’t tell me
which way the wind
is blowing

too much coffee
when the bulrushes
are staring at me

approaching storm
but only the river
is rushing

winter night
the river flows
through the moon

fresh snow
108 spam messages
with the same subject

trampling the garden
a peacock
with golden feathers

stalking the finch feeder
a fat gray squirrel

fresh snow
a coyote
making tracks

more snow than forecast
the dow’s steep fall

cold front
that’s my dad’s age
she says

the state of the union
between my head
and my pillow

blue moon
when i needed to wish
on a star

eclipse
overlooking
the obvious

blood moon
not one
father’s day card

blood moon
we walk on opposite sides
of the street

news of her death
an empty space
in the morning sky

blue moon
picking
my battles

super moon
without even trying

biting into a taco
snowmelt fills
the arroyo

groundhog day
as if the dog expected
someone else

melting snow
hungry deer
fill the meadow

loyal to the bone
a hungry dog

how long i’ve waited
to sit by the fire
and play solitaire

overnight snow
i dream
of morning dew

waking from a dream
the sound
of breaking ice

gibbous moon
everything
i meant to say

the deep sigh
when rain changes
to snow

a deep sigh
the moment rain
changes to snow

writer’s block
a stack of railroad ties
covered with snow

rain changes to snow
gray squirrel
back on the job

groundhog day
searching for shadows
in the snow

last waltz
remembering
i can’t dance

how many secrets
beneath the surface
of the arroyo?

earnings report
a blast
of arctic air

how it glows
the fire
in her eyes

my retirement portfolio
a flickering candle

no coffee?
the apocalypse can go on
without me

probable cause
a sneaker
in the dog bed

groundhog day
our first beer
in weeks

cloudless winter sky
a tennis ball
in the laundry basket

snow squall
i lose my
train of thought

waning moon
my best years
behind me

super bowl
filled to overflowing
with cream cheese and chives

dive bar forecast
sloppy dancing conditions
with chance of a fight

super bowl sunday
a hungry coyote
in the snow

winter rain
a woman stuffs allspice
into her purse

approaching thunder
my favorite slippers
in the dog crate

super bowl sunday
a tree falls
in the woods

super bowl
giving the dog
an extra treat

isn’t it just like the river
to go on without me?

listening to the radio
i recognize
nothing

monday morning quarterback
waiting patiently
for baseball season

a perfect day
and then
the alarm

birdsong
wondering if it’s work
or a permanent vacation

her gaze of contentment
beyond the camera
beyond me

night after night
of dreamless sleep
an empty beach

always in a rush
and then i hear
the wind

bad news
i’m going to need
a black suit

mid-winter chill
the bears come out
on wall street

wild turkeys
not exactly sure
where they are

mowing the lawn
the garden gnome’s
cynical stare

a volatile day
i ask the mixologist
to surprise me

everyone’s valentine
the therapy dog

backyard politics
a fat gray squirrel
at the finch feeder

snowy morning
digging through the closet
for matching gloves

rural flea market
mona lisa’s
paint-by-numbers smile

snow changes to rain
wondering where
it all went wrong

filling the coffee house
with loneliness
the folk singer

unplowed snow
the conversations
we avoid

mixed precipitation
the old cat
catches a mouse

a day of meetings
the mud puddle
freezes over

was it only a dream?
a dozen roses
washed ashore

unused miles
i thought i had
more time

freezing rain
an unfinished poem

freezing rain
my unfinished
autobiography

craving a burrito
the old dog
wrapped in a quilt

mid-winter daze
the sparkle
of untreated streets

the morning after
rush hour traffic
also frozen

calm seas
a wave
of migrating geese

shucking an oyster
the sun-drenched beach
of my dreams

deep winter
dreams of sleeping
on an oyster bed

record warmth
i hear myself say
she’s the one

an unfiltered ale
learning how
to laugh

beating the heat
the bartender asks
on the rocks?

slow dance
the lust
for more

starless night
the wind cries
winter

watching the news
my granddaughter asks
what a yo-yo is

black friday
a murder
of crows

fade to black
a chill in every corner
of the room

final approach
the taxi driver
finishes his beer

crescent moon
the dog’s eyes
clenched shut

fighting the cold
i put on
a hawaiian shirt

partly sunny
a two-percent
pay raise

green wind
where is your
bitter girl?

the engineer’s tombstone
an erasable whiteboard

winter rain
when you’re the oldest person
in the room

fog advisory
time to open
another book

fog advisory
an unfinished dream

wide awake
the winter rain
on frozen ground

the search for distant galaxies
at the bottom
of my pint glass

imperial stout
suddenly
it’s midnight

floating carefree
in a mud puddle
a losing powerball ticket

still dreaming
of that gateway
to the ocean

another year
another name misspelled
on a birthday cake

that blouse
a button waiting
to pop

the sloppy drunk
ordering his whiskey
neat

too early
to go to bed
the dog yawns

end of the weekend
a burnt-out light bulb
i didn’t replace

watching over the stickball game
grandma’s backward baseball cap

the dog’s breath
waking up
from a whiskey dream

just looking for a hug
a teddy bear wearing
mardi gras beads

ankle deep in mud
the subject changes
to politics

waning crescent moon
when there’s nothing left
to write

waning crescent moon
the taxi driver
asks for directions

always
in a rush
winter wind

never in a rush
to leave
winter rain

faster than you can say
eight-seventeen
the greasy spoon’s wifi

the day the suburban socialite
let the chickens out

picking through cans
the weed dealer’s
rusty bicycle

a lonely seagull
the day the ferry
stopped running

town hall meeting
the pig’s favorite shade
of lipstick

somewhere
in this cubicle maze
a dozen roses

low clouds
the fire escape
of my dreams

ash wednesday
pressing the remote
for the gas fireplace

lakeside carnival
the taste of
saltwater taffy

valentine’s day
a clandestine meeting
with the accountant

fever dream
something moving
in the sidewalk steam

darkness
the price
of silence

valentine’s day
another game
of solitaire

on capitol hill
a watered-down cocktail
of thoughts and prayers

moonless night
the price
of doing nothing

valentine’s day
the empty carousel
of my dreams

shooting star
an unanswered
text message

twilight
sometimes
your lips

paradise lost
an island surrounded
by promises

low in calories
the popcorn ceiling

presumed innocent
daffodils
in the breeze

new rose
an extra bounce
in her step

frozen river
a question about
my cash flow

rites of spring
the 29 year-old
prospect

spring training
the former ace
and his clipboard

winter overcast
remembering the day
i stopped counting clouds

mother’s park
an empty
bird nest

new moon
when there are no more
candlelight vigils

winter fog
when all of the townies
are welcome at the bar

prairie winter
clouds approach
the broken fence

the fisherman
who doesn’t want
to talk about it

always making
a grand entrance
chickadee

winter fog
an unfiltered ipa

year of the dog
when we’re the ones
in the way

a break in the clouds
always wanting to be
somewhere else

open house
the rushed paint strokes
of the guest room

back bay station
a choice of empty
subway cars

sunset
pretending it will be
alright

a break in the clouds
her pretty smile
is not for me

morning prayers
rose petals
on cracked pavement

moonless night
when there’s nothing left
to write

between barstools
the dog who just wants
to be alone

mixed precipitation
the dog’s
rumbling stomach

reveling
in the sunshine
before the storm

etched in dust
on the trunk of my car
wash me

blood sky
i let it flow
through me

the only one
without a pickup truck
at the transfer station

winter sunshine
my untied shoelaces

river view
i go
with the flow

bartender’s special
tell only
your closest friends

winter wind
a swan calling out
to the night

desert dream
driving around forever
on an empty tank of gas

sad clown
trapped
in a black velvet painting

burying
a wall street journal
falling snow

ghost ranch
all of the pretty horses
in the dark

asked about the kimono
he replies
don’t ask

the stories
it could tell
a fisherman’s limp

after the gold rush
an abandoned strip mall

not passing the bar
a law student
who would rather drink

marathon monday a sprint for
the last parking spot

presidents’ day
an eggshell
in my omelette

in an unlabeled jar
aunt isabel’s
memphis rub

tree sparrows
in unison

presidents’ day
deep discounts
on democracy

blockbuster trade
my bedroom slipper
for a treat

mass pike traffic
my early morning
lullaby

school vacation week
a pair of fawns
in the crosswalk

sleeping in the mud
a construction crane

the ruins
of a town
called triumph

surrounded by
a barbed wire fence
the radio tower

record warmth
when she’s wearing
my bathrobe

record warmth
she asks me to feel
her forehead

animated conversation
a deaf couple
exchanging gifs

my adolescent alter ego
filling up
on appetizers

pouring the wine
she asks if i think
she’s evil

not in a playful mood
the upcoming
temperature swing

sweeter than ice cream
her scoop neck blouse

looking for a scoop
local reporters
at the ice cream truck

meteor shower
watching the dark corners
of the sky

ocean breeze
i share it
only with ghosts

backstage nerves
an old guitar
in and out of tune

first frost
my brother calls to discuss
estate planning

a dreary day
when nobody wins
the powerball jackpot

black star
a view of heaven
through button eyes

snow on the way
a technician inspects
the defibrillator

dream job
the one i dream
of leaving

in a dark place
the car speeds away
into silence

deep winter
when the sun sets
before the snow stops

power outage
my granddaughters bake
mud pies

clinging
to the dead oak tree
fresh snow

winter rain
as if we didn’t
see it coming

hope springs eternal
even our team is undefeated
on day one

spring training
all of the names
i don’t recognize

covering up
the anti-war graffiti
bittersweet

far from home
the seagull
and me

a houseful of guests
showering without
hot water

the recovering alcoholic’s
whiskey-soaked voice

what is he trying
to tell me?
red-tailed hawk

dark harbor
the fishing boat’s
empty nets

dreaming she could fly
a little girl
with butterfly wings

winter sunset
an empty
baby carriage

dusk
an empty sky

all dressed up
along the

puppy bowl
the cattle dog herds me
toward the yard

masked ball
a raccoon
finds the dumpster

after the storm
a tennis ball
surrounded by mud

out of tune
the teetotaler’s song
about whiskey

heavy sigh
buddha’s
renku link

ancient cemetery
dead flowers
every morning

summer mist
a recipe for
homemade soup

monday hangover
learning how
to die

morning fog
the day i forgot
how to breathe

equinox
a freshly painted
double yellow line

last days of winter
only weathermen flirt
with freezing temps

all-day planning
nailing jello
to a wall

heavy sigh
i step
on the scale

cloudless sky
the glare
from an open window

worm moon
too late
for the early bird special

monday
the horizon
disappears

false spring
a cloud
of gnats

exiting the subway
the glitter
of costume jewelry

shortest month
to have hardly started

signs of spring
blossoming
potholes

a new pothole
our tax accountant
wants to meet

indecision
a flattened squirrel

wind advisory
politics
as usual

who owns the night?
crow moon

shortest month
an unfinished poem

childhood photographs
more fragile
than i remembered

out of time
my old wristwatch

shortest month
an unbalanced checkbook

one in every crowd
admiring
the empty canvas

march nor’easter
when a place
is a storm

march nor’easter
when a time and a place
is a storm

power failure
and no one close enough
to throw the switch

gale-force winds
and yet the tall trees
just sway

broken carousel
you never told me
why you lied

driftwood
explaining that i wasn’t
always this way

in the howling wind
an old man
singing sea shanties

stormy skies
i draw
a blank

storm brewing
i order a
hazy ipa

shelter from the storm
a dog sleeping
between barstools

march nor’easter
the flickering
headlines

power outage
the rage
of night

lights out
could these be
my last words?

waking from a nightmare
all the clocks
flash midnight

after the rain
the hum
of silence

victoria’s secret
two teenage girls
whispering

after the storm
our neighbor’s generator
fueling envy

winter wind
the sound a tree makes
when it doesn’t fall

empty shopping mall
even more so
when i’m in it

dining solo
the tv signal
takes a break

worm moon
the trouble
between brothers

the wind subsides
and yet you haunt
my dreams

in a package
of underwear
a brief survey

silence
i almost miss
the wind

after the storm
a brittle branch leaning
against a crooked tombstone

intermittent drizzle
a soap opera
marathon

after the storm
a gate left open
by ghosts

oscar night
the dog
acts up

morning snow
too much sugar
in my coffee

after the wind
a ragged winter sky

the hawk’s cry
a night
without wind

in the forecast
a persistent backache

dotting the hillside
piles of rubble
covered
by blue tarps

hope
the spindly legs
of a colt

fair-weather clouds
a winter morning
without irony

over a quiet coffee
another ballad
of whiskey and trains

snow in the forecast
i stop
to smell the roses

all-day planning
the paint on the wall
still wet

false spring
she mistakes me
for someone else

false spring
she thought i was
someone else

tomorrow’s forecast
a blizzard
of uncertainty

tomorrow’s forecast
backyard buddha
unconcerned

somewhere
beyond the weather radar
a quiet desert

storm update
camping protesters
share a laugh

winter fog
chasing windmills
slowly

recurring nightmare
the suicide letter
he never wrote

her face
when i say
it’s homemade

security checkpoint
leaving my security
behind

tonight’s forecast
a messy cocktail
with lots of ice

desert wind
remembering that whiskey
doesn’t quench the thirst

winter storm
a squirrel
in the birdhouse

mixed precipitation
not knowing
what to believe

rain turns to snow
the dog shifts
from my lap
to yours

restless night
the stillborn sister
i never knew

wet snow
those who don’t believe
in penance

leaning against
the power lines
snow-covered limbs

sore limbs
leaning against
the power lines

hiding in plain sight
an orphaned fawn
in the snow

snowy and serene
our suburban backyard

wet snow
even the tallest trees
bow

lights out
the sharp corners
of darkness

longer days
an extra shot
of espresso

the suburban chill
of a starbucks
without power

daylight savings
awakening
to darkness

overcast night
when i stand up too quickly
i see stars

snow squall
winter’s last stand

tropical dreams
the palm trees
on my shirt

still water
the fishing boat doesn’t know
what it’s missing

play ball!
and here i thought
i didn’t like
cracker jack

a racial epithet
something about
sticks and stones

saturday morning
i become the man
sorting cans

howling in the moonless night
drunken sailors
on shore leave

quarter moon
the weed dealer
lost in thought

we have live music
said the dead man
at the bar

waning moon
she asks if i’d like
more wine

waning moon
how content she seems
in his arms

waning moon
an undiscovered
paradise

daylight savings
wondering where the hour went
a toilet flushes

in the homeless shelter
a mother sings
golden slumber

suspension of belief
more snow
on the horizon

late winter snow
a chipmunk
in the birdhouse

beyond the jetty
a congregation
of gulls

winter sunset
who needs a reason
to sigh?

winter advisory
the pines whisper
among themselves

saving daylight
in a little gray box
so no one can see it

caught in the brambles
the little lies
we tell ourselves

wondering
if the birds are watching
this weather forecast

the beggar’s smile
when i tell him
i have no cash

somewhere
above the storm clouds
crescent moon

spring in the air
when we’re having
the same dream

equinox
each of us surprised
the other is alive

false spring
another broken branch
on the dogwood tree

blanketing
the bittersweet
fresh snow

winter whiteout
a photoshopped
profile picture

blizzard warning
the snowman wants
to come inside

sleepless night
the slam
of a snowplow

whiteout
when there’s nothing
left to say

inner-city playground
how brightly
the broken glass shines

unprompted
a black hole
explodes

the baker’s smile
an irrational number

in my spam folder
email from
a deceased friend

snow squall
a startled chicken
escapes its coup

wondering if
they’ll change their minds
migrating geese

restless night
a mouse trapped
in the compactor

my favorite perfume
the sea breeze
in her hair

our view
a mountain
of debt

ides of march
i order
a caesar salad

working remotely
an old dog
lying in the sun

stalking holiday traffic
a red-tailed hawk

crows
everyone in on the joke
except me

my recurring nightmare
where all the clocks
flash midnight

after the storm
the dangling wire
of my nerves

signs of spring
squatters
breaking camp

outside the package store
the glare of a silver flask
on the dashboard

clearing brush
who’s left standing
and who isn’t

before i can get
the words out of my mouth
a popup ad

cloudless sky
the outstretched wings
of a hawk

st. patrick’s day
a four-leaf clover
beneath the snow

a drafty window
the lies we prefer
to believe

find me
where the river
meets the sea

march madness
when the weather is described
as historic

a sipping whiskey
the bartender’s
parsimonious pour

non sequitur
he says he’s not ready
to die

sunday hangover
a distant airplane
getting closer

cloudless sky
i empty
my spam folder

winter sunrise
a dog’s place
is on my pillow

my crowning achievement
an imperial stout mustache

st. patrick’s day
what the gypsy woman
told my mother

new moon
what the gypsy woman
told my mother

new moon
the silence
deepens

spring solstice
the interval between sighs
lengthens

walk, don’t run
the children cheer
when class is dismissed

luck of the irish
this puerto rican loses
at powerball

late evening
she asks
if i’ve had enough wine

small craft advisory
a little boy’s
paper boat

in their sunday best
a young couple
and their screaming baby

slippery slope
clearing the ice
from the wheelchair ramp

lonely road
our paths
diverge

march madness
the winds shift
to baseball

end of the weekend
turning my head
until the darkness goes

forgotten hillside
another village
of blue tarps

blue monday
when one word is better
than another

spring in the air
if by spring
you mean snow flurries

spring in the air
she tries on
a miniskirt

clearing my head
a walk
through the windowless corridor

rusty pickup truck
not abandoned
just relaxing
in the sun

tropical daydream
the soft sunlight
caressing her shoulder

one last breath
the day
it stopped snowing

opening the window
i let the river
inside

equinox
my shoelaces
are uneven

equinox
a 50% chance
of bad weather

rites of spring
the 29 year-old prospect
packs his bags

touching a nerve
the dentist’s
ethnic slur

winter wind
the plans
we make

racing the traffic
i lose

spring snow
no longer pretty

morning thunder
the snow plow’s
first pass

storm clouds
seagulls clear
the beach

cruel wind
the mangled limbs
of a dogwood tree

snow in the forecast
worrying about a friend
i hardly know

hometown crowd
the shallow end
of the gene pool

snow mixed with rain
i didn’t choose to be
what i am

the curse of spring
buds on a dying branch

dreaming they could fly away
the birds in my attic

melting snow
the deer slowly
blending in

lingering clouds
a stock market
sell-off

after the storm
surveying the damage
in my mirror

our new neighbors
a front yard filled
with tree stumps

dc gridlock
so many spiders
and their webs

reality tv
when you can’t change
the channel

when oblivion
is one nor’easter
away

rippling
through the marsh grass
summer breeze

groans in the audience
beware of
falling punchlines

spring sunshine
humming
a new tune

overcast
the shadows
grow silent

a spate of robberies
mother robin returns
to an empty nest

wiping his mouth with a sleeve
the top of the food chain

in search of
a sausage recipe
stale links

launching the seagulls
a dog
on the beach

warming trend
the right to
bare arms

mixed precipitation
i cast my vote
for undecided

palm sunday
discovering i have
no life line

older than i thought
the song
in my head

fallen sky
how high
the moon

when i wake up to
less snow on the ground
than yesterday

that moment
you realize
you are
an outsider

the peace abbey
sold for a discount
to pay off debts

missing
all the words
between the lines

our flashy new neighbor
a scarlet tanager

broken clouds
if the world could be
a sleeping puppy

i knew she’d be back
the tireless song
of the starling

stealing home
the dog settles in
between us

valentine’s day
forget-me-nots
for what’s-her-name

semana santa
a procession
of porta-potties

holy week
a supermarket display
of marshmallow peeps

end of the road
when the hourglass
runs out of sand

last train
the busker switches
to a minor key

clutching their lattes
not one busy commuter
with spare change

windless night
she asks
if she’s my muse

in an attic
swarming with flies
an empty birdcage

fair skies
my eyes find
a wisp of cloud

passover week
the ones not invited
to easter dinner

over cocktails
asking where
the scars came from

rip tide
the irresistible pull
of the swim-up bar

election day
ice scraper
or umbrella?

midnight
mystery lies
in the space
between us

on the wagon
a friend
unfriends me

ebb tide
a hidden message
in the sandpiper tracks

low-lying clouds
the ferry taken
out of service

doctor visit
biting into the core
of an apple

fresh paint
a start-up
shuts down

holy week
a run on hand-crafted
easter baskets

opening day
“next year”
is here

a growing concern
bittersweet
in the garden

snow on the ground
i research beach permits

indoor baseball
the bullpen
melts down

flat beer
our undefeated season
is over

light rain
and no dog
to walk

good friday
my cellphone battery
near death

low-hanging clouds
when that moment of inspiration
is gone

good friday
three gulls
against a pale horizon

morning chill
the pale blue eyes
of one who didn’t make it

waiting to board
grandpa’s secret smile

now boarding
everyone more special
than me

all ears
the dog spots
a rabbit

up in the air
the seat in front of me
leans back

clogged drain
explaining haiku
to a plumber

when the nearest exit
could be
behind me

opening the window
to a choir
of frogs

blue moon
sharing a beer
with my sons

easter sunday
i wake up
before the alarm

in their sunday best
a family sits down
to powdered eggs

an hour to board
i clean
my spotless glasses

after the rain
a dog bowl
holds the moon

easter morning
the security of taking off
my shoes

easter morning
the baby pushes
a stroller

easter morning
the stand-by passenger
takes a seat

tinder date
pondering
that second beer

helping them pack
the reason
i moved here

through the ozone haze
a mosaic
of farmland

april fools
an oversold flight

optical illusion
a planned community

approaching charlotte
she doesn’t even
notice me

helping them pack
the reasons
i moved here

always
on the inside
looking out

haiku poet
on the inside
looking out

april fools
our late flight
ahead of schedule

blue moon
a night
for sad songs

the lone drunk
and his past accomplishments
crowd the bar

light snow
a chipmunk
in the bird bath

who decides
when it’s no longer
a dusting?

today’s headline
the news is not the truth
and the truth is not the news

rabbit in the yard
the sun hiding
behind a cloud

wet snow
another wall street
meltdown

dancing at curbside
a cell phone
left on vibrate

after so many cloudy days
i curse the sun
in my eyes

home opener
the starting pitcher
throwing snowballs

empty strip mall
an open sign
winks

crossing the street
a faded flyer
reading lost cat

stuck behind a school bus
leftovers
meant for dinner

slaking the silence
the cork on a bottle
of cheap champagne

clothed in moonlight
she belongs
to the night

well into spring
the discontent
of our winter

tie ballgame
one last
sunflower seed

first dragonfly
i put away
my winter gloves

dense fog
the morning after
an extra-inning game

retweeting
a blue jay
and its mate

wind advisory
more than just
a poor choice of words

fuel for the fire
the myth
of clean coal

memphis twilight
the river declares
that it is rising

false spring
the one-time prospect’s
unconditional release

chasing in vain
for the words i lost
in the wind

lamenting the loss
of a comic book store
i never visited

in the news
the national guard is ordered
to fight windmills

opening day
the gossip
among starlings

extra innings
more spring snow
in the forecast

walk-off win
the dog
and my shoe

blue moon
a hug from the grandchildren
i rarely see

searching the thesaurus
not nearly enough synonyms
for idiot

stormy encore
the young oak
takes a bow

unrelenting wind
no one moves
to answer the door

weaving
through rush hour traffic
a flock of wild turkeys

first star
for the moment
i’m alone

spring snow
an unwelcome guest

gray or gray?
the answer isn’t
black and white

two weeks into spring
even the dog knows
it’s wrong

winter rust
a curve ball
that doesn’t curve

with sticky fingers
my granddaughter serves me
invisible tea

circling the drain
free coffee

my retirement plan
a late scratch
in the third race

masked invader
a raccoon
on the roof

optical illusion
at 30,000 feet
a planned community

april sunshine
talking with the taxman
about poetry

lingering clouds
realizing my friend
is a racist

april sunset
the time between renku links
lengthens

always winking at me
the one-eyed dog

april blossoms
her updated
relationship status

mudslide warning
pretend not to notice
that he dyed his hair

new love
an empty syringe

birdsong
i have to
stop reading

two deer
at the edge of the woods
not sure what they expected
to see

two deer in the woods
a need
to be still

two deer
disappearing
into stillness

the weariness
when you think
it might be snowing

border crossing
a pause in our discussion
of identity politics

gray sky
the words
i’ll never get back

his friday pilgrimage
the bartender asks
the usual?

morning fog
i forget
to blink

tired of the weather
i change the channel

floating along
the gentle river
my bucket list

filling my bucket
water
for the witch

guarding
the temple ruins
a stray dog

over exotic cocktails
expats argue politics

suburban sprawl
an unfinished
strip mall

stationary front
a continuum
of gray

when it started to rain
and everything
became possible

broken clouds
the loss of our
favorite shade tree

spring morning
a stone disappears
into fog

burning through the fog
the bitterness
of a double espresso

a taste of garlic
is it spring yet?

fair-weather clouds
the rich girl’s
torn jeans

still waiting
a stairway
to the sea

suburban garden
buddha ponders
the snow shovel

told to take
the road less-traveled
without a map

spring in the air
a blossoming
alibi

over too quickly
a dream that i was
driving too fast

rain delay
when the words
won’t come

no-hit ballgame
when the dog
won’t eat

awake all night
worried about insomnia

on his best behavior
a bull
in a china shop

seaside ballpark
a wave circles
the crowd

school musical
the choir fidgeting
in unison

last of the wine
the dog’s
furious dream

gesturing
with a celery stick
the corner grocer

for my coaster
a dog-eared copy
of

in the zen garden
my nihilism
means nothing

locked and loaded
the shuttered dive bar’s
underage clientele

knuckle curveball
a winter weather advisory
three weeks into spring

a family secret
her recipe
for miso soup

new england spring
wiping the snow
from my red sox cap

lost
in a train of thought
i miss my stop

writer’s block
my least favorite
construction material

mired in mud
the presidential
caravan

greedy termites
choking on
their own splinters

spring break
brittle branches
in an ice storm

marathon monday
the struggle
to remain relevant

marathon monday
waiting for the herring
to run

crowded supermarket
the automatic doors open
for the invisible man

marathon monday
the steady pace
of rain

patriots’ day
flagging down
a gypsy cab

hall of fame
in need
of fresh paint

spring snow
a facebook request
from an old crush

buried under
spring snow
a tired metaphor

tax day
my pen
runs dry

a sudden gust
my next word
blows away

a sudden gust
my last word
blows away

no moon tonight
an old dog
dreaming

penniless
the trains
roll on by

the mango tree
at the center
of the universe

taxes paid
the last train rolls
without you

a sudden gust
birthday wishes
blown away

the euphoria
of losing myself
in you

blown away
a bouquet
of dandelions

deluxe condominiums
where the church
used to be

my spirit guide
whispers
tequila

winter in april
my snow white hair

after the rain
diamonds
on bare branches

cold snap
when i need to hear
the river

at the funeral
no comfort
among the flowers

cape cod tumbleweed
turning over
a weekly rental

last of the wine
straining to hear
the silence

energy dip
an old dog sleeping
on my pillow

in no hurry
to cross the bridge
wild crocuses

morning walk
a celebrity’s tombstone
as cold as the rest

alone
an egret
at the shore

crescent moon
the weed dealer
abstains

alone at the bar
an empty bowl
of peanuts

reading the fine print
as well as everything
between the lines

sabbath day
a chorus
of leaf blowers

searching for buddha
a cardinal
on a bare branch

signs of spring
a stump grinder’s
business card

flash flood
the distance widens
between us

cloudless night
a pair of swans
circling the moon

earth day
two dogs playing
in the dirt

parsnips
because one should never
bleach a carrot

crescent moon
a devastating
changeup

a perennial favorite
hibiscus blossoms

high school reunion
one name tag less
than last year

with no clouds
to shout at
grandpa
takes a nap

birdwatching
someone tells me
i’m doing it wrong

late innings
seagulls
take their seats

late flight
canada geese
migrating north

spring cleanup
the slugger swings
at a ball in the dirt

spring at last
remembering the hot spots
on the grill

net worth
the gangster’s
gold tooth

vista maravillosa
no one has to tell me
what it means

blue monday
bare branches
filled with crows

asleep in a chair
another dream
of the great beyond

the non-golfer’s face
when the country club declares
foursomes welcome

sun on its wing tips
a seagull soaring
over the dump

alone
together
a pair of egrets

bridge traffic
escape
from paradise

their confused faces
a flock
of wild turkeys

signs of spring
a tick
latches on

honeymoon over
a new pothole
on wall street

when the streetlights go dark
we hear
what we want to hear

technical difficulties
a walk-off
home run

the silence
when no one is waiting
for the train

kendall square pub
astrophysicists
in their own little world

slow soaking rain
an unopened bottle
of whiskey

scattered blossoms
a fallen
cherry tree

classic radio
the dog asks
who’ll stop the rain?

asleep on the train
i wake up
in wonderland

overcast sky
learning how
to write again

peeling the bark
from a birch tree
i too
am getting old

the doctor’s prescription
some of
my own medicine

my new prescription
an open window
by the river

crocuses
they deserve
a prettier name

spring rain
the visiting team
tossing sunflower seeds

fenway park
the tarp
comes off

after the rain
knowing better than to ask
what’s next

evening meditation
the batter contemplates
strike three

finding my rhythm
the closer i get
to the ocean

a honey bee
when the flowers
have yet to bloom

cherry blossoms
the girl next door
with lipstick

spring cleaning
purging her photos
from my facebook page

break over
a plume of smoke
from a discarded cigarette

net worth
the fisherman’s
last catch

open window
the sound
of night

gibbous moon
i’ve written
this haiku before

under the moonlight
an old man
playing air guitar

too much spice
she says
it needs a little more

morning rain
all of my motivation
washed away

outside the cathedral
our tour guide tells us
to ignore the beggars

series finale
dark clouds
take the field

bogged down
in springtime mud
the internet

making a wish
dandelion seeds
in the air

grandpa reminisces
dandelion seeds
in the air

pink moon
a hug from the granddaughter
i hardly know

spring breeze
the puppy sniffs
dogwood blossoms

lush accommodations
an abandoned couch
in the woods

a hole in the ground
where the sapling
was planted

in my spam folder
a next-of-kin proposal

i try to clear the cobwebs
but they won’t move

spring cleaning
rumors of another
organizational change

spring rain
i’m the only one
at the bar

happy hour
the bartender
lets a regular
flirt with her

fallen dogwood petals
the puppy
barks at them

outdoor market
the farmer’s
rugged hands

may day
the company announces
its first-quarter earnings

melting in the sun
a monument
to what could have been

still riding the bus
a stray thread
from a prayer shawl

passing the compost heap
the words
we throw away

scattered dandelion seeds
the fear
of forgetting

spring at last
searching for buddha
at home depot

may day!
a reminder not to forget
mother’s day

the old pub
restored to
its original squalor

like pulling teeth
a dental appointment

last of the wine
i can’t wait
to dream again

the old cemetery
fresh flowers
every friday

carving his initials
the utility player’s
swiss army knife

inland breeze
the thunder
of gulls’ wings

writer’s block
all clear
at the herring run

the pastries
i don’t want
taste best

exhausted
the last page
in my dream journal

the lobsterman
letting his tea bag
steep

storm clouds
letting the wine
soak in

unable to move
the dog snoring
on my lap

out of blood pressure meds
the clock
keeps on ticking

after the rain
wild flowers
a little wilder

worthless
a broken
sand dollar

writer’s block
searching for a fresh
razor blade

almost blue
his love song
to the sky

overcast
the sky forgets
it’s friday

oblivious
azaleas
among weeds

broken clouds
what the swan
told me

lost in space
the one who has never seen
star wars

celebrating spring
a weeping cherry tree

writer’s block
a pile of brush
unmoved

passing the bee hive
new neighbors
across the street

lights out
dreading the beginning
of the season

trimming my fingernails
a sliver
of the moon

grandpa’s smile
when she calls him
an angel

last of the wine
i drink
the silence

reading a book
after too much wine
the words
swimming off
the page

heavy sigh
the darkness
deepens

zero balance
gaining back
the weight i lost

pet supplies
future home
of harbor church

weekend rain
finally the mockingbird
makes sense

hummingbird
celebrating
my misspent youth

hummingbird
my misspent youth

gone
before i can sigh
hummingbird

sunset
she tells me not to get
the wrong idea

cinco de mayo
a cactus
in heaven

scaring the birds
from their nests
construction noise

after the rain
an old man
curses the sun

one last cast
the fisherman catches
a sunset

free at last
a weaned puppy
looking for mom

morphine drip
all that’s left
is letting go

brooklyn fire escape
ablaze
in morning glories

newly divorced
he sports
a terrible goatee

at the border crossing
a doe-eyed girl
selling poppies

one week before mother’s day
bittersweet creeping
up the fence

morphine drip
the rhythm
of letting go

sunday afternoon
an old dog
waiting for rain

end of the weekend
a bicycle rests
against the fence

azalea blossoms
the cardinal
blending in

fog
leaving myself
behind

backstage pass
no one looks happy
to see me

broken clouds
the many possibilities
of birdsong

table for one?
i hear the words
echo

wide awake
the sound
of night

tidal pool
there’s nowhere else
to go

exchanging
my brush with fame
for a comb

morning fog
no one remembers
finishing the whiskey

trees in bloom
the hunt
for a closer parking space

talent magnet
an empty
office building

crossing the bridge
the wrong side
of wednesday

negative space
two dogs
straining at the leash

mid-spring morning
a cloud
of gnats

double espresso
focusing
a zoom lens

catching my breath
a waning
crescent moon

blue moon
my son does the dishes
unprompted

tangled clouds
always the last lawn
to be mowed

stubborn morning
i drive to work
without a jacket

phone call from the ex
a bloated tick

morning mist
i forget
to pack a lunch

60 years later
we’ve stopped finishing
each other’s sentences

cleansing breath
taking a break
from facebook

you have been selected
the telemarketer
mispronounces my name

rain delay
the tarp covering
my next word

late morning
my reflection in the window
of a disabled train

fresh snow
i comb
my white hair

trees in bloom
unable to see
the neighbor undressing

roses in bloom
the next-door neighbor
undressing

church bells
penetrating
the fog

commanding attention
a red-tailed hawk

in a slump
every pitch
is strike three

mother’s day
the fragrance of roses
i didn’t send

tender to the touch
a nasty scar

high noon
the shade
of a fire tree

mother’s day
i find the perfect
birthday card

war protesters
photo-bombing
a tourist’s selfie

mother’s day
the overcast sky
doesn’t care

morning commute
tired angels
finding their place

ascension day
a broken escalator

sliver moon
the last slice
of quiche

found
the perfect frame
for an unfinished painting

my old cotton bathrobe
too soft
to throw away

lonely night
what’s left
of the moon

morning traffic
the coffee truck
pulls in

filling the bird bath
a fresh layer
of tree pollen

deepening dusk
the dog twitches
in his sleep

fresh catch
the fisherman’s
new boyfriend

stuck behind a school bus
the scent of lilacs

dangerous intersection
a spider
on my elbow

heading down
the elevator says,
and i agree

crows
beneath a veil
of fog

town meeting
counting the votes
that don’t count

dandelion seeds
the fear
of forgetting

new moon
the fear
of fear

chest pains
the indifference
of an overcast sky

morning chill
i reach
for the hot sauce

the home stretch
crossing the bridge
into fog

a duel at twilight
cardinal
against the fog

quiet night
a private plane
hums above

asleep on the couch
remembering when
i was a mountain

day destroys the night
a car alarm
on the front lawn

the river
what passes
for silence

crowded flea market
hunting for a gem
amid the junk

morning mist
undiscovered
treasure

clearing skies
but nobody told
the wind

thoughts and prayers
and a discount
on coffins

spring in the air
one squirrel chases another
up a tree

waxing moon
ten more candles
in a crumbling church

thoughts and prayers
the stock market
also unchanged

morning mist
a mountain of trash
at the party house

too much wine
another
unfinished book

a book i can’t wait
to give to someone else
who won’t read it

approaching the bridge
a cascade
of brake lights

royal wedding
chasing a squirrel
up a tree

writer’s block
the last chicken
in the shop

holding my breath
i believe
in mermaids

morning mist
remembering how
to ride a bicycle

pop fly
the centerfielder
catches rain

too late
azalea petals
on the lawn

a daydream
two lovers
walking in the rain

dreamless sleep
a world
of picket fences

evening mist
stepping
into silence

deep-fried catfish
he’s in love
with a shadow

quiet morning
tip-toeing around
an ant

murder mystery
flying away
in the hawk’s talons

bridal shower
and the trash
left behind

end of the weekend
a motionless
windmill

end of the weekend
the trees full
of blackbirds

teenaged millionaire
in a glass house
getting stoned

crescent moon
the glass
half full

hanging on
my every word
crows

shucking another oyster
i daydream
of crashing waves

unimpressed
the cardinal
flies away

where does the time go?
one last quarter
in the jukebox

over pink drinks
the origin
of teetotaler

the oyster man
fishing
for compliments

gratitude
each gentle wave

sea ice
a new idea
for a cocktail

writer’s block
where the sky
should be

writer’s block
the skyless sky

honest twilight
a poet’s tears

abandoned strip mall
the tattoo removal shop
disappears

the grass is always greener
on our next-door neighbor’s lawn

meanwhile the mockingbird
wonders where i’ve been

waxing moon
a smile
on the old man’s face

free speech
costlier
by the minute

plain jane
with even just a hint
of eye shadow

second-hand smoke
a stranger assures me
he’s trying to quit

approaching thunder
fishers fighting
in the dark

before i can hear it
the smell of rain

swimming back and forth
a lonely swan

missing you
i overwater
the plants

clutching her martini
she says she wants
to mingle

day moon
so i don’t have to
drink alone

spring at last
searching for buddha
online

dive bar
the carpenter orders
a rusty nail

holiday weekend
out-of-state license plates
across the street

designated for assignment
the fan favorite

holiday sunset
hoping the buddha
is pleased with the view

grackles wondering
if we’re staring
at them

snooze button
the dog sighs

melting ice cream
did someone remember
the spoons?

over cocktails
church bells ring out
a familiar tune

downsizing
a tiny
inchworm

backyard buddha
closing his eyes
when i kill a spider

memorial day
wasn’t our neighbors’ house
a different color?

new moon
lights out
at the party house

unsurprised
that the river
knows my name

restless river
the struggle
to relax

heat lightning
the dog
sees the cat

summer clouds
my poetry submission
returned for postage

sunday morning
the weight
of saturday night

overcast
every which way
the marsh grass blows

storm clouds
surveillance cameras
in the butterfly sanctuary

polite buddha
turning his head
when i dress

memorial day
honoring the fallen
with our best prices

buddha won’t tell me
who threw that trash
into our river

memorial day
mourning the embers
of the weekend

holiday traffic
a banana slug
crosses the patio

memorial day
a parade
of pop-up trailers

memorial day
remembering when i knew how
to ride a bike

nightmare hill
footprints in only
one direction

suburban chill
a starbucks
without power

morning clouds
telling my guests
it’s the marine layer

something you said
moonlight
through the evening haze

flower moon
in search of
deadly nightshade

milk moon
caressing
every contour

those eyes
trying not to get
the wrong idea

my career
explaining what i do
for a living

not invited
but our neighbor’s barbecue
smells great

when did we start
rewriting history
in invisible ink?

morning darkness
my trusted friend
the snooze button

stranded at south station
the blues song
in my head

not here for long
fair-weather clouds

far from wall street
a cormorant
dives

in my spam folder
a commemorative coin
i’d rather forget

unable to sleep
another commercial
for tactical flashlights

vines of bittersweet
the conversation we keep having
about mom

strawberry moon
towering vines
of bittersweet

strawberry moon
i don’t mind missing
the train

black star
always the first
one i see

in the news
a feast
of bad apples

the silence
when everyone wants
the last donut

air quality alert
i turn off
the radio

a cloud of gnats
protesting
our slow internet

my online horoscope
page cannot be displayed

trying to quit
one bummed cigarette
at a time

deadliest catch
the fishermen’s
empty nets

scattered clouds
rebalancing
my portfolio

lover’s lane
i may have
gone too far

possible thunder
the dog
bares his teeth

summer haze
what is and isn’t
recyclable

morning haze
waiting to be told
it was only a dream

abandoned house
light pours in
through a broken window

pale sky
when i’ve run out
of words

wireless mouse
the cat
unimpressed

morning mist
anticipating
bad news

fertility test
the air filled
with pollen

pardon me
he says
to a broken mirror

happiness
just being
a dog

hidden in the ashes
a reason to believe

before they fade forever
peonies

rough seas
an empty life raft
washes ashore

the lie
and how
we lived it

lost
the former ace’s
command

fading fast
the words i wrote
in a dream

in the news
a shark tooth
washes ashore

morning commute
it’s never just
one deer

stealing home
a ten-dollar beer

doing the happy dance
my two left feet

a would-be superman
in search of
a phone booth

writer’s block
the hawk keeps taking
my breath away

columbus circle
just when i thought
i was lost

pay day
i kill
another mosquito

d-day
vultures encircle
a machine gun nest

pillow talk
a snoring dog

short layover
the flying squirrel
in our kitchen

lonely night
throwing a rock
at the moon

sad news
opening the windows
to let the chill out

at poolside
the innocence
when we dream

after the rain
bittersweet encircles
buddha

the sounds
we can’t see
in the dark

waning moon
catching
the last train

a quiet moment
watching the dew
evaporate

afternoon clouds
buddha’s eyes
remain closed

at poolside
the innocence
i left behind

too much wine
the words swim
off the page

crossing the street silently
the shadow
of an old oak

personal ad
she describes herself
as chesty

slow dance
the fragrance
of her neck

trending on twitter
a kitten
with a ball of yarn

questioning
the sommelier’s taste
in music

i question the ambition
to be a fly
on the wall

broken clouds
a chipmunk chased
by its shadow

on cloud nine
my granddaughter touches
my white hair

low-hanging clouds
a cancellation notice
in the mail

forgetting the day
i stopped trying
to remember

lights out
the deal i made
with darkness

smokers choking
on the scent
of lilacs

fire hazard
his 8-page resume

writer’s block
a knot
in my shoelace

writer’s block
a hole
in the fence

new moon
my email
bounces

new moon
losing the fight
against sleep

same time every thursday
recycling
my lottery ticket

flag day
a blind man
hails a cab

departure lounge
a recent graduate’s future
up in the air

morning smog
not enough coffee
in my coffee

in a dream
my grandfather helping
to set up chairs

at twilight
the kiss
she never gave me

farmers’ market
a basket case
in the fruit aisle

happy to see me
my mother complains
about my beard

gated community
all of the matching
blue tarps

table scraps
the service dog
helps himself

south florida gridlock
a golf cart stalls
in the crosswalk

the memory
of an exgirlfriend
among the cantaloupes

police stories
an asteroid circles
the earth

new moon
the receding tide
unnoticed

carnival days
my parents shrinking
before my eyes

dark skies
confessions
of a man-made lake

crescent moon
a gap
in the privacy fence

south florida gridlock
only enough room
for one walker

tea ceremony
confusing english breakfast
with earl gray

over powdered eggs
fact-checking
my father’s timeline

father’s day
my father forgets
we’re coming to visit

broken clouds
the roof over our heads
under construction

you have been selected
a recorded voice
mispronounces my name

father’s day
a rabbit
in the lilac bushes

always in season
forbidden fruit

back roads detour
and sandhill crane
and her chicks

thunderstorm warning
a devil behind
every detail

silencing
the turnpike din
a screech owl

unforgettable
that night
i barely remember

summer solstice
when all night
isn’t long enough

ominous skies
my bucket list
overflowing

watching
lest he cross the line
the crossing guard

just out of reach
stars
on the ceiling

a question of consent
sugar
in my coffee

writer’s block
the morning dew
evaporates

summer solstice
her long, long legs

summer storm
a sudden gust
and then it’s over

sheer delight
her see-through blouse

summer solstice
my unmatched socks

summer storm
crows answer
the thunder

border town
a mobilization
of seagulls

longest day
when the shadows
have no place to go

mercy denied
when the mosquito
stings me twice

where are the ants
who carried
my country away?

on the wagon
an old friend shakes my hand
a bit too long

my least favorite bird
the gas-powered
weed whacker

bad karma
the dog barks
at buddha

tonight’s forecast
an unrelenting descent
into darkness

first day of summer
my grandson’s
toothless smile

good wine, cheap wine
the gulls
launch into the wind

the faintest of whispers
where the rain
meets the river

in the darkness
someone else’s music

dark, dark universe
the campfire
of my dreams

lost weekend
raindrops clinging
to the wind chimes

in a dark place
a knock on the door
unanswered

complaining about the rain
the blue jay
and me

when the river is a train
running all night long

hauling away
my summer memories
a rented panel truck

mechanic shop
a crooked crucifix
on the wall

hitting the jackpot
her improbable smile

morning clouds
the dog loses track
of his shadow

putting on airs
the smell
of the ocean

distant thunder
the dog’s
unblinking eyes

dreaming beside me
what’s left
of the night

stormy skies
the dow falls

killing a fly
the nasdaq falls
over 2%

a break in the clouds
the river
winks at me

a secret society
what gets caught
in the shrimp net

writer’s block
a pale
cloudless sky

thrown for a loop
the ace’s curve ball

violence in suburbia
landscapers run over
a dog toy

the cruel flirt
another crush
thrown away

summer morning
when the sea breeze
is a sigh

gathering clouds
taking a walk
to clear my head

gathering clouds
the nurse tells me
i have nice veins

pay day
the flash
of the check-engine light

pay day
the wink
of the check-engine light

out of gas
a driver-less car
approaches the pump

in a sheer blouse
she sees
right through me

an unarmed man
surrounded
by hate

strawberry moon
missing
the last train

a two-car garage
filled
with memories

thunderbolt
she gives me coffee
instead of tea

thunderbolt
i weigh myself
on a noisy scale

strawberry moon
almost close enough
to taste it

smothering the silence
white sheets
of rain

strawberry moon
served with a side
of rain

after the thunder
an old dog’s
sleep

morning shower
always
a spider

summer fog
in no hurry
to move

wonderland
a silent argument
in sign language

lopsided score
the wall street journal
against a fly

never too old
to play
peek-a-boo

church bells
a steady hand
pouring the tequila

strawberry moon
an irish setter’s
sloppy kiss

that summer morning
when i forgot my dream
but knew that it was good

camera focused
getting my ducks
in a row

tall tale
my father still believes
he’s five-foot-ten

summer haze
forgetting
what day it is

cambridge cafe
astronomers
in their own little world

in the forecast
low-flying soccer balls
everywhere

bittersweet
parenting
my parents

independence day
removing
her bra

the old house cat
too hot
to chase a fly

summer haze
an unfiltered
ipa

party of twelve
the busboy’s
unblinking stare

interstellar overdrive
no one waiting
at the gates of dawn

desert memorial
no consolation
for the dead

harbor traffic
a pile-up
of horseshoe crabs

harbor lighthouse
like a candle
in the wind

cardinal song
because he’s more than just
another pretty face

under a tattered flag
a brand new
keep out sign

gibbous moon
everything i thought
i’d do today

see-saw
trying not to look
at my savings account

morning fog
when i realize
it doesn’t matter

summer dusk
the rusty chains
of a playground swing

osprey nest
the best seat
in the house

bottom of the ninth
fireflies
ascending

independence day
discussing care options
for my parents

independence day
setting up lawn chairs
in my parking spot

fireworks
an old dog
in the dark

independence day
a frustrated finch
at the hummingbird feeder

fourth of july
escaping america
in the backyard

full steam ahead
more metaphors
for the heat

drenched in sweat
the struggle to open
a pickle jar

carolina reaper
a new layer
of pain

hissing at
a dog on leash
the tyrant king

summer sun
the buzz
of dragonfly wings

lighthouse parking
for guests only

wildflowers
getting along just fine
without me

floating
in the windless night
fireflies

the cat’s tail
a question mark
for the dog

first star
careful
what i wish for

storm clouds
a funeral procession
of luxury cars

beachside souvenir
seagull droppings
on my windshield

lover’s spat
all is forgotten
when we hide the bone

empty glass
the sunlight
fills it

waning crescent moon
a car door slams
at the party house

fireworks
the dog’s
weary eyes

break in the weather
a 12 to 6
curve ball

walking down the street
as if he owns it
an eastern coyote

returning to port
a fishing charter
full of smiles

throwing shade
on the golf course
new england sunshine

redemption center
a mother, a daughter
and hundreds of cans

weekend sunset
a tall glass
of mulled wine

a toast
to another old friend
on the wagon

stuck at the airport
the homecoming queen

shattering the dusk
the boast
of a crow

hollywood romance
blue hydrangeas
in a row

writer’s block
a ferry stalls
in the harbor

low tide
watching the weekend
disappear

off-season
the silence
echoes

sizzling heat
a snake
in the herb garden

that recurring dream
where my friend pretends
not to know me

a birthday wish
may you live long enough
to run out of candles

the gift
of seeing her happy
with someone else

waning moon
the stray dog
who never came home

at the bird feeder
a noisy blue jay
and no one else

the obscure artist
unknown
to himself

gps tells me
i’m on the wrong side
of the tracks

does he know
something i don’t?
the crow caws

crossing her legs
i know
she means business

false dawn
her smile
for someone else

unable to sleep
the ceiling fan
goes round and round

rough surf
i turn off
the news

sliver moon
my eyes
won’t stay open

bitter moon
when the storm
isn’t close enough

new moon
the busker’s
empty tip jar

new moon
a dream
of blue hydrangeas

summer night
the river and i
going with the flow

waking from a dream
i remember
to breathe

under cloak of darkness
a crowd of protesters
awaiting sunrise

writer’s block
the river
running low

friday the 13th
i buy
a lottery ticket

new moon
friday the 13th
is my lucky day

the brazen begging
of one who wouldn’t give me
the time of day

sunrise
how early
is too soon?

floating in a dream
the kayak
i don’t use

bastille day
storming the liquor cabinet
for a french wine

peace on earth
a tired
cattle dog

fireworks
where the silence
should be

fits you like a glove
my father’s
powder blue leisure suit

gentlemen’s club
a throbbing
red light

obituaries
everyone avid
about something

day bed
where does
the time go?

time is money
my broken watch

seaside church
a convertible
with the top down

so happy to see you
i forget to water
the plants

end of the weekend
the cicadas don’t
believe it either

shining through the haze
a baseball diamond

monday morning
the lingering
summer haze

new construction
a bald-faced
hornets’ nest

power failure
we can always play
hangman

betrayal
takes
a nation

small craft advisory
try the micro-brews

clouds without rain
exactly
as forecasted

may your
dying wish
come true

turning off the news
the distant horn
of a train

storm clouds on the horizon
and then
there’s the weather

fuchsia hair
it’s a thing
she whispers

flash flood warning
and the sun
just winks

after the thunder
just the usual noise

after the storm
our normally scheduled
rush hour gridlock

after the rain
i remember to water
the cactus

restless night
the din
of overnight construction

dead of night
i pour
a stiff drink

in my dreams
the turnpike
is a river

flirting
she insists
she’s not flirting

restless night
wondering where everyone
has to go

morning stillness
slumbering sheep
in the pasture

whispering
around the fire pit
a log pops

moscow mule
remembering when
it was just a cocktail

dive bar blues
the harp player’s
second-hand hat

first star
it winks
back at me

cold espresso
the sun sets
a little sooner

talking politics
i crush a peanut
into dust

in search of fireflies
a low-flying plane

24-hour news
a dog barking
at the moon

a mariachi troupe sings
another brick in the wall

if i could just bottle it
the sound
of the river

all around the capitol
the jukebox plays
a kind of hush

sad clown
the one who didn’t
get elected

sleeping bats
another call
to the bullpen

words
my only
sword

resting comfortably
the activist

writer’s block
the river reduced
to a trickle

hiding warily
behind a cloud
buck moon

final approach
she smiles
at someone else

before the storm
a white egret
riding the breeze

dangerous cocktail
a missing bottle
of vodka

the silence
of marsh grass
waiting for the rain

a two-car garage
filled
with projects

waiting for the rain
i answer
the catbird’s call

sitting beside me
a precious pearl

pressed and starched
memories of my father
in uniform

stormy night
when i can’t
be calm

alone
i still sleep on
my side of the bed

restless morning
even the early bird
is sleeping

between broken clouds
a momentary glimpse
of peace

in no hurry
bulrushes

strawberry season
a red-headed
stepchild

sun shower
and no one asked me
to make a wish

fountain of sorrow
i haven’t got
a penny

cursing the rain
that washed you away

outside the animal shelter
a stray thunderstorm

when seeing
while blindfolded
is believing

when it rains
back-to-back
home runs

that time of night
when i feel
mostly cloudy

fear of survival
this dance
with madness

a rain shower so brief
i forgot her name

division by zero
always expecting
different answers

in the forecast
i wipe the sweat
from my brow

shark week
a broken zipper
on my jeans

darkness
where cobwebs
fear to tread

between rain showers
the songbird resumes
its song

my awkward phase
soon to enter
its 60th year

noises in the swamp
i turn off
the radio

marooned
the arroyos
start to run

unstable air
my mother’s
mood swings

intermittent showers
the company’s
earnings report

not a water ban
the mayor replied,
dryly

stormy skies
a turbulent
stock market

wind chimes
a low-flying
plane

buck moon
one week
from payday

writer’s block
i can hardly hear
the river

searching for a pulse
the river slows
to a trickle

buck moon
living from paycheck
to paycheck

in the dairy aisle
someone has moved
my cheese

blood moon
the conversation turns
to money

after the meeting
a miniskirt that tells me
she means business

lighting up the morning
the call
of a flicker

town landfill
the workers
talking trash

carnival chaos
the merry-go-round
out of control

loneliness
an isolated
thunderstorm

golden days
i’ve reached that age
when i talk about weather

stormy skies
the tyrant
threatens rain

summer haze
bittersweet surrounds
buddha

familiar shores
the ebb and flow
of history

i’m learning!
when she asks me
to lay down with her
i don’t correct her

the ultimate ruse
i pretend
to be myself

morning haze
wondering where
the weekend went

end of the weekend
back on the wrong side
of the bridge

balmy night
the sound of bittersweet
climbing the wall

unsung hero
photo-bombing
a tourist selfie

hazy sunshine
the view
from a conference room

hazy sunshine
on both sides
of the window

gibbous moon
both of us awake
far too late

surfacing just long enough
to catch a mosquito
the old catfish

alone at the bar
an old dog
dreaming

passing clouds
with a chance
of restless sleep

the street
named for a river
no longer there

struck in the head
by the apple
that falls from the tree

if the other shoe drops
and nobody hears it
did it make a noise?

beneath a weathered tombstone
grandma’s flan recipe

broken clouds
the sound
of a train

chasing the sparrows
an angry tweet

the storm passes
and there’s nothing left
to write about

high and tight
the whistle
of a four-seam fastball

taking the bait
someone believes
my fishing story

mercury retrograde
the fear
of beginning

restless night
a stray
thunderstorm

days of thunder
when it’s always
about to rain

lonely night
hugging my pillow
a little bit tighter

off-season
the fishing boat
casts a shadow

the face
of the last train
leaving the station

hazy sunshine
a conspiracy
of clouds

hanging curveball
we’ve run out
of beer

false spring
the rookie
packs his bags

the newlywed pitcher
flirting with
a no-hitter

now batting
the eyelashes
of the pitcher’s girlfriend

summer’s end
back to eating
in the dark

small craft advisory
the brewery runs out
of my favorite beer

decorating
the abandoned house
frayed yellow police tape

decorating
her bare shoulders
the fading twilight

when i need help
translating
her body language

summer haze
the things i tell myself
in dreams

those eyes
that ask me
what i’m waiting for

first light
she knows exactly
how i like my coffee

peace on earth
our neighbor
brings his dog in

after the rain
a blue jay sounds
the all-clear

after the rain
every shadow
back in place

blues jam
same cats
different hats

new neighbors
mending the fence
between us

after the rain
a woodpecker
back to work

fueling outrage
long lines
at the gas station

after the rain
a shower
of mosquitoes

fading fast
the words i swore
i’d remember

summer heat
the garden hose
slithers away

same time as yesterday
suburban cowboy
at the end of his rope

suburban cowboy
at the end
of his rope

stifling heat
when i fail
to speak up

summer haze
the neighbors’ bittersweet
climbs the fence

zen garden
i explain
what a haiku is not

at the fire pit
i rub two sticks together
to get a haiku

sunrise
the look in her eyes
when i call her honey

approaching thunder
a color-enhanced ultrasound
of our dog’s heart

named after a city founder
low-income row houses

named after
a noted townsman
low-income row houses

color-coordinated
the crow
and i

lingering rain
a friend
goes missing

restless night
a door
off its hinges

crickets
do they know i wrote
a haiku about them?

thundering down the highway
a joy ride
to oblivion

summer blues
in the key
of mist

new moon
the hunt for
a vegan restaurant

moonless night
this must be
where the trail ends

yes, mr. blue jay,
i do know
that it’s raining

leaving little
to the imagination
i’ll dream instead

new moon
the feeling
i’ve been here before

unshaven
i forget to trim
the hedges

windless night
a wavering
car alarm

lingering rain
learning that a friend
has passed away

lingering rain
news that a friend
has passed away

at bedside
the laces of our shoes
intertwined

his horse
unhitched
knew exactly
where to go

morning rain
a hawk calling
to itself

sticks and stones
what the red-tailed hawk
left behind

gateway center
one man’s trash
is a seagull’s treasure

between showers
a chipmunk
with full cheeks

morning fog
a shapeless
memory

summer haze
when it might as well
be raining

above the
welcome mat
no solicitors

a murder of crows
the empty
bird cage

heavy sigh
what doesn’t show up
on radar

satin sheets
no secrets
between us

promises
what was whispered
in the fog

cherry cola
not the scandal
we were expecting

summer rain
an empty
osprey nest

subtle
a jackhammer
from hell

after the rain
the tributes stop
pouring in

undocumented
another trip
around the sun

after the rain
the ominous silence
of a backyard jungle

another silent revolution
around the sun

spring cleaning
my photos purged
from her facebook page

free press
all of the elevator buttons
left behind

summer haze
remembering
the queen of soul

gone
the satisfaction
of hanging up
the phone

hugging her
oh so tight
a black satin bustier

mercury retrograde
a perfect
three-point turn

writer’s block
when the river
grows silent

quest for fire
when the gas grill
won’t light

leaning dangerously
to the right
the white picket fence

hummingbird
moment
by moment

gently down the river
my retirement dreams

who am i?
a temple
in the woods

summer evening
ascending the basement steps
into crickets

white swan
the ripples
in its wake

perched on an azalea
the moth that thinks
it’s a butterfly

summer haze
imagining a toad
on the toadstool

imminent storm
another shoe
prepares to drop

stalled at the bridge
a line
of thunderstorms

arguing about the weather
a tree filled with crows

starless night
i count
fireflies

a break in the weather
ripples
in the bulrushes

forget-me-nots
i don’t remember
what they look like

forget-me-nots
cherishing
my birthday card

starless night
one of the kids
moves back in

balancing my checkbook
if i had a dollar
for every sigh

long shadows
the dog barks
at buddha

back to school
a rabbit
in the tall grass

back to school
the stillness of a rabbit
in the tall grass

in the news
truth
isn’t truth

rainy day blues
the street buskers
go underground

all day
partly cloudy

partly cloudy
i always choose
the wrong part

wet paint
the sign
i should have read

sports bar
the rookie fumbles
his pick-up line

lonely night
so many songs
about rain

rondena
celebrating
my sadness

variable cloudiness
i divide
by zero

waxing gibbous
advocating
for a plant-based diet

broken clouds
one secret
too many

adulting
i hurry past
the adult book store

a snake unwilling
to shed its skin

sleepless night
the ghost train
of my dreams

waxing moon
when the music i love
is age-inappropriate

sleepless night
a truck left idling
in the parking lot

fork in the road
no wonder
i’m hungry

dotting every i
and looking both ways
before crossing the t

haiku or senryu?
i order
a black-and-tan

still ringing in my ears
our argument
about tinnitus

gibbous moon
a harried mother shouting
at alexa

last days of summer
the river’s
lazy trickle

far below the bridge
the ripples of a stone
before the splash

how long?
these footprints
in the desert

mostly cloudy
a new england ipa

teaching hospital
all the young med students
staring at my x-ray

late summer chill
tragic news
on my facebook feed

back to school
a flock of geese
overhead

a new spider web
searching for a veggie burger
that tastes like meat

waiting in line
hoping for immunity
from the flu

far from the city
the buzz of neon lights
replaced by locusts

crowded beach
the seagulls know
when the tide goes out

summer morning
the yin and yang
of sleeping puppies

morning sun
the crows have nothing
to complain about

sturgeon moon
a tug
on the power line

at the bottom of the heap
a zenith
black-and-white tv

move-in day
all of the other students
and their families

dog moon
out of the shadows
a neighbor’s cat

no i don’t mind her clinging
to that dress

on the road
we forgot to pack
our offense

red moon
wondering when i became
so angry

red moon
when the
music’s over

trick or treat
an angel
with a crooked halo

in shop class
the children build
electric chairs

summer heat returns
the strident protests
of a sparrow hawk

summer haze
losing track
of the beers

blackberries
my feelings
exactly

back to school
backpacks
wearing camouflage

suburban firehouse
ablaze
in morning glories

back to school
an amateur vandal
misspells graffiti

change in the weather
the poet’s
new persona

the end of summer
afternoon haze
with nowhere to go

getting old
the tired chimes
of a grandfather clock

tearing down the idols
we built
with our bare hands

recurring nightmare
i rush to board
the wrong train

balmy night
the weariness
of crickets

labor day weekend
the rush to escape
the rush

the door slams
not the kind of closure
i was hoping for

room at the inn
a mouse trap
at the reception desk

passing the old oak
i crave
the wind

labor day weekend
the hard work
of letting go

morning mist
i silence
my alarm

overdressed
for the cookout
a yellow jacket

crickets
what they’re telling me
about tomorrow

desert mirage
the giant scorpion
carries an umbrella

easy come easy go
what’s left
of summer

last weekend of summer
all of the weight
i said i’d lose

august in paris
the deserted metro station
of my dreams

september daydream
comparing
magic numbers

windless night
the silence
between us

late summer chill
the softness
of a dog’s ear

optimism
a turkey vulture
in the desert

chamomile tea
what she offered me
instead of a smile

rough road
a book i can’t stop
putting down

labor day weekend
all of the work
i don’t want to do

labor day
and now the wait
for clearance sales

writer’s block
not enough river
to make a sound

sexy selfie
to whom is she
blowing that kiss?

labor day weekend
the lumbering drone
of traffic

grandfather clock
i get grouchy
just thinking about it

hours early
for his big league debut
september rain

cloudless sky
what the birds
taught me

a day so beautiful
i have to lie down

laughing at one another
a baby
and buddha

migraine
it’s all
in my head

migraine
bludgeoned
by church bells

summer’s last stand
the kayak untouched
since spring

last day of summer
a seagull feather
at the shore

summer’s last stand
all eyes
on the hummingbird feeder

holiday clouds
i put on sunscreen
anyway

inspiration!
the sprinkler system
turns on

sunrise
caressing
the wind chimes

jealous
of how that red dress
caresses you

end of summer
the last slice
of pie

first day of school
a battle
of backpacks

bases loaded
the geese hissing
at one another

back to school
remembering how
to bite my tongue

bad coffee
tuesday is monday
all over again

also bloodshot
my third eye

twenty years
and the bloom has yet
to leave the rose

hot atlanta night
the journeyman outfielder’s
slow home run trot

feeling my age
the leaves turning
prematurely brown

now trending
anonymous

killing time
i water
the plants

researching my roots
i refuse
to dye my hair

a break in the weather
my grandson’s laugh

mostly cloudy
a phone call
from private number

mostly cloudy
one drop
at a time

with a side of irony
i order rocky road ice cream
from a street vendor

open for business
with matching
plastic chairs

shots fired
an acorn
hits the roof

early bird special
wild turkeys
on the front lawn

last train
my eyes riveted
to the third rail

overcast sky
pelicans
in formation

end of summer
a pair of empty
adirondack chairs

it’s the gin
that makes the tonic

that dream
when she asks me
what i’m dreaming

hot sauce
because it’s better
to feel your food

gale watch
wine in hand
i sway with the trees

that lonely night
when i started to believe
in ghosts

too quiet
to sleep
a ghost
walking
backwards

distant thunder
my dad asks me
how the kids are

geronimo!
something i shouted
before i knew
he was my father

losing my bookmark
i always return
to the right page

how many times
has my shadow shown me
the way home?

just like your mother!
that one strand of hair
that won’t turn white

in the forecast
seagulls ahead
of the storm

how many bookmarks
trapped in graphic novels
i will never finish?

overcast
a lonely stretch
of beach

late summer dusk
always sooner
than we expect

writer’s block
waiting for the silence
to speak to me

waiting for me
under the almond tree
a dream

tenor sax
hugging her
oh so close

subtle
the dumpster door
swings open

telling a drowning man
there’s a difference between
rip tide and rip current

open house
a door
that leads nowhere

rainy night
a feather falls
from the sky

late summer rain
and still i look for
the new moon

windows closed
i hear the crickets
in my tinnitus

weekday morning
surrendering
to the alarm

lingering clouds
remembering
where i was

september gridlock
another tropical storm
in the atlantic

stuck
behind a school bus
my next word

majestic from afar
and then
turkey vultures

cold snap
the slugger’s
late summer slump

waiting for
the last bus
skyscraper shadows

weekend
the rush
to chill

black orchid
she asks me
to stay

riding out the storm
a chorus
of sirens

late summer mist
the rookie stares
at strike three

after siesta
a stroll
in the afternoon steam

beauty
is in the eye
of the hurricane

in the forecast
a silent storm
between brothers

spinning just offshore
my next word

after the storm
the silence
between brothers

spring cleaning
a moldy cigar
from who knows when

landfall
everything that washes in
with the tide

late summer dusk
lost in a city
with no happy hour

happy hour
i count down
the minutes

late summer
the rookie pitcher’s
butterflies

etched in my face
the long lines
to nowhere

early fall
the rookie reliever unable
to throw a strike

last days of summer
the blue hydrangeas
take a bow

everyone
happy to see me
except the crows

hummingbird
interrupting
the dog’s dream

asleep in a hammock
while wild horses
pick mangoes

the new math
two children outnumber
two parents

etched in my face
the long
road home

when the palm reader
gives me
my money back

in the mirror
a face that has seen
the end of the world

batting practice
suddenly i remember
my dream

handing me the reins he says
the horse will know
if you’re afraid

tired river
a pair of empty
adirondack chairs

her indignant scowl
my third eye
is up here!

mexican firing squad
i toast
the revolution

another monday
an acorn stuffed
in the chipmunk’s cheek

rites of passage
dog and squirrel
play cat and mouse

that moment
i forgot
to breathe

end of summer
one last bottle
of wine

after the rain
a red-tailed hawk
gets back to work

waiting for the school bus
all new backpacks
except mine

no, you’re done
the drunk
corrects the bartender

morning thunder
waking up
with a migraine

tree frogs
the storm moves
offshore

day of atonement
a pig
in the white house

day of atonement
guilty
by association

in the news
a ghost riding a unicorn
to nirvana

gibbous moon
the dog sees it
half full

lark street
in search of
a nightingale

almost autumn
i eliminate
a medication

morning mist
he calls me by
someone else’s name

summer footnote
wild asters
in the backyard

snap judgement
a brittle twig
in the dark

fading slowly
fading fast
my summer sunset

growing heavier
each day
unopened champagne

morning gridlock
the crows answer
the car horns

home
where the road ends

moments after midnight
the unmistakable fragrance
of cheap perfume

stringing me along
all summer
her bikini

sweet as honey
but will she melt
in your mouth?

stuck behind a school bus
the incorrect usage
of its

one year later
an island surrounded
by denial

late summer chill
sad news
via text message

harvest moon
the dog digs up
an old bone

last day of summer
the rusty chain
on my bicycle

last day of summer
oktoberfest
in the air

first day of fall
carefully navigating
the staircase

autumn equinox
my unmatched socks

summer dusk
turning my whiskey
into gold

last day of summer
the birds know
which way to fly

empty subway station
the accordion music pauses
between trains

equinox
the game goes
to extra innings

falling leaves
another losing
lottery ticket

blaze of glory
a streaker tackled
on the football pitch

yoga class
all the laughing babies
touching their toes

changing of the guard
the snow shovel replaces
the broom

wading
through shallow water
and into my dream

autumn leaves
they no longer call me
prematurely gray

morning chill
the tired moan
of the furnace

sudden shower
buddha’s head
remains bowed

autumn chill
an unidentified object
in my coat pocket

reflected in her eyes
unquenchable fire

harvest moon
i’ve finally found
the perfect pearl

suburban gridlock
swerving to avoid
the dead squirrel

rush hour traffic
swerving to avoid
the dead squirrel

weekday hangover
paid professionals
mixing up their theres

harvest moon
a bumper crop
of rain

storm clouds
the anti-war protest
grows violent

piano improvisation
wandering
far away

early autumn
the sun still trying
to shine

rain-out
the sausage vendor’s
tired echo

approaching storm
the indifferent crickets

over continental breakfast
isolationist rhetoric

gibbous moon
one more day
to pay day

just a dream
the dumpster door
crashes shut

art installation
a frame
without a painting

on capitol hill
acorns fall
on all sides

all-night laundromat
a copy of awake
on a table

the accuser stands accused
the accuser stands alone

the whole truth
crickets

morning thunder
before my first sip of coffee
i’m angry again

in the headlines
a dog barking
at the rain

at the end of the day
a well-dressed man
redeeming cans

who do i believe?
oak leaves turn
from gold to brown

the importance of being
on the right side
of the bridge

cloudless sky
where will you
spend eternity?

extra innings
coveting my neighbor’s
cracker jacks

lily of the valley
the drone
of a leaf blower

uncorked
the senator’s
partisan rancor

morning overcast
overcast morning
an indifferent sun

prep school party
the things that pass
for knowledge

shorter days
sweeping summer
from the deck

waning moon
the last game
of the season

baja midnight
drunken shadows
on an empty street

an unpaved road
the story
of my life

she will make a beautiful mother
he says
choking on ashes

open mic
following up
an untuned guitar

open mic
an untuned
guitar

gibbous moon
all of the poems
i don’t write

early morning
the plop of an acorn
in the old pond

pigeon feathers
everything i have to lose
by being hacked

monday morning
talking heads
in unison

after the storm
my dreams
washed out to sea

breakfast al fresco
a seagull snatches
my bagel

that itch
where the stitches
used to be

fall meditation
interrupted by
a falling acorn

summer rain
wondering what the gecko
is laughing about

starting the car
the question
is that what you’re going to wear?

waning moon
a rustle
in the leaves

king of the acorns
a gray squirrel
among chipmunks

waning moon
watching my bank balance
shrink away

wondering when the spider
will finally get caught
in its own web

stepping into still water
an egret
and its reflection

light rain
the pitter-patter
of puppy feet

lingering rain
the charred remains
of my childhood home

reflecting pool
the old house in our neighborhood
is ours

shorter days
leaves and secrets
fall

yelp review
a puppy discovers
butterflies

gazing out
the school bus window
my adolescent past

autumn overcast
she thanks me for flowers
i didn’t send

the meaning of life
autumn wind whistling
in the pines

together at last
i win a game
of solitaire

reading my biography
a brittle twig
snaps

stiff autumn wind
chasing me
back to bed

fast-moving clouds
i startle
from sleep

trick or treat!
a map of sex offenders
in our neighborhood

mesmerizing
her legs

three million moments of silence
where the coconut palms
used to be

soft light
only the beginning
of harsh days

autumn sun
the slow descent
into politics

another stranger
telling me what kind
of bourbon i’d like

truth isn’t truth
her fluttering
eyelashes

columbus day weekend
discovering
the bar is closed

fall colors
when the bicycle brakes
fail

haunted hayride
when the acorns
go squash

columbus day weekend
the dog discovers
the chipmunk’s path

columbus day weekend
the dog discovers
the chipmunk highway

landfill politics
the separation of paper
and plastic

fall colors
the bicycle brakes
fail

soft breeze
the oak leaves whisper
among themselves

fantasy football
i turn off
the tv

ripe persimmons
i miss
last call

eking out an existence
the exterminator
empties his traps

first light
when i realize
i should have shaved

morning stillness
bittersweet ascending
the white picket fence

aren’t you cold?
she asks
wearing my sweater

caught speeding
a rusty jalopy
in the breakdown lane

angry coyote
at the end of the bar
dollars, not pesos!

hitting for the cycle
my bicycle helmet
full of leaves

october night
the pumpkins
have eyes

searching for my glasses
the deafening
crunch

bryant park
the chess player’s
checkered past

playing with matches
tonight’s tinder date

whoosh
following the arc
of a 3-point shot

indian summer
the fragrance
of chicken vindaloo

autumn sun
a deluge
on wall street

amber sky
i remember
to buy beer

falling leaves
she sits in
my favorite chair

rain so strong
i can’t see
the windmill

autumn wind
the fishermen
howl

nauseating
my twitter feed

closing time
my shadow shows me
the way home

over iced coffee
a fast-moving
summer storm

autumn wind
my 401k
up in the air

squelching the rebellion
a cloud
of bug spray

columbus day
i discover a mouse trap
unsprung

unmoved
by the storm
a buddha statue

after the storm
a ghost ship
surrounded by gulls

scattered leaves
the dog’s silence
when the wind howls

the dog’s silence
when the wind howls

chill as an adjective
my life’s goal
not to care

chill as an adjective
my life’s goal

ripples
from the apple
falling far from the tree

cattails
the cat wondering
who named them

storm clouds
the pace of my pacing
quickens

white lie
a dog’s toy
among the brambles

disappearing
into stillness
a white-tailed deer

at the soup kitchen
an old man mumbling
about microwaves

what if
the road less traveled
is a dead end?

clinging
to its leaves
the old oak

the old victorian
doesn’t want
your pity

no contest
her tight
wet t-shirt

playing solitaire
i solve
the world’s problems

climate change
heat from a
dumpster fire

in the produce aisle
where do i find
the thyme?

the screech owl
won’t reveal
his sources

breaking the silence
unexpected rainfall

writer’s block
the ghost ship
runs aground

off-season
the fishing nets
full of leaves

colorless
the autumn
of my life

after the storm
he calls me by
my proper name

midtown manhattan
the chop and sizzle
of a food truck

october chill
the snap of a fastball
in the catcher’s mitt

late october
a frozen rope
to the foul pole

telling my granddaughter
i also walk
in my sleep

out of left field
a carefully misplaced
memory

beyond the waves
of regret
the hungry sharks
of my dreams

buff!
the dog announces
that the heat is on

seventh inning stretch
i gather kindling
for the fire

a dog’s life
chasing the gulls
into the sea

inner city nightmare
a long way down

after the rain
a crow
drinks the moon

bay of skulls
a sickle-shaped moon

out of shape
what used to be
a down-filled pillow

first frost
the ball bounces
off his glove

killing frost
all market indexes
fall

autumn night
the soft purr
of a sleeping cat

frost warning
the brittleness
of my retirement fund

dotting every i
the lowercase poet

dot dash
always getting
mixed signals

writer’s block
the old oak
without its leaves

my old flannel shirt
comes to life
when she wears it

before dawn
the tuneless chirp
of a smoke alarm

recycling my lottery ticket
i tell her
i’ve already won the jackpot

early to rise
the murmur
of rain

double or nothing
cheap bourbon
on sale

my old flannel shirt
even softer
when she wears it

state fair
a seasonal worker’s
downward slide

a budding romance
her see-through blouse

whispering
among the neighbors
he seemed so nice

fallen leaves
wishing happy birthday
to my memory
of a friend

on the other side of town
an open door
to nowhere

haunted hayride
another drinking buddy
on the wagon

autumn wind
a crack in the old oak
deepens

falling leaves
how i’ll spend
that jackpot

too young to know
what too young is

rain chimes
the secrets
i tell myself

little devils
my grandkids
go trick-or-treating

dust storm
the politician’s
angry denial

first fire of the season
her soft
flannel nightgown

unable to sleep
the tired rumble
of a distant train

that face i make
when she tells me
i should dye my hair

monday night
an indifferent roadie

too old for this
the leaves that cling
to the tree

gibbous moon
a howl
of anticipation

autumn wind
the slugger whiffs
at strike three

hunter’s moon
in search of another
world series title

awake all night
my subconscious
anger

hail!
not the greeting
i expected

bachelor life
sharing breakfast
with snap, crackle and pop

hunter’s moon
the search for
license and registration

unhealthy diet
the atm
eats my debit card

hunter’s moon
the search
for an alibi

market correction
shopping for
new leadership

deep autumn
reaching for
the light

the road not taken
i zigged
instead of zagged

hunter’s moon
defining
the new normal

how high the moon?
and how soon
can i go there?

ghost town
even the shadows
are gone

autumn chill
the wail
of an ambulance

killing frost
i turn off
the news

halloween party
the graveyard between me
and my desk

halloween breakfast
the devil
burns my eggs

still gathering acorns
a fat squirrel

autumn rain
we may as well
make love

sleepwalking
right past the bowl
of halloween candy

snow day
the grunt of a teenager
lifting the shovel

dog whistles
and the old dogs
who don’t hear them

priced for quick sale
a late friend’s vision
of paradise

priced for quick sale
a late friend’s
paradise

bulrushes
with nowhere
to go

driving rain
as if it knew where
it was going

extra innings
my second wind
blows away

extra innings
when she has no interest
in baseball

autumn wind
my old bones
shivering in the dark

record shopping
the crackle
of an old 45

chilly morning
and no shortage
of cloud cover

sea glass
every place
i’ve ever been

mid-term elections
throwing a rock
at a hornet’s nest

thoughts and prayers
more spoiled milk
down the drain

morning rain
quietly
we make love

cold wind
every creak
in the floor

tornado warning
when the dog
needs exercise

interrupting
my next breath
waterspout

town meeting
loud cackles
from the overflow crowd

devil’s night
an army advances
against civilians

out of gas
the charm
of a ghost town

bourbon street halloween
a skeleton wearing
mardi gras beads

haunting
my halloween nightmares
the drone of a leaf blower

autumn sunset
the deserted beach
of my dreams

same time as last year
i wonder where
all of the leaves went

icarus ascending
another commuter drives
into the sun

when the music’s over
only starlight

trick or treat
the temperature dips
below zero

trick or treat?
a pretty girl
says hello

paving
our dirt road
fallen leaves

halloween morning
the devil
drives a school bus

identity theft
my badge falls
to the curb

trick or treat
the devil scowls
at his candy

day of the dead
every morning’s
headline

trick or treat
giving the devil
his due

devil’s night
the dog
kills a rabbit

candy corn
wondering where
to plant it

day of the dead
the bride wore
eternity

day of the dead
my adult son
asleep past noon

day of the dead
my mortgage payment
automatically deducted

warm november night
a letter
from my granddaughter

bursting at the seams
a bag
of tight-fitting clothes

november
halloween monsters
awaiting burial

beautifully bored
the cambridge barista
too smart for college

restless night
unable to put the leaves
back on the tree

autumn stillness
when my granddaughter tells me
she’s praying for me

between chapters
of a good book
a low-flying plane

blind date
when the first star
never shows

election day
a dead mouse
in the laundry room

turning back the clock
i hope my grandchildren
see old age

autumn nor’easter
the trophy returns
to boston

blustery wind
the fact checkers
take cover

high wind warning
my stomach tied
in knots

is she a yoga instructor
or is she just posing?

too much to drink
the unrelenting
autumn sun

overgrown
the path
to nowhere

turning back the clock
tomorrow is
one hour late

maybe she’ll
love me now
crabapple blossoms

rug shopping
the salesman’s
comb-over

low tide
the weekend
disappears

morning clouds
a disdainful sniff
of the dog food

busy intersection
the dog squats
to poop

watching his step
a heron
in the stream

stealing signs
the former ballplayer
running for office

november gridlock
campaign signs
at a busy intersection

election eve
still believing
it couldn’t get darker

election eve
an unfinished
bottle of wine

autumn rain
too tired
to sleep

winter thaw
a letter from my daughter
in africa

november dream
i take my place
in the river

election day
the wait
to count
stars

election day
pundits predict
tomorrow’s sunrise

waking from a dream
the white picket fence
still leans to the right

restless sleep
a kite
caught in a tree

never late
the morning after

waiting room
the magazine model’s
messy mustache

that look that says
the night is young

november
pumpkins
in the compost pile

autumn dusk
the oktoberfest tap
runs dry

over pink drinks
you knew me before
i became myself

may day!
post-election pundits
and their sound bites

bare trees
the darkness
deepens

new moon
where the shadows go
to hide

gallery gossip
what is
and isn’t art

waking from a nightmare
a knock on the door

beyond the bare trees
a cold autumn sky

devil winds
a wildfire leaps
across the freeway

northerly winds
the downward spiral
of the last leaf

overnight snow
too much cream
in my coffee

bare trees
why we can’t have
nice things

powerball
when baby needs
a thousand pairs of shoes

safe harbor
the dog’s head
on my pillow

veteran’s day
a draft dodger hiding
from the rain

veteran’s day
blue jays and cardinals
in uniform

the road to delusion
is paved
with losing lottery tickets

clouds
on a sunny day
my dirty glasses

bare trees
the jackpot
increases

bursting at the seams
a bag of clothing
that no longer fit

cold night
he doesn’t want to be thanked
for his service

where we said goodbye
a pay phone
in the desert

rain turns to snow
the rest
is silence

sick day
an abandoned
spider web

in my spam folder
a night
i will never forget

armistice day
tearing down
the cobwebs

in a fallow field
poppies
in the rain

snow mixed with rain
a for sale sign
in the front yard

wakefulness
the dog’s tail wagging
in twilight

bound in twine
the genuine
fake artifact

after the rain
a maple leaf spinning
in a puddle

not on
anyone’s menu
lame duck

snow in the forecast
a skip
in the record

cold front
she thought i was
someone else

smoldering embers
a perfunctory text
between brothers

storm clouds
my mother’s
unsteady gait

gale warning
oak trees and winos
sway in the wind

snow in the forecast
we gather by
the baseball hot stove

lost in
the lower east side
of my childhood

balancing my checkbook
the weight
i said i’d lose

icy roads
the sliding scale
of snow predictions

first snow
her soft
trembling skin

turning
his back on me
a crow

waiting for
her phone call
a faucet drips

first snow
reminding myself
to breathe

walking on water
a great blue heron

friday pilgrimage
the bartender
knows my name

finishing
the beaujolais
snow mixes with rain

bare trees
i draw
the curtains closed

what are you dreaming
when i’m dreaming
about you?

happy hour
at the sand bar
a great blue heron

after six games
of solitaire
i’m still alone

a monument
to patience
great blue heron

brittle leaves
he uses the word
estranged

hunger moon
a forbidden
diner

startled from sleep
the shotgun shack
of my dreams

off-season
the voluptuous lounge singer
hits a flat note

in a low-cut dress
the lounge singer’s
flat notes

eighties night
the octogenarians
misunderstood

meteor shower
and everything else
i’ve missed

heron’s flight
a boundless
cloudless sky

sleepy puppy
a little girl’s lullaby

the final verdict
a trial separation

to be young again
a dog chasing seagulls
on the beach

putting away the dishes
an illusion
of order

still shining
all the stars
i named for you

year of the dog
a soggy chew toy
on my pillow

restless river
the impossible stillness
of a heron

winter morning
the cat’s
sandpaper tongue

cape cod christmas
a starfish
atop the tree

autumn breeze
the one
who got away

autumn mantra
the drone
of leaf blowers

late november wind
oak leaves and blue chips
fall

wild orchid
i put away
childish things

shooting star
his long-range plans
one week later

shipwreck
a metaphor
washes ashore

dirty snow
a pile of
partisan politics

thanksgiving week
a little girl grows
an origami flower

bitter cold
another sell-off
on wall street

morning sun
a small dog
in a travel bag

waiting to board
high rollers
and their baggage

stopping for a shoeshine
in the brooklyn
of my dreams

airplane mode
a fussy baby

thanksgiving chill
an invitation
from the in-laws

jet lag
the time between coffee
and beer

now boarding
all of the passengers
more special than me

air turbulence
and we haven’t
left the gate

delayed departure
they called me
a late bloomer

friendly skies
the pilot wishes
he had better news

all night long
the slot machine
sunshine

waking from a dream
a golden pyramid
in the desert

thanksgiving morning
grandma cleans house
at blackjack

thankful
i’m not the turkey
i’m about to eat

thanksgiving buffet
i eat
my feelings

thanksgiving buffet
no cash required

double shift
the cocktail waitress serves
a whiskey sour

honeymoon suite
a memory
in black and white

oak moon
illuminating
the last leaf

beaver moon
indulging
my sweet tooth

black friday
what happens in vegas
24 7

black friday
i’m not
buying it

autumn chill
burning the letters
of an old flame

one day after thanksgiving
santa wears
a cocktail dress

oak moon
a lone wolf howling
through bare branches

when the first star
i see tonight
is you

final nightcap
a drunk couple’s
angry conversation

after turkey leftovers
hungry deer
fill the meadow

after turkey leftovers
the hollow eyes
of a hungry deer

vegas midnight
row after row
of flashing lights

beaver moon
hungry shadows
in the snow

the art
of the deal
with the devil

final score
a christmas carol
in the desert

waiting for the train
my next daydream

vegas midnight
the serenity of a
broken slot machine

magic trick
the weekend
disappears

desert night
an adult book store’s
guiding light

las vegas morning
huddling for a selfie
at the buffet line

somewhere
above the vegas haze
nevada moonlight

friendly skies
rows of slot machines
in the vegas airport

stalemate
soldiers
on a chess board

autumn fog
when i can hardly see
the point

autumn fog
the jet lag
touches down

my hometown
just a speck
on the map

cyber monday
a post-bachelor
track pad

winter rain
my aching bones

jackpot!
after my vegas vacation
i step on the scale

autumn fog
my muffled
echo

autumn fog
the echo
of police sirens

storm clouds
the rhetoric
gets darker

autumn afternoon
bare treetops
reaching for the sun

spring cleaning
before the last leaf
falls

autumn dusk
a tired procession
of brake lights

morning tea
the smell
of burning leaves

in their sunday best
a young couple
scolds their child

when you’ve reached your peak
before lifting your head
from the pillow

pot luck
who brought
the hash brownies?

enlightenment
finally seeing the forest
for the trees

a sigh of relief
when the judge mispronounces
my last name

undressing
for the moon
her silhouette

at least the stars
haven’t abandoned
the shipwrecked boat

first date
the blinking red light
reflected in her eyes

waning moon
the doctor asks me
if i’m happy

waning moon
she’s forgotten
my name

dark night
not even the voices
will talk to me

beneath the veil
a long night moon

silent snow
the secrets we keep
from each other

last day of november
the sun
glares back

quarter moon
and i can’t
spare a dime

clearing the cobwebs
from the dimly lit corner
where we almost kissed

driving over
the drawbridge
i feel the groove

rain clouds
adjusting
my expectations

finding
instead of losing
ten pounds

cleaning out the attic
gridlock
on memory lane

the exterminator
defenseless against
christmas humbug

reserved
for better sinners
a special place in hell

at the bottom of a drawer
two tickets
to a rained-out ballgame

beach erosion
she takes off
her bikini

crescent moon
the dog knows i didn’t
throw the ball

cold december night
when heartbreak
was just another word

the dark
gets a hold of me
magnolia blossoms

winter overcast
i guess it’s a night
for sad songs

remembering
the promises we made
at the fire pit

autumn mist
a strikeout
with the bases loaded

happy hour
the bartender asks
for my id

after the rain
a glittering trail
of mud puddles

when you’re climbing
through family trees
and you find out
your name means ore

autumn frost
an old dog
in need of surgery

cold snap
reminding my father
how old he is

he says he can’t
stay on the wagon
because he’d rather walk

downtown crossing
a drunk directing traffic
quoting shakespeare

fair-weather clouds
he says he’s surprised
i still work here

wall street construction
the roof
caves in

this is only a test
still wondering
when i can breathe again

venus
always waking up
earlier than me

crescent moon
she barely
noticed me

christmas shopping
who can i give
last year’s advent candle?

winter chill
can’t you wait
until winter?

cold war
unwanted
attention

freedom trail
the shortest distance
to happy hour

cold snap
hearing my musical tastes
described as archaic

cold snap
stepping on
a twig

aiming to please
an assassin
and his gun

unbowed by the snow
the slender oaks
and me

moonless night
another one
too young to die

new moon
emptying
another drawer

when the raging river
consumes
my rage

new moon
another letter
unanswered

what happened to us?
he asked
as if we had somehow
disappeared

hunting season
is it too late
for a flu shot?

pay day
the dew
freezes over

black ice
my granddaughter asks me
if i believe in god

autumn stillness
what buddha
believes

new moon
my granddaughter makes
my daughter’s face

cold night
when everyone wants
to believe

santa
i’d like to learn how to spell
poinsettia

moonless night
a goose
defends his nest

winter construction
a family
of woodpeckers

mystery solved
the dog chews
my missing sock

eyes that tell me
my eyes
are up here

turning his back
on our suburban home
backyard buddha

christmas music
glass on the pavement
under my shoe

christmas shopping
a little lost girl
with angel wings

mystery solved
the sock thief’s
wagging tail

hazy sunshine
a tree branch
floating down the river

hunting season over
the medical examiner’s
shiny white van

early december
a pumpkin
bobbing in the river

old photograph
the ghost
of weddings past

crowded airplane
my fart travels
business class

executive privilege
the right
to remain silent

eating a banana
i read
origin of the species

waning moon
when they know you’re not
a member

interstellar space
where all of the
unmatched socks go

unfulfilled
a gift certificate
from last christmas

reading my thoughts
she won’t look me
in the eye

bobbing for apples
the one i can’t let
get away

all downhill from here
venus
in the morning sky

dna match
i instinctively reach
for my wallet

twisted tree roots
my arthritis
acts up

writer’s block
the thermometer
doesn’t budge

out of change
i find
a working payphone

suddenly shy
venus hiding behind
morning clouds

lost in the woods
christmas
finds us

winter dusk
for a moment i forget
where i am

snarling weekend traffic
a christmas tree sale

from this year
to the next
a flowing river

snow moon
lighting the way
to who knows where

sunday brunch
an extraneous squiggle
on my paisley tie

dark continent
my granddaughter’s
long-distance pout

that look
when she’s naughty
and nice

dining alone
the extraneous
place setting

burn before reading
a christmas card
from an old flame

writer’s block
a private road
under construction

snow showers
a christmas card
returned for postage

the wall
we tore down
in our dreams

after maria
a family dines al fresco
every day

morning meditation
no escape
from christmas music

fair-weather clouds
still plenty of room
to fall

fair-weather clouds
nowhere to go
but up

fresh asphalt
the dow
closes lower

dark nights
and the children
they leave behind

overcast morning
i’m mistaken
for someone else

tapping my brakes
because there’s always
another deer

the same hazy sun
on either side
of the wall

seaside chapel
the stained glass sailboat
of my dreams

rough road
ten days
until christmas

autumn mist
another resolution
i’m saving
for next year

9 days to christmas
counting the ways to say no
to eggnog

raw night
more wasabi
for my sushi

between tantrums
increasingly poor decisions

remembering summer
a tall glass
of mulled wine

desert wind
whistling
at the moon

meanwhile
in a desert camp
not a chestnut
was roasting

executive order
a pile of
dirty snow

seven days before christmas
a cold wind blows

dog kisses
a birthday gift
that keeps on giving

dirty snow
afraid to look
at my 401k

it goes without saying
moon shadows
in the snow

christmas potluck
a casserole
of unknown origin

meanwhile
in a desert camp
not a chestnut roasting

done with christmas shopping
we open up
the cheap champagne

last-minute shopping
another mouse
caught in a trap

suburban tragedy
emo kids
with nothing
to cry about

dark autumn night
a skylark
with a broken muffler

elf on a shelf
an unmatched bookend

last days of autumn
contemplating
a beige sky

orion’s belt
i suck in
my gut

as i never
remembered her
a photo in the fog

mulled wine
trimming down
my christmas card list

walking in fog
let’s not
get lost

christmas party
a long line at the
virtual reality tent

sharp curve
wondering if my phone has
rollover minutes

solstice
my temper
grows shorter

last day of autumn
stock prices continue
to fall

when the palm reader knows
she should have stayed home

gibbous moon
the unblinking eyes
of a guide dog

after the party
we search for the missing button
on her blouse

new deal
i shuffle twice

mad dog
a compromised
position

lights out
we find
the missing button

sunrise
i belong
to no one

heron in flight
a silent serenade

solstice
a great heron
standing still

longest night
a dream
within a dream

dive bar
santa claus
on coffee break

winter solstice
her tan lines
fade

flood warning
more water than usual
under the bridge

this year’s stocking stuffer
a lump of clean coal

open mic night
another
whiskey sour

the clearing
between rain
and fog

not cuddly
after all
a bear market

new neighbors
a freshly painted
privacy fence

pub crawl
finding our way back
to oblivion

penguin dust
the constellations
in the sky

winter fetch
a tennis ball
in the laundry basket

solstice moon
it’s all downhill
from here

solstice moon
i remember

cold moon
all alone
in the morning sky

hanging up christmas lights
a tenuous grip
on the ladder

a clearing in the woods
i leave the perfect christmas tree
alone

osprey nest?
or just a messy
clump of leaves?

clear-eyed
i accept a pour
from an unlabeled bottle

cloudless sky
the haze
of a new england ipa

the night before christmas
your annual reminder
that mice can’t read

night before christmas
the lobster pots hung
by the wood shed with care

a dusting of snow
this year’s
christmas bonus

the christmas gift
i didn’t want
a nagging cough

peace on earth
an empty beach
on christmas eve

not a creature was stirring
some assembly required

christmas day
49 days until
spring training

christmas past
far less snow
in my beard

decorating the tree
my green-eyed
grandchildren

christmas night
mulling over the contents
of the mulled wine

boxing day
recycling
the christmas bows

boxing day
a former colleague’s
empty cubicle

santa rally
the warmth
of an ugly sweater

cutting the cord
i hope i remembered
my parachute

the bag lady screams
courtesy is contagious!

losing my voice
all i have left
are words

waning moon
how exuberantly we cheer
each lie

knowing my place
a woodchuck’s
unblinking eyes

birds in formation
following
no one

watching the news
a craving
for muddled wine

river road
rounding the corner
into a dream

black ice
erasing wall street’s
modest gains

four days after christmas
first come, first serve
at the give and take shed

it will make
a beautiful bonfire
the pile of christmas trees

today’s earworm
a song
i can’t quite place

tamal or tamale?
no need to argue
i’ll take two

i’ve won the prize
but the boiler room caller
can’t pronounce my name

warm winter day
ladybugs
in waiting

after the party
lingering smoke from
a citronella candle

just one drink
he promised
ordering a double

waning moon
sorting through photos
of a younger me

waiting on hold
the polar icecaps
melt

the cat’s face
when i confess
i’ve never read hemingway

new year’s eve party
i forget the name
of an old acquaintance

new year’s day
another resolution
around the sun

starstruck
a real
rocket scientist

fireworks
whether or not
you believe

new year’s eve
waiting for the other
shoe to drop

minutes before midnight
the ball drops
from the dog’s mouth

new year’s day brunch
a plateful
of broken resolutions

new year’s day
when it’s only
a head cold

winter wind
the long
journey home

high wind warning
i turn off
the news

bad whiskey
that morning i woke up
with the wrong head

dockside marina
the fisherman’s
salty language

this year’s resolution
to purchase only
winning lottery tickets

northerly wind
carrying away
the long weekend

fresh snow
always covering
her tracks

crescent moon
the girl next door
draws the shades

skipping breakfast
the crunch
of morning frost

in the beginning
a breakfast sandwich
made to order

january 2nd
resolutions running laps
around the office building

crescent moon
a stranger knows for certain
the lunar landing was a hoax

overnight snow
when i’ve dreamed
too much

writer’s block
where the purple road
won’t take me

cold wind
whispering
dementia

light snowfall
the stock market
plummets

beneath the shadows
a tantalizing
softness

high resolution
the new dispensary
in town

adult book store
not always sure
which end is up

mild winter day
our new neighbor
introduces himself

fear of snakes
the hiss
of a barn cat

may day
a withering
carnation

snow flurries
entering
the sacred temple

sleepwalking
i’m unafraid
of the dark

dancing on the roof
the fear
of joy

hazy sunset
i feel it getting
away from me

campaign posters
hanging slightly
left of center

daydreaming
i forget
that i am daydreaming

stopping only
to smell the roses
hummingbird

winter rain
the poetry
writes itself

new moon
everything
that can hurt you

pawned for quick cash
a diamond ring
with a slight imperfection

after the rain
bare branches
dancing in the wind

that hush
when you know you’re not in
the inner circle

cracks in the mirror
i don’t remember
growing older

epiphany
the birds
who never migrate

epiphany
when you have
to leave

three kings
fashionably late
to the party

three queens
not waiting for
the red carpet

windrush square
the swirl
of unraked leaves

new moon
the shadows
disappear

at the flea market
hand-knit baby mittens
priced for quick sale

cold snap
i reach for
the snooze button

cold snap
when the card reader
stops working

sliver moon
watching the pot
slowly boil

grinding to a halt
dark-roasted
coffee beans

overcast night
a black cat
purrs

approaching snow
she didn’t expect me
to be so gray

frigid night
the dog’s
reluctant steps

a gated community
not safe
from itself

arguing politics
like arguing
with a wall

abandoned ranch
the wild horses
of my dreams

winter fog
the fishing boats
i can only hear

lonely desert road
the billionaire sings
bye bye blackbird

gray morning
birdsong
in a minor key

cold front
she reminds me that her father
is younger than me

today’s forecast
a wind advisory
on capitol hill

winter fog
distant
fishing boats

googling a recipe
for seething anger

mexican sage
only the wisest chefs
cook with it

tea ceremony
english breakfast
before bedtime

harvard square station
ivy encircles
the third rail

the enduring image
my first grade photo
in black-and-white

snow flurries
an unanswered
text message

dark winter night
wondering why
i live here

fair-weather friend
knowing it can’t be
too cold to snow

whiskey dreams
the dog
licks my face

gesturing
with a dried apricot
you should eat more fruit

bad whiskey
an angel
at the wrong address

bitter cold
an unpublished poem

too cold for fog
another morning after

refuting newton
a thrown tantrum
never falls

dried apricots
lamenting
the designated hitter

epiphany
there’s no more room
in my inbox

scrutinizing my passport
somebody’s red-headed stepchild

recycling
the childhood memories
i tried to repress

opening soon
an overpriced chain store
in an ill-conceived
shopping center

continued cold
i lose another game
of solitaire

crescent moon
the can’t-miss prospect’s
failed drug test

wolf moon
i trim
my beard

writer’s block
an abandoned
cranberry bog

fair-weather clouds
another week
of sunsets

clinging to summer
the leaves
of an old oak tree

my investment portfolio
golden leaves
on the ground

my credit report
i owe someone
an apology

sunset at low tide
no romance
among seagulls

the meditation center
carved into a cluster
of luxury townhouses

a woman’s choice
as adjudicated
by men

under the weather
a snow-covered balcony

writer’s block
a stationary front
on radar

no longer
financially viable
the peace abbey

commander-in-chief
the jukebox plays
secret agent man

late night
dreams
of drifting snow

walking in the dark
a fear
of falling asleep

a kiss goodnight
the glowing embers
of a campfire

blue jays and crows
at the bird feeder
everyone’s a critic

today’s forecast
a warm place
in the sun

power failure
we dine on junk food
by candlelight

crossing the bridge
winter rain falls
into the mystic

rehab
after a pause
he points to his shoulder

in the forecast
a chance
of plum blossoms

such a nice guy
said every girl’s mother
about me

snow on the way
an expectant mother
rubs her belly

stylized violence
now available
in high-definition

approaching snow
watching my breath
freeze

storm clouds
the size
of my headache

in the waiting room
an empty tissue box
covered in dust

in the exam room
an empty container
of hand sanitizer

snow flurries
a wild
and precious life

midnight stroll
i remember why
i don’t take them

another dead soldier
paying off a debt
he didn’t owe

windless morning
an abandoned
osprey nest

explaining to the dog
that it’s too cold
for a walk

the exgirlfriend
who took too long
to unfriend me

snow showers
my 401k
takes a bath

over cold coffee
a heated conversation
about finances

bad coffee
the grounds
for impeachment

freezing drizzle
i adjust
the thermostat

icy roads
now featuring
interactive weather

blood moon
never forget

coming soon
marching for the right
to march

i can feel it from here
another pothole
on wall street

light snow
nobody notices
that i’ve lost weight

king for a day
the perfect pot
of coffee

snow changes to rain
my father says
we’re doing
the best we can

under the weather
the deluge
begins

adagio
a songbird
in the rain

explaining purple
to a blind man

in a dream
marilyn becomes
norma jeane again

realizing
you are the elephant
in the room

wolf moon
reflected in
the dog’s eyes

last call
i hug
the barstool

wolf moon
i cast
a five-o’clock shadow

when brush fires
no longer
spark joy

crescent moon
in search of
safe harbor

hope
a puppy
yawns

blood moon
text message
from a distant relative

wolf moon
the dog
steals my blanket

windless morning
a cat sits
next to buddha

one month after christmas
my wife and i
exchange coughs

the snow shovel
neither more nor less effective
when i swear at it

writer’s block
the dented blade
of a snow shovel

blood moon
i change up
my heart meds

in the news
tires spinning
on thin ice

waning moon
celebrating the numbers
on the odometer

mergers and acquisitions
she calls the waiter
for the check

mergers and acquisitions
she calls for
the check

my mother’s birthday
an unclaimed jackpot

winter rain
the absence
of birdsong

winter rain
everything that goes
without saying

winter rain
when is it time
to lie about my age?

balance alert
a yoga pose
i shouldn’t do

melting snow
everything
we leave behind

wintry mix
one day blends
into the next

over the bridge
suspension
of disbelief

meanwhile
on capitol hill
a mud puddle
freezes over

promises
a pile of
dirty snow

campaign promises
a pile of dirty snow
in every driveway

sudden thunder
stumbling upon
a nesting goose

freezing and thawing
do i even have
a lucky number?

late morning
when the coffee is too good
to savor

just outside
my bachelor pad
an abandoned bird nest

cold brew
arguing about
how much snow we’ll get

spring cleaning
choosing the memories
i will keep

her gofundme page
what i could have spent
on a bottle of wine

chef’s surprise
i order my dinner
in broken spanish

low tide
i build a wall
around my sand castle

winter moth
memorials
on her facebook page

past her due date
the tall oak
clinging to its leaves

not feeling its vibe
police helicopter

past its expiration date
the yogurt
i just finished

ghosts whispering
in the shadow
of the old tree

sober january
the drunken carousal
of ghosts

unable to sleep
i press the remote
for the fireplace

unable to sleep
another way
to look at the moon

unable to sleep
but we’ll be ready
for the next storm

crescent moon
unable to keep
my eyes open

fourth quarter earnings
wind-chill warnings
below zero

moments before the alarm
my deepest sleep

snow flurries
a modest recovery
on wall street

day of the dead
my adult son
awake before dawn

snow in the forecast
she stops dyeing
her hair

rush hour snow
every way
is the long way home

lightness of being
i clear out
my spam folder

snow squall
explaining it
to the dog

single-digit temperatures
i can’t feel
my fingers

unable to sleep
frost climbing
the storm windows

last day of the month
paper cuts
from an uncashed check

a dream
about an island
of forgotten dreams

identity theft
drifting snow
erases my footprints

frightened deer
the stillness
runs away

the future marine
doesn’t need
a diaper change

groundhog day
a stranger tells me
i haven’t changed

cold snap
an extra treat
in the dog bowl

meanwhile
an updated roster
for the puppy bowl

crescent moon
the candidate kisses
another baby

please keep your distance
another candidate
enters the field

whiteout
a closed-door
cabinet meeting

reading his apology
i’m deeply sorry too

continued cold
she says she’s
coming to bed

a familiar spirit
on the other side
of the wall

groundhog day
the wrong side of the bed
every morning

super bowl saturday
a goal line stand
at the deli counter

taking center stage
a red fox
in the motion-activated light

deep winter
believing the sun
will never rise

unable to hold a charge
will this be the day
the music dies?

super bowl
still intact
after dropping it

singles night
the jukebox plays
dancing with myself

daylily
i ask her
to stay

national emergency
now entering
its third year

groundhog day again?
this super bowl
looks familiar

new moon
the same old crap
in my spam folder

melting snow
i order a double whiskey
with no ice

mercury retrograde
the painting was upside down
all along

between a rock
and a hard place
an abandoned pickup truck

overcast sky
everything
that wasn’t said

winter warm-up
she loosens
that top button

harvest moon
rolling in the hay
with the farmer’s daughter

filling the room
all of the books
i haven’t read

make no mistake
the year of the dog
never ends

new moon
a u-haul van
across the street

new moon
she asks if i would
dye my hair

watching the weather
to escape the weather

year of the pig
i go back
for seconds

year of the pig
the state
of the union

pig’s feet
i decide
to call a cab

melting snow
brown and beige
turn to gold

words were exchanged
a veneer of ice
on the mud puddle

whispering
an abandoned
palm orchard

crossing the line
a town
with no happy hour

sleepwalking
an uneven
sidewalk

how many
shades of darkness
in the boston night?

pre-dawn flight
and to think i’ve never seen
walking dead

far from home
the river
in the clouds

clearing the runway
just how heavy
was that bag?

far from home
the scars
no one sees

cloud after cloud
that movie
i don’t want to watch

between connections
solo travelers
and their cellphones

final approach
i throw out
the stale scone

baja midnight
sweet whispers
of the ocean

always up early
the scorpion’s tail

crescent moon
the black cat’s
green eyes

by the sweat of their brow
someone else’s
million dollar view

making tracks
two dogs
in the desert

my favorite perfume
desert breeze
in her hair

tequila sunrise
the ocean pounding
in my head

evening news
a cockroach
skitters away

cape cod fog
it covers
everything

writer’s block
a silent mockingbird

desert morning
the distant clatter
of a water truck

desert haze
one margarita
too many

just beyond the waves
a beach dog
without a collar

a beautiful view
of all of the other
beautiful views

happy hour
a family of whales
near the shore

settling my bill
the bartender tells me
to practice my spanish

in the corner
in and out of consciousness
a cautionary tale

remembering
when mother said
to finish my dinner
and not ask questions

desert morning
peeling away
the fog

ordering in spanish
the bartender’s
generous pour

expat cafe
his and her ponytails
al fresco

breakfast al fresco
sharing an omelette
with flies

baja sunday
birds fly in and out
of an old cactus

summer twilight
she doesn’t care
what i’m thinking

called a snowflake
i realize
i’m not alone

waiting for her
to be in the mood
my beard turns gray

deafening silence
the crash
of my hard drive

turning another page
of the epic novel
desert breeze

knowing i can’t stay
wilted desert flower

monday morning
i push a door
marked pull

winter silence
the weathered wood
of our new home

in a foreign land
i give directions
to a stranger

winter storm watch
i pretend it’s happening
somewhere else

lily pads
planning
an estate sale

careful not to miss
daily mass
snow-covered gargoyles

another expat jogging
past the construction site
in bright-colored sneakers

not sure i signed up
for looking distinguished

each pounding wave
unrelentingly
soothing

in my dreams
an abandoned roller coaster
by the sea

restless night
wondering if the gecko
is truly happy

daydream
snow falling
in the moon’s shadow

rough surf
dolphins weave
around the whitecaps

blue-eyed senorita
desert sun rising
beyond the clouds

counting out
some random unit of time
the cement mixer

in the cracked plaster
a tree-lined horizon

ghost town
tourists welcome

baja sunset
the impatient ghosts

unable to sleep
another commercial
for sleeping pills

farewell canyon
every door
wide open

clear sky
we open up
a white wine

daybreak
awakening
to your nakedness

stiff breeze
subway cars
out of service

late to the parade
a clown
without a face

baja valentine
a norteno ballad
from the work site

all this time
you were watching
over me

camera-shy
an egret
in the basil field

baja speed bump
an old dog fast asleep
on the asphalt

a pair of hawks circling
a beautiful place
where i must never go

romantic dinner
a widower
and his dog

desert dream
a window
in the sand

false sunrise
i struggle to hear
the ocean

kiss me softly
so that i can hear
the ocean

the eyesore
of a beautiful
oceanfront home

black-tailed jackrabbit
running away
from ghosts

running away
from ghosts
a black-tailed jackrabbit

oceanfront construction
drowning out the sound
of the ocean

national emergency
a screaming baby
on the plane

final approach
i leave my daydreams
in the clouds

an overpriced vodka
to soothe the baby’s crying
in my ears

final descent
the uninhabited island
of my dreams

back from vacation
settling into
the sameness

town dump
so many things
that don’t spark joy

deportation hearing
not really hearing
anything

last call
fresh lipstick
on my shot glass

between where i am
and where i’m going
the rolling hillside

the rolling hillside
between where i am
and where i’m going

desert shadows
only they know
when the arroyo will run

melting snow
a car idling
in front of my house

trying to hear
the ocean
in the mass pike

still pond
i toss a coin
into the moon

silver dollar moon
the graffiti artist’s
bright bandanna

tomorrow’s weather
a pair of hawks
circling

snow moon
somewhere
beyond the snow

awaiting the diagnosis
my internet
dies

fresh snow
how many times
must i write about it?

slow news day
a lizard skitters
across the dune

performance art
i throw my alarm clock
at the mirror

open house
a frozen
koi pond

first date
the picasso
stares at me

on the beach
i surf the web
for surfing lessons

badlands
please keep telling me
it was only a dream

gibbous moon
and yet
the snow remains

late for breakfast
the dog
licks my face

first date
watching the sun
meet the horizon

snow moon
wondering if
they’re sold separately

snow moon
can’t i choose
one or the other?

snow moon
quitting
while i’m ahead

cruising altitude
the babies’ cries
synchronize

same time as yesterday
the same strangers meet
on a subway platform

weather advisory
everything
except frogs

the gps
in my head tells me
you have arrived

the day i got caught
drawing circles
in the sand

weather advisory
the bartender
cuts me off

snow moon
making way
for the snow

snow turns to rain
my wine glass
is empty

reaching for change
the dog treats
in my pocket

dimming the lights
a growing appreciation
for pearls

snow moon
a beacon
in the snow

night terror
it was only
a snow plow

smart move
my smartphone
turned off

covering the flowerbed
a sheet of ice

free press
an elevator
with broken buttons

still in syndication
a monkee
gone to heaven

a melting snowman
what’s left
of my childhood

fading dream
running after twilight

trickling down
the subway steps
melting snow

late for work
unable to find the glasses
on my head

a half-eaten dog toy
the play
within the play

an idiot’s guide
to winter weather
seasoned with road salt

the old forest
walking
among whispers

restless night
the ghost train
of my dreams

back to work
piles of plowed snow
still melting

waning moon
filling up bags
with old clothes

twenty ties
i’ll never wear
i keep ten of them

good morning, little schoolgirl
a plea bargain
for a billionaire

potluck
an unlabeled
casserole

silent auction
i bid
against myself

snow in the forecast
the dog
watches me shave

paradise
i flew all this way
just to sigh

wind advisory
i turn off
the news

my life
a boat adrift
surrounded by dreams

that dark place
where the truth
is a lie

always on time
the persistent
woodpecker

freezing rain
the glittering
danger

the power
of processed sugar
my granddaughter’s
dance recital

winter rain
the faded letters
of a tombstone

packing up my music
to the soundtrack
of pouring rain

winter fog
unable to find
the right words

winter fog
no one wonders
where i’ve been

end of the weekend
i’d like to thank
the academy

oscar night
a cold
winter wind

express train
brushing the hair
from her face

snow squall
an intermittent
tail light

late-season snow
i remind myself
to breathe

late-season snow
an unexpected
visitor

mixed precipitation
the doctor experiments
with my meds

morning headlines
a broken gate
flapping in the wind

construction zone
discovering a shortcut
to profits

winter nightmare
the old oak
explodes

like an auction
increasing forecast totals
of snow

so much depends upon
a broken wheelbarrow

harbor lights
especially
when i dream

balancing my checkbook
i spill
my cappuccino

when the yoga teacher
knows your name
and you’ve missed class
again

late-season storm
when no snow
is light snow

the arroyo
unwilling to share
its secrets

writer’s block
too many days
in february

stuffed in a drawer
the principal’s note
i never read

ignoring the forecast
the snow
keeps falling

from the front of the drawer
to the back
a sentimental journey

more slowly than forecast
the end of the storm

spring thaw
a double whiskey
on the rocks

pondering my success
i bow deeply
to pick up dog poop

million dollar view
the dog
needs a walk

meanwhile in suburbia
two teslas fight
over a charging station

snow in the forecast
the scrimshaw necklace
i never wore

waking from a dream
fresh footprints
in the snow

forbidden fruit
always
the sweetest

in other news
a pig
flatters a snake

sycophants
in praise of
balderdash

a shallow sigh
the snow
grows deeper

interrupting
my ocean dream
the slam
of a snowplow

writer’s block
the light
from a waning moon

late-season snow
a non-roster invitee

favorite son
always bearing
the best excuses

over kombucha
the free use of ghost
as a verb

forming an arch
over a country road
the old oak

between storms
a persistent
car alarm

yin and yang
the cat curls up
for a nap

the new espresso machine
my granddaughter’s
dance recital

standing at attention
windshield wipers
before a storm

all you can eat
cattle crowding
the feeding trough

tired of snow
i can’t wait
to shovel it!

still branches
weighed down
by heavy snow

shots fired
a snowplow
strikes pavement

winter mist
a lonely tombstone

shoveling snow
the lone and level sands
stretch far away

waning moon
the dim glow
of too much wine

tempest in a teapot
when i can’t find
the coffee grinder

instant rage
now trending
on twitter

after the storm
an altercation
among crows

dirty snow
a cocktail
with no recipe

snowblind
i call a colleague
by the wrong name

the old farmer
instead of weeding his garden
he’s gardening weed

dirty snow
what is
and isn’t zen

ash wednesday
a burned-out shell
of a man

ash wednesday
the assurance that goth
is alive and well

when she tells me
she’s wearing
mardis gras beads

deep winter
seagulls at the helm
of the fishing boat

dreams of ghosts
waking up
in different cities

it even sounds
like spring
blue jacaranda

new moon
a for sale sign
in front of our house

ghosts at the bar
the bartender
keeps wiping down
their spot

not yet spring
high school girls
waiting for the bus

his eulogy
an unpublished
haiku

new moon
i misplace
my glasses

falling snow
remembering
my dream

that place in the desert
where i realize the ghosts
have followed me

that moment in the desert
when i realize the ghosts
have followed me

winter thaw
the words
melt away

winter thaw
her nightgown
melts away

winter fog
the band plays
fade into you

loft space
a.k.a. a downtown closet
with a view

construction workers
put the finishing touches
on my hangover

barbie turns 60
my granddaughters
want ipads

late winter thaw
no need
to apologize

late-season snow
mom tells me i was
a surprise

daylight savings
one more hour
i won’t get back

daylight savings
the jukebox plays
an up-tempo song
to an empty bar

spring training
the veteran tries to recover
his curveball

snow changing to rain
changing the mood

my little dog
a heartbeat
at my feet

daylight savings
the time i save
not shoveling

welcoming
the robins’ song
winter rain

internet café
my cup
runneth empty

almost blue
i remember the color
of your eyes

warming trend
wondering if she still has
that bikini

the dive bar
at the end
of the rainbow

morning headlines
we call the darkness
light

printed out
on recycled paper
the new org chart

mud season
counting down
to the next election

warming trend
a smile
from a stranger

longer days
a missed shot
at the buzzer

fisherman’s grog
the glow
of sunrise

dirty snow
melting into
despair

closed for private event
the wide open spaces

dirty snow
no medals
for second best

rough seas
an empty
life raft

winter nightmare
crow’s feet
on my face

late winter thaw
the for sale sign
leaning at an angle

working away
in my barefooted dreams
the shoemaker’s ghost

packing our bags
i hope we forget
the rain

cleansing breath
facebook
takes a break

what keeps me up at night
a semicolon missing
from a dangling participle

taking a siesta
on the patio
he can’t think of
a single loanword

taste of spring
when the river
is an open window

winter dusk
before i can suppress
a sigh

the new normal
buying aspirin
in bulk

pi day
the band plays
an irrational number

where does the time go?
the cold, clear river

pay day
to bend
or not to bend
to pick up
a penny

the ides of march
a stabbing pain
in my back

late winter
a chipmunk
in the rain

winter thunder
a lumbering
snowplow

late winter freeze
a dog
staring at thunder

winter lightning
a freshman point guard
off the bench

the starlet’s lips
kissing me
from an old movie poster

weekend sunshine
how many nosy neighbors
at our open house?
