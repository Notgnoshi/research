    abstract={Vector representations of language, from tf-idf to word2vec, have
            fundamentally changed the way engineers and scholars approach the
            analysis of the written word. In this talk, I show my evolving
            practice using
            these representations not for analysis but instead as raw material
            for
            manipulation and generation of textual output. Starting with the
            analogy of
            audio/visual signal processing, I explore the affordances of this
            kind of
            manipulation for creating unique semantic, syntactic and
            phonological effects,
            working toward an experimental poetics of "textual waveforms." The
            talk
            includes an attempt to situate this practice in the context of the
            history and
            current practice of experimental poetry, alongside contemporary
            advances in
            language-oriented computational creativity.},

    abstract = {The increasing popularity of computational creativity (CC) in
            recent years
            gives rise to the need for educational resources. This paper
            presents several modules
            that together act as a guide for developing new CC courses as well
            as improving
            existing curricula. As well as introducing core CC concepts, we
            address pedagogical
            approaches to this interdisciplinary subject. An accessible
            overview of the field lets
            this paper double as an introductory tutorial to computational
            creativity.},
