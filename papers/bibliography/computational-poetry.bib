    abstract = { We describe computer-generated poetry techniques in the
            categories of mere generation, human enhancement and computer
            enhancement. We classify the different kinds of algorithm used to
            create
            poetry, and argue that the artificial intelligence techniques used
            by computer
            scientists are artistically relevant. We also use
            computer-generated music as
            an example to show that this three-level taxonomy applies to
            computational
            creativity in other fields. },
