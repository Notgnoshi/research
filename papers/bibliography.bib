            enhancement. We classify the different kinds of algorithm used to
            create
            poetry, and argue that the artificial intelligence techniques used
            by computer
            scientists are artistically relevant. We also use

            an example to show that this three-level taxonomy applies to

            practice using
            these representations not for analysis but instead as raw material
            for
            manipulation and generation of textual output. Starting with the
            analogy of
            audio/visual signal processing, I explore the affordances of this
            kind of
            manipulation for creating unique semantic, syntactic and
            phonological effects,
            working toward an experimental poetics of "textual waveforms." The
            talk
            includes an attempt to situate this practice in the context of the
            history and
            current practice of experimental poetry, alongside contemporary
            advances in
            language-oriented computational creativity.},
