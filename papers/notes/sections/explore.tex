    Perform exploratory data analysis.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Eliminate stop words and produce a word cloud.
        \item Expand/modify the English stop word list.
        \item Find and possibly remove outliers.
        \item Better clean the dataset.
        \item Understand if Zipf's law holds for haikus, or if some other relationship holds.
        \item Perform sentiment analysis.
        \item Perform topic modeling.
        \item Can haikus be clustered? How might they be clustered? By their topics? Length? Number
              of syllables?
    \end{itemize}
}
