\section{Data Sources and Cleaning}\label{sec:data}

\todoinline[caption={Find haiku dataset}]{
    Find haiku dataset, or for that matter determine if haikus are worth
    generating. Maybe some other form of poetry would work too.

    There are a number of sources online, but in aggregate there aren't many
    haikus. Definitely not enough for a decent training \textit{and} test set.
    Try to find PDF books of haikus. Maybe ask on IRC.

    All of the following should be done programmatically and reproducibly.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Download data
        \item Clean data
              \begin{itemize}
                  \item Remove duplicates
                  \item Remove haikus too similar to one another (levenstein or
                        cosine similarity)
                  \item Restrict the alphabet
              \end{itemize}
        \item Put it into a standard format
    \end{itemize}
}
