    Perform literature review.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Look at existing poetry generators and techniques.
        \item Read about the structure and meaning of haikus. This includes the
              thematic elements, syllable counts, and tradition.
        \item Research techniques for analyzing poetry style, themes, topics,
              etc.
        \item Review deep learning techniques for generating text based off of
              a training set.
        \item Google published a paper about a bidirectional network. I think
              it was called BERT. LSTM is unidirectional, so getting context in
              both directions could help significantly.
    \end{itemize}
